English: Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again
Japanese:


0572
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Japanese.
English: Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games.
Japanese:


0573
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Japanese.
English: Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world.
Japanese:


0574
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Japanese.
English: Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four.
Japanese:


0575
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Japanese.
English: That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself.
Japanese:


0576
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Japanese.
English: As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator.
Japanese:


0577
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Japanese.
English: However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes.
Japanese:


0578
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Japanese.
English: NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators.
Japanese:


0579
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Japanese.
English: All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up.
Japanese:


0580
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Japanese.
English: This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match.
Japanese:


0581
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Japanese.
English: Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be "huge risks" inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland.

Japanese:


1377
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Japanese.

Japanese:


1379
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Japanese.

Japanese:


1380
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Japanese.
English: With such a new project, trust can take time to build, and this panic was exploited by a series of articles, rumoured to have been paid for by rivals of the project, using the incorrect data to try to draw EverGrow investors away from the project.
Japanese:

English: In addition to the obvious benefits of USD rewards, the team behind the project have already launched a SWAP dApp on their website, have recently revealed the upcoming release of a Crypto Wallet, promising to surpass the features offered by Trust Wallet or Safemoon Wallet, and have a whole suite of utilities, from content creation platform to NFT Market Place & Lending, designed to bring continuous value to investors.

English: Is EverGrow Coin the next Shiba Inu?
Japanese:


1388

Japanese:


1389
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Japanese.

Japanese:


1435
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Japanese.
English: POSTECH announced on the 10th that a research team led by Professor Lee Jung-wook of the Department of Chemical Engineering has developed molecular diagnostic technology that can detect the Omicron variant in just 20-30 minutes and will publish the results online.
Japanese:


1436
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Japanese.

Japanese:


1445
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Japanese.

Instruction: Translate the following English text into Japanese.
English: In addition, this technology does not need specialized equipment, thus can make diagnostic kits simply and easily.
Japanese:


1447
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Japanese.
