English: Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again
Chinese:


0572
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Chinese.
English: Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games.
Chinese:


0573
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Chinese.
English: Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world.
Chinese:


0574
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Chinese.
English: Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four.
Chinese:


0575
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Chinese.
English: That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself.
Chinese:


0576
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Chinese.
English: As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator.
Chinese:


0577
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Chinese.
English: However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes.
Chinese:


0578
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Chinese.
English: NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators.
Chinese:


0579
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Chinese.
English: All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up.
Chinese:


0580
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Chinese.
English: This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match.
Chinese:


0581
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Chinese.
English: Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be "huge risks" inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland.

Instruction: Translate the following English text into Chinese.
English: One ground-breaking element of their project is the fact the token pays a stable currency to holders.
Chinese:


1377
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Chinese.
English: In the short time since launch, holders of EverGrow Coin have received over $30 million of binance-pegged USD rewards - a stable, regulated currency pegged 1-to-1 with the USD.
Chinese:

Instruction: Translate the following English text into Chinese.
English: The project currently has 110,000 holders according to BSCScan.
Chinese:


1379
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Chinese.
English: With their revolutionary contract, EverGrow Coin quickly grew to over $1 billion in market-cap, but then a major data error on CoinMarketCap, just weeks into the launch, caused mass panic amongst investors.
Chinese:


1380
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Chinese.
English: With such a new project, trust can take time to build, and this panic was exploited by a series of articles, rumoured to have been paid for by rivals of the project, using the incorrect data to try to draw EverGrow investors away from the project.
Chinese:


1381

Chinese:

Chinese:


1386
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Chinese.
English: In addition to the obvious benefits of USD rewards, the team behind the project have already launched a SWAP dApp on their website, have recently revealed the upcoming release of a Crypto Wallet, promising to surpass the features offered by Trust Wallet or Safemoon Wallet, and have a whole suite of utilities, from content creation platform to NFT Market Place & Lending, designed to bring continuous value to investors.

English: Is EverGrow Coin the next Shiba Inu?
Chinese:


1388
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Chinese.
English: With Shiba Inu, offering little to no utility, valued at around 66 times that of EverGrow Coin, there is a clear argument for an innovative and ground-breaking project like EverGrow to see some serious upside from their current low market cap.
Chinese:


1389
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Chinese.
English: If the team continues to impress the crypto community with their innovation and transparency and can shake off the fear spread among investors by the CoinMarketCap errors, there is a good chance EverGrow Coin could be one of the top cryptos to invest in for 2022.
