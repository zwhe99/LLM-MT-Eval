English: EverGrow Might Be The Next Big Crypto To Explode in 2022
Czech:


1036
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: Shiba Inu is the latest meme-crypto to go viral and despite being down almost 60% from it's all-time high, the market cap still stands at an eye-watering $20 billion, making it the 12th biggest crypto in the world by valuation.
Czech:


1037
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: A $100 investment at launch would be worth over $2 million today!
Czech:


1038
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: Many are no doubt kicking themselves for missing out on such gains, but the reality is that a bet on Shiba Inu was a pure gamble.
Czech:


1039
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: Shiba's run was a combination of some very smart marketing and a whole lot of hype, that led droves of investors, with FOMO (fear of missing out) to pile into the meme-coin.
Czech:


1040
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: Even the name itself, which was a homage to Elon Musk backed Dogecoin, was all part of the design.
Czech:


1041
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: In reality, Shiba Inu offers no tangible utility or value, with seemingly little effort to do so in the future.
Czech:


1042
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: Being on the Ethereum blockchain, there would've been plenty of opportunity for development had the team behind Shiba Inu been motivated to do so.
Czech:


1043
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: There are, however, several cryptocurrencies that are working to rise above the pack, and back their popularity with real utility and fundamental value.
Czech:


1044
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: Just 10 weeks ago, EverGrow Coin ($EGC) was launched by a team of experienced finance, blockchain and marketing experts.
Czech:


1045
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: One ground-breaking element of their project is the fact the token pays a stable currency to holders.
Czech:


1046
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: In the short time since launch, holders of EverGrow Coin have received over $30 million of binance-pegged USD rewards - a stable, regulated currency pegged 1-to-1 with the USD.
Czech:


1047
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: The project currently has 110,000 holders according to BSCScan.
Czech:


1048
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: With their revolutionary contract, EverGrow Coin quickly grew to over $1 billion in market-cap, but then a major data error on CoinMarketCap, just weeks into the launch, caused mass panic amongst investors.
Czech:


1049
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: With such a new project, trust can take time to build, and this panic was exploited by a series of articles, rumoured to have been paid for by rivals of the project, using the incorrect data to try to draw EverGrow investors away from the project.
Czech:


1050
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: Over the next month, the errors remained unfixed, and EverGrow sunk to below $300 million in valuation.
Czech:


1051
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: Yesterday, CoinMarket Cap placed an alert on EverGrow's page, confirming that the data error had been fixed.
Czech:


1052
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: The price has now stabilised, and signs of returning confidence saw an increase of 22% from the recent lows.
Czech:


1053
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: However, EverGrow still remains well below the highs achieved before this error.
Czech:


1054
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: EverGrow is very different from Shiba Inu.
Czech:


1055
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: In addition to the obvious benefits of USD rewards, the team behind the project have already launched a SWAP dApp on their website, have recently revealed the upcoming release of a Crypto Wallet, promising to surpass the features offered by Trust Wallet or Safemoon Wallet, and have a whole suite of utilities, from content creation platform to NFT Market Place & Lending, designed to bring continuous value to investors.
Czech:


1056
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: Is EverGrow Coin the next Shiba Inu?
Czech:


1057
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: With Shiba Inu, offering little to no utility, valued at around 66 times that of EverGrow Coin, there is a clear argument for an innovative and ground-breaking project like EverGrow to see some serious upside from their current low market cap.
Czech:


1058
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: If the team continues to impress the crypto community with their innovation and transparency and can shake off the fear spread among investors by the CoinMarketCap errors, there is a good chance EverGrow Coin could be one of the top cryptos to invest in for 2022.

Czech:


1692
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games.
Czech:


1693
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world.
Czech:


1694
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four.
Czech:


1695
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself.
Czech:


1696
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator.
Czech:


1697
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes.
Czech:


1698
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators.
Czech:


1699
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up.
Czech:


1700
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match.
Czech:


1701
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Czech.
English: Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be "huge risks" inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland.
