English: Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again
Ukrainian:


0572
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Ukrainian.
English: Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games.
Ukrainian:


0573
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Ukrainian.
English: Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world.
Ukrainian:


0574
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Ukrainian.
English: Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four.
Ukrainian:


0575
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Ukrainian.
English: That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself.
Ukrainian:


0576
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Ukrainian.
English: As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator.
Ukrainian:


0577
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Ukrainian.
English: However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes.
Ukrainian:


0578
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Ukrainian.
English: NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators.
Ukrainian:


0579
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Ukrainian.
English: All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up.
Ukrainian:


0580
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Ukrainian.
English: This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match.
Ukrainian:


0581
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Ukrainian.
English: Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be "huge risks" inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland.

1389
Instruction: Translate the following English text into Ukrainian.
