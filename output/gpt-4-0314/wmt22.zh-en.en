English: At Zhejiang University Academic Annual Conference, students take the leading role, and their research achievements open people's minds - Xinhua News
English: Using air to wash hands, diagnosing diseases with a breath, and accurately tracing the source of smog: Last night, at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University's 2016 Academic Annual Meeting, a series of groundbreaking academic achievements were honored.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, and their research covers various fields, such as environment, mechanical, energy, medical, life sciences, humanities and education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biosensors: Your Family Health Check Doctor
The Biomedical Engineering College's doctoral student Zhang Diming's team demonstrated an on-site smartphone bio-sensor, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to take a gentle breath, and this device can preliminarily detect your health condition from the composition of your exhaled gas."
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to smartphones, and after exhaling, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
In the market, the smart bracelets that can monitor health status usually detect physical parameters such as temperature, pulse, etc.
The biological sensor system utilizes a new material called graphene, which targets chemical elements. Its sensitive "sense of smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health condition.
Intelligent Surgical Lamp: Doctor's High-energy Eyes
In addition to smartphones, operating rooms have also started using intelligent surgical lights.
This invention won the silver award at the 44th Geneva International Exhibition of Inventions in Switzerland this year.
The Graduate School of Optoelectronics Science and Engineering, with master's students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, have come up with new ideas addressing the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps. They invented the Intelligent LED Shadowless Surgical Lamp.
Many diseases are not detected early or adequately removed, which is related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room.
Shen Junfei says that, for example, during early cancer screening, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, the cancer cells will continue to spread later.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp discs, which enhance the contrast of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the light spectrum.
During the surgical procedure, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowless rate of the light spot according to the needs of the surgery and personal habits at any time.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital and Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received positive feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: Saving water and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands by rinsing with water, at most using some soap or a bit of hand sanitizer. However, Li Qizhang and his classmates have invented a set of "air hand washing device."
As long as we stand on the device's sink, our weight can compress the air to come out.
English: "Just like an air pump."
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet, which combines with the water.
This way, we can wash our hands clean!
The colorimetric reaction and bacterial residue experiment show that the effectiveness of hand washing using this method is the same as that of the conventional hand washing method.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can ensure the cleanliness while saving 90% of water. The entire process is completely energy-free, energy-saving, and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the 2nd Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among numerous world-leading universities and won the sole gold award.

A very meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the important skill certificates I have, besides my driver's license!
Popularize this: Emergency first aid measures are actually taken during unexpected situations as emergency rescue, that is, the rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is actually a period of time between the occurrence of an accident and the arrival of the ambulance, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
English: This is the time when emergency assistance is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or sudden respiratory arrest, then the window of our life is only four minutes – the golden four minutes!
So it's so important for the people around us to know first aid!
English: When someone around us collapses, we can rescue them using professional knowledge instead of standing there foolishly, unable to do anything. This helpless feeling is too terrifying.
In China, according to official data, three million people die accidentally every year, with the most dangerous cause being sudden cardiac arrest.
In the United States, the average survival rate is 15%.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, the recovery rate is 70-80%, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%.
This is what the founder of First Reaction, Lu Le, said.
If a person experiences sudden cardiac arrest, loses their breath, and has no heartbeat, pinching the "Ren Zhong" acupuncture point will have no effect.
It is necessary to perform artificial respiration and chest compressions in order to possibly save a person's life.
I found that there are still very few people who have the awareness to learn first aid now, but when something happens, it is too late. Therefore, I still appeal to everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in a timely manner when facing emergencies.
Perhaps it could even save a person's life!
First aid certificates can be registered at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are discounts for students as well.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I want to complete before turning 25. Adding the first aid certificate to the goal list was a few months ago, but it has indeed been accomplished!
Next, I plan to take exams for other certificates I'm interested in, such as a diving certificate. I previously saw on Xiaohongshu that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that to take this exam, one must have a first aid certificate first, so actually, the first aid certificate is quite useful!
English: I ordered #NUMBER#.
Among them, there's only one shrimp dumpling for 13 yuan!?
Have not tried
English: Why didn't #NAME# make it clear?
English: One costs 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed delivering the meal, and this time they only give me one shrimp dumpling to eat!?
English: Because I clearly saw that the code was valid when I entered it before
First, to state the conclusion, I personally think that "Four Seas" is a comprehensive bad movie, in every sense of the word.
But if you say this movie doesn't have a single highlight, that's not true either, at least the choice of soundtrack is pretty good.
There are many types of bad movies, one kind is the kind that makes you fall asleep soundly in the cinema, another kind makes you feel indignant after watching it. For the audience, "Four Seas" is like the monkeys on Mount Emei, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
English: In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is truly unparalleled in his talent.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation from a K-series novel, indescribable, and full of flaws, just like the trench coat on Little Brother Marco.
English: After watching it, you may even wonder if there's any hidden metaphor implied by the director. But when you think about it carefully, you'll realize it's actually just a piece of shit.
First, let me briefly mention some of the plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist's residence should be on a small island in the south, where he relies on his grandmother for survival.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and then the plot arranged a neighborly uncle to drive her to the northeast in a minivan to see the snow.
Elderly people taking a minivan from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his father are very confident about this.
English: And then there was no more information about this old person.
How did the female lead's brother obtain a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the island's car-racing gangsters easily block off a section of the mountain road?
Then, the truck carrying steel bars stopped by the side of the road, and even the truck driver could not be found in the surrounding area.
This prop is way too obvious, isn't it?
Why would a person with poor credit and suspected illegal activities, who is also a member of a motorbike gang, become an auxiliary police officer?
Why not report loan sharking to the police, and in the movie, the police specifically asked if there were any difficulties?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door at a hotel. Then, they forcefully arrange to find the hotel owner but can't find them, so they end up sleeping outside the room door for the night.
This inexplicable plot is filled throughout the entire film, and the absurdity of the storyline is so intense that it causes me pain when I recall them.
Besides the plot, what's even worse is the theme of the movie, or rather, the lack of a theme. It's just a hideous patchwork monster.
At the beginning of the film, you might think it's a comedy, and after 20 minutes, you might guess it's an inspirational film. Halfway through, you feel that it might be a drama showcasing the difficulties of small-town youth's survival. After finishing, you really don't know what you've watched, and what follows is deep self-doubt. Why should one go to the theater to watch such a film during the festive season?
For most people, they are actually very familiar with various movie formulas. For example, if you want to make a film about a motorcycle rider, you should combine motivational themes and comedy, and then show the audience how a talented newbie gradually works their way towards success.
English: If you want to make a romance film, then you should honestly depict the entangled love-hate relationship between a small town youth who loves riding motorcycles and a waitress.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least your plot should not contain things that contradict the normal world.
For example, the character played by Yin Zheng, whose new motorcycle was burnt and could still sing, should not be involved in some bizarre scenarios that even Kennedy couldn't stand.
As for the female lead, although she is clearly not intellectually challenged, she sometimes acts like a 5-year-old child in some aspects. I really don't know if this is due to her acting skills or the director's requirements.
There is one thing I also don't quite understand - why is Han Han, as a race car driver, so keen on adding car crash scenes in his own movies?
Is arranging such a movie during the Spring Festival slot meant to cause inconvenience to the audience?

Inspection of well concrete module production and processing equipment, Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment assembly site:
Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment - Features and advantages of Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment:
English: The Yixin inspection well block brick machine equipment is widely applicable to new masonry materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas.
English: For example: various types of inspection wells, rainwater inlets, square ditches, septic tanks, and small-sized structures for drainage and water storage facilities, as well as bridge abutments, etc.
English: The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells lies in the fact that all four sides of the module (top, bottom, left, and right) have a concave-convex groove structure, which forms a chain-lock when combined and stacked together.
English: The shear resistance of well wall structures is far superior to that of smooth friction masonry construction forms.
The module has a hollow structure. After the combination and construction, the vertical holes are connected, and the horizontal holes run through each other. After casting the core, a cast-in-place concrete mesh structure is formed, which provides secondary reinforcement and waterproofing effects.
The module is equipped with reinforcement grooves in both vertical and horizontal directions, and the horizontal and vertical reinforcements correspondingly enhance the overall structural strength.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells constructed using concrete inspection well modules are less likely to experience collapse, subsidence, and water leakage. The mechanical properties of the well wall modules are stable, the operation is simple, and the dimensions are standardized.
English: The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment features intelligent control, equipped with data input and output devices, one-touch LCD display for monitoring the entire mechanical operation process, achieving the ideal human-machine interaction, automatic analysis of material ratios, density operation, safety logic control, and fault diagnosis system.
English: The well wall module mechanical hydraulic system adopts single-cylinder hydraulic transmission and double-cylinder hydraulic transmission.
Independent hydraulic integrated station, which avoids the impact of the main engine vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system's operation.
English: The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment material box advances, the mold box rises, the storage hopper door closes, the automatic conveyor pallet is transported, all of which are independently completed by the hydraulic system, thereby reducing the wear and maintenance of the machinery.
English: The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computers, electrical appliances, seals, and hydraulic parts, ensuring that the equipment's overall performance is stable and reliable.
English: The mechanical vibration platform of well wall modules adopts whole steel plate, with tabletop linear cutting and no welding points, enabling the material filling box to swing freely and guide, thus greatly reducing mechanical wear and tear.
To reduce mold load, integrate filling and amplitude encryption in a two-in-one approach, adopt a unified and fully synchronized system, with platform vibration and mold vibration, to ensure the achievement of solid vibration effects.
English: The well wall module mechanical vibration machine, with computer automatic control of amplitude according to the material cost ratio, features a non-wearing braking system, thus extending its service life and reducing costs.
English: The well wall module has both mechanical automatic control and manual control dual functions.

Chongqing vocational schools pilot modern apprenticeships, enrollment is equivalent to being a prospective employee - Xinhua News
English: Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting from this year, our city will pilot the "Modern Apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 vocational schools. Students who are accepted for the pilot training will also have the status of apprentices. After being enrolled, they will be pre-registered as employees by the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires standardization of enrollment and employment procedures in secondary vocational schools and enterprises, clarifying the dual identities of apprentices as secondary vocational school students and quasi-employees of enterprises. In accordance with the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools, and enterprises shall sign tripartite agreements. For apprentices between 16 and 18 years old, agreements must be signed by the apprentice, the guardian, the school, and the enterprise, defining the rights and interests of all parties, as well as the specific positions, teaching content, and protection of rights and interests in the on-the-job training of the apprentices.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship formats and jointly carry out pre-job training and job-transfer training for enterprise employees with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools need to reform talent training models.
English: Schools and enterprises collaborate on designing talent training programs, jointly formulating professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
English: The pilot program has a trial period based on the education system, and the internship duration for students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training plan, with the standard internship generally lasting for 6 months.
In corporate practice, the enterprise team management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different professions, one master can lead 2 to 5 apprentices, forming a study group to ensure that students master the skills required for each training position proficiently.
English: According to the plan, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has identified 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilot programs in three batches, with about 50 participants in each pilot, and trained a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices).
In accordance with the principle of piloting first and then promoting, and gradually advancing from point to point, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for the joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education between schools and enterprises, effectively improve students' job skills, and increase the matching employment rate and employment quality of students.

South African Doctor: Omicron's transmissibility is strong, but mostly presents as mild cases
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus are milder than those of the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, with the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, a physician organization consisting of over 5,000 doctors in Gauteng Province reports that the symptoms of their current COVID-19 patients are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughs, which are similar to flu-like symptoms.
The organization's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them have needed hospitalization so far.
Pilai said: "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of quarantine."
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are originally more susceptible to falling into severe conditions due to coronavirus infections.
He said, compared to that, in the previous wave of the Delta outbreak, the COVID-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people have to be hospitalized within a few days.
In the two weeks following the first report of the Omicron variant in Southern Africa, other doctors have also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take a few weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, among the COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks, only 30% have severe symptoms, half the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave of the pandemic. The average hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days. Among the recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% have died, whereas in the early outbreak in South Africa, the death rate reached 20%.
African Health Research Institute Director Willem Hanekom, citing data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, said, "Currently, almost all indications suggest that this is a milder disease."
He also said, "It is still early, and we need to obtain later-stage data."
Under normal circumstances, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we have only been in this wave of the epidemic for two weeks.
At the same time, scientists from all around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while also testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
English: Although Delta is still the dominant COVID-19 strain worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases in Haodeng Province increased by 400% in the first week of December, and tests showed that more than 90% of the cases were of the Omicron variant.
Thank you to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been given out!

Education Commentary: What does it take to save abducted children?
If we make an analogy with the famous public service advertisement slogan, "Without buying and selling, there will be no killing," then in a good environment with no demand for abduction, the whole community can work together to prevent and combat human trafficking. By making human trafficking unprofitable, high-risk, and high-cost, this kind of crime will no longer occur frequently.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched an emergency platform for releasing information on missing children, developed by the Anti-abduction Office.
English: This is an authoritative Internet information platform created for the establishment of a child missing information release channel, and for the timely recovery of abducted children.
Upon hearing that this App is called "Reunion," I instantly feel heartwarming.
The new technology is not only named "literary and artistic", full of feelings, but also properly applied in information technology, practical, and effective.
In combating human trafficking, the primary goal is to find and rescue the abducted children, ensuring their personal safety and freedom.
Next comes the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment ranges from individual penalties and social prevention to legal education, and many "big words" can be listed.
English: Before solving the kidnapping and trafficking cases, the priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
In terms of priority and urgency, under the pressing goal of "searching and rescuing", controversial topics such as "whether child trafficking should be punishable by death" can be temporarily set aside for cautious discussion; however, the matter of rescuing abducted children cannot wait.
Based on the investigation experience of such cases, human traffickers tend to quickly move away from the crime scene after successfully abducting someone.
The longer the search for a kidnapped child is delayed, the further the child may be from their parents, and the more difficult it becomes to solve the case.
In this situation, implementing practical actions such as using the "Reunion" platform, which directly helps in solving cases and finding missing children, is indeed a pragmatic approach.
After all, "fighting against abduction" is a major task that requires the operation of the entire legal system to be done well.
Combat crime, protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the perfection of legislation, to the guarantee of justice, and the meticulous enforcement of the law, all require the implementation of the care for "protecting the young and supporting the vulnerable".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be improved from family to society.
For example, a common case is when a family of three rests at a train station, the parents fall asleep, and upon waking up, they realize that their child has gone missing.
You can't expect a two-year-old child to have enough self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have a considerable awareness of protection.
Parents taking turns to rest and placing their child under reliable protection are the most basic measures to prevent child abduction.
English: From another perspective of the police crackdown on abduction and trafficking crimes, the buyers of abducted children should also be given attention and punished.
A single wrongful act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the Criminal Law of our country, the starting sentence for the crime of child trafficking is 5 years; in cases of particularly serious circumstances, the sentence can be up to the death penalty, along with the confiscation of property.
The starting point for punishment is high, and the maximum penalty is heavy. Under the general trend of "lighter punishment", the crime of child trafficking obviously belongs to the more severe punishment category.
Even today, a considerable number of human trafficking cases still occur every year.
It can be seen that some people's concepts in raising children are outdated, and their legal awareness is weak.
The legal education for this group of people should be carried out synchronously.
To effectively control human trafficking crimes, it cannot rely solely on strict law enforcement by the government.
English: If the kidnapping "market" is widespread, the kidnappers will be blinded by greed and constantly innovate their methods, forming a "battle of wits" situation with law enforcement. Anti-kidnapping operations will inevitably be caught in a quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking the outdated concepts and popularizing legal knowledge can also help to eradicate the crimes of kidnapping, buying and selling children.
English: Yang Haodong gives a lecture on the spirit of the 19th Sixth Plenary Session of the Party and the Provincial Party Congress at Malanshan
Draw strength for progress from the century-long struggle of the Party
Hunan Daily, December 10th news (full media reporter Gong Baiwei) According to the unified arrangement of the provincial party committee, on the morning of December 10th, Yang Haodong, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, conducted an interactive lecture at Malanshan Video and Cultural Innovation Park. The focus was on the in-depth study and implementation of the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Party Congress, the study and implementation of the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches and instructions on Hunan, as well as the study and implementation of the spirit of the 12th Provincial Party Congress.
English: Yang Haodong elaborated on the core essence and practical requirements of the plenary session spirit from three aspects: ideal faith and original mission, self-revolution and youth in the big party, and the party's leaders and the party's theories. He combined his own perceptions and personal experiences to provide an in-depth, simple, comprehensive, and systematic explanation.
He pointed out that it is necessary to combine the spirit of the plenary session with the important speeches and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping on Hunan, as well as the spirit of the Provincial Party Congress. We must learn, understand, and apply the knowledge comprehensively, strengthen the ideological, political, and action consciousness of safeguarding the "two establishments" and achieving the "two maintenances", and resolutely follow the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
During the interactive communication session, representatives from grassroots-level cadres, enterprises, and youth discussed the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of the "two establishments," how cultural enterprises can grasp the right direction, and how the youth in the new era can draw strength from the hundred-year history of the party. Yang Haodong answered each question with simple language and vivid examples. He earnestly advised young party members to draw progressive strength from the party's hundred-year history, closely unite around the Party Central Committee, resolutely follow the party, and dedicate their youth to fulfilling their responsibilities and performing their duties.

The International Olive Oil Association classifies olive oil into two main categories and five levels: Virgin Olive Oil and Refined Olive Oil (also known as Lampante Olive Oil).
First press olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is the oil obtained by mechanically cold pressing directly from fresh olive fruit and then removing impurities through filtering and other treatments.
English: According to the different acidity levels, it can be divided into three categories:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: This is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant aroma, and an acidity not exceeding 1%.
High-quality virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: Has acceptable taste and flavor, with acidity not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after refining virgin olive oil with an acidity level exceeding 3.3% or becoming "secondary oil."
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Ordinary Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of extra virgin olive oil to balance the taste and color. Its acidity is below 1.5%, and it appears as a transparent light golden-yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: It is an olive oil obtained by extracting from the pomace and refining through the solvent method.
After looking at the grade classification, you should have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You should know that olives are like grapes used for making wine. Olives from different regions and varieties will produce olive oil with different standards.
English: The best growing area for olive oil:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for olive growth, including temperature, sunshine, air humidity, and precipitation.
Apart from the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only sporadically cultivate in suitable areas.
Main production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and so on, along with countries with similar climates such as far south latitude Argentina, Peru, South Africa, and so on.
English: Olive oil harvest month:
Every year from March to June is the time for olive trees to bloom and bear fruit. Between July and October, the fruits start to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, then purple, and finally turning black.
English: November to February of the following year is the fruit harvesting season (the freshness of olive oil is very important, you know).
English: Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, including oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition found so far.
The Democracy Summit concludes, Biden declares the flame of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy" convened by US President Biden, attended by government, civil society, and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, concluded on Friday (December 10th).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of people all around the world, and authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also stated that the second Global "Democracy Summit" is planned to be held next year.
English: Taiwan government representative and Minister Tang Feng, along with Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong, who is currently in exile in the United Kingdom, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said: "We know how daunting the task ahead of us is.
But we also know that we can face the challenges, because as I have said before, and as this summit demonstrates, the democratic world is everywhere.
Autocratic regimes can never extinguish the sparks of freedom, which burn in the hearts of people all over the world.
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
He said, "As government leaders, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the safeguards of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, and better withstand the buffering and impact forces of authoritarianism, as well as those who nakedly pursue power before the public interest."
The themes for the second day of the "Democracy Summit" are safeguarding human rights, consolidating democracy and countering authoritarianism, as well as combating digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day happens to coincide with "International Human Rights Day."
United Nations Secretary-General Guterres also stated in his opening speech that day that the cause of democracy is facing challenges globally, especially the challenges brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said, "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values, stance, and democratic resilience."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality issues, combating corruption, renewing social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution. "
Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong delivers a speech at the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continuously pay attention to the human rights situations of Hong Kong and ethnic minorities in China, such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans.
He said, "For a long time, the world has been witnessing the rise of China but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable.
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must utilize everything we have (resources) to ensure the revival of democracy is our top priority.
Joshua Wong also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said, "Perhaps some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you do not want to lose the Chinese market, and perhaps some of you have not realized the threat of the Chinese Communist Party to our democratic values."
And this is the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason why we must change.
Taiwan's Executive Yuan Minister Tang Feng attended the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism, Affirming Democratic Values" and released the "National Statement" through a video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against dictatorship and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said, "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, playing a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have rationalized violations of human rights in the name of public health and collective interests, showing signs of global democratic regression.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without having to lockdown, and we can combat fake information without having to remove it from the shelves.
English: On the second day of the "Democracy Summit" agenda, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China and North Korea, who were deemed to have seriously violated human rights. At the same time, investment restrictions were imposed on a Chinese company that was identified as assisting in human rights violations using surveillance technology.
I have already taken a photo and uploaded it for you.
I know.
But the restaurant keeps delaying the delivery time for some unknown reason.

In short, I won't call anymore.
Not eating anymore

Why didn't you say earlier that you couldn't deliver it?
Waiting for you for so long
No, I haven't received the call.
Please inform him to deliver it to our company again.

Hello, the saliva chicken delivered by the restaurant is raw.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I'd like to find a similar price for practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price often has a direct relationship with the level of friendliness. If you can't distinguish between them, then under normal circumstances, expensive ones are friendlier than cheaper ones. This kind of "beginner's choice" is actually industrial waste.
Their intensity is very low, and when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very strong. They can't withstand hard balls, and even experts have difficulty controlling them.
The underlying logic and implication here are - tennis is so difficult, they know you won't be able to learn it and that you are not willing to buy expensive equipment. So, they provide you with cheap stuff to deceive you. You will play a couple of times and then give up, making the cheap racket affordable and not a heartache for you.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means you've improved. At that time, come back to my store to buy the expensive ones, and I'll make money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar amount of money to buy a better second-hand racket, choose either Prince or Dunlop brands, as these two brands are not famous enough, so the good rackets are not expensive. A new racket costing around 500-600 RMB is good enough, and a second-hand one for 200 RMB allows you to enjoy the experience of using a thousand RMB racket, isn't that a great deal?
It is quite user-friendly for beginners, but once past the beginner stage, it becomes less appealing. However, for most people, especially girls, they cannot get past the beginner stage.
The order has been delayed for delivery multiple times.
Excuse me, could you please help me follow up on this?
Postpone
Thank you
English: That is to say, actually, I already have the credit?
Do I need to place a new order next? Can I disregard the previous one?
Hello, I ordered food from this restaurant, but a lot of items were missing in the delivered food, and the saliva chicken was also raw.

In fact, there are many considerations for dressing and matching clothes for girls with a slightly plump figure.
The skirt worn by a chubby girl should not be too short or too long; the length should be around the knee, just enough to cover the chubby part of the thigh.
A skirt that is too short will reveal the fat on the legs.
English: If it's too long, it will give people a feeling of being short and fat.
If you dress in three sections: upper, middle, and lower, it will make you appear taller naturally. That is, if you use different colors for the top, skirt, and knee-high socks, it will create a visually elongating effect.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard choices for slightly overweight girls (the author has deep experience in this), and dark colors are a good way to conceal your body fat. The noble and elegant black short skirt is also the top choice for slightly overweight girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothing, especially black skirts, can make you appear slimmer.
If your calves are fat, don't wear socks and shoes that attract too much attention.
The more popular the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
In order to avoid people noticing your legs and feet and giving a feeling of obesity.
For slightly chubby girls, it is important to discuss the tips and tricks of good clothing pairing.
Plump girls should avoid wearing tight short skirts, and don't wear tops that are too short or tucked into the skirt, as it can make people feel uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, wear black long stockings or fishnet stockings (the small grid type). Choose soft-textured, printed flared skirts and pair them with a boat-neck top, which can effectively conceal a plus-sized girl's imperfections.
Of course, slightly chubby girls also have their own considerations when wearing short skirts.
Fat girls wearing short skirts should choose tops with the same color as the skirt, as this will make your plump figure look taller.
Short skirts paired with high heels can make your legs appear longer, which is the trendiest combination in the summer!
English: If you are a girl with a heavier upper body but skinny legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous short dress.
Not only can it cover your belly, but it can also highlight your strengths.
A-line skirts can make one look slimmer and are more suitable for plus-sized girls. For tops, it is better to choose something tighter to create a sense of layers and make one appear slimmer.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt can also be tried by plus-size women.
Slightly chubby girls can also wear fashionable outfits.
As long as one can master the rules of dressing and matching, slightly chubby girls can also become the center of attention for everyone.
After making changes in clothing and matching, also engage in more physical activities in daily life, and strive to get rid of the "slightly chubby girl" label as soon as possible 😄

Xinhua All Media+ | Beijing Youth Ice Hockey League Boosts Winter Olympics Enthusiasm - Xinhua News Agency

This league consists of regular season and playoffs, with participating athletes ranging from U6 to U18 in age. The competition is divided into competitive and selection groups, attracting a total of nearly 3,600 players from 256 representative teams across the city.

The league plays a leading role in promoting ice hockey among young people in Beijing, fueling the enthusiasm for ice hockey in the Winter Olympics, and laying the foundation for the development of ice hockey in Beijing in the post-Winter Olympics period.
Girl becomes an arrow target to raise funds for her sister: "Thinking it's just a flesh wound makes it bearable" - Xinhua Net
English: A girl stands in front of a large wooden board at Wulin Square in Hangzhou, with the words "Human target, ten yuan per arrow" written on the board.
English: Yesterday morning, a photo of a Hangzhou girl willingly becoming a "target" to raise donations for her sister went viral in social circles.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person at Hangzhou's Wulin Square. The board reads "Human target, 10 yuan per arrow," suggesting that passers-by can pay to shoot arrows using a bow and arrow.
The behavior sparked heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, the person in charge of publicity from the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau's Xiacheng Branch confirmed to a reporter from the Beijing News that the police have verified that the girl took such radical actions to raise funds for her elder sister. However, this kind of behavior is not worth promoting. After being admonished, the girl has already left the local police station yesterday.
Girl's street "arrow target" fundraising warned
In the viral photo, a long-haired girl stands in a "human" shape in front of a large wooden board, on which is written in black ink, "Human target, 10 yuan per arrow." In front of her, another wooden board displays her bank account number, as well as her WeChat and Alipay account information.
The image sparked controversy after being posted online.
Some netizens believe that this is an act of "begging for attention", while many others have expressed sympathy for the situation.
"We discovered the situation around 10 am on the 23rd when we were patrolling near the square, and there were already quite a few onlookers at that time."
English: The police officer from Tianshui Police Station near the incident site said in an interview with local media that there were two girls running the stall, both around 20 years old, dressed youthfully and beautifully.
Among them, the girl acting as the "human target" kept crying, asking passers-by to play the game; another girl was helping to draw attention, saying that her friend's sister has leukemia and is in urgent need of surgery fees, and asking everyone for help.
"We have contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl is raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the head of publicity of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau's Xiacheng Branch told the Beijing News reporter that this girl's name is Ji Jiali, and she is raising funds for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, due to the treatment still requiring more than 300,000 yuan in expenses and not being able to think of a good fundraising method, they resorted to this kind of behavior.
He said, during the whole process, two girls were involved, one as the target and the other as the assistant, but neither of them actually participated in it. No one was found shooting arrows throughout the process, but some people were watching and took photos, which were later posted on Weibo.
After the police conducted an appraisal through the public security department, it was determined that the bow and arrows used were not within the scope of control.
The person in charge said, "We do not advocate using this kind of attention-seeking fundraising method."
After being cautioned by the police at the police station, she has already left the police station.
Heat Dissipation Effect: Good Thinness Level: Convenient Appearance Material: Satisfactory Acer has always had a high cost-performance ratio.
The new machine is very good.
The performance is stable, with four air outlets for heat dissipation without any issues. It is worth recommending.
This Acer Shadow Knight gaming laptop is quite good, with solid workmanship and materials, and it's a reliable brand!
The price of the Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is not considered expensive.
In my personal opinion, the Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is really good. Gaming performance: The gaming experience is smooth, and it can handle most games with ease. My PUBG runs at high settings with stable frame rates, making it extremely smooth. It has no problem running games like LOL, and it can easily handle CS:GO as well. It can play most AAA games too.
Heat dissipation effect: The heat dissipation effect is good, the fan is very powerful, and it is quite quiet when used for work. However, when gaming with full effects, the fan is still not that small.
Exterior Material: The appearance is quite cool, suitable for the gaming laptop style. Display Effect: The screen is very clear, 1080 resolution is enough for playing games.
Buying this notebook is really quite good, mainly used for design work. The price-performance ratio is very high, it's lighter than I imagined, and looks better than I expected. The red color on the back is a very beautiful wine color, not so vulgar. Overall, it exceeds my expectations by a lot, and it's worth the purchase. It's also quite suitable for girls.
Two years ago, I started using the Acer Aspire Dark Knight. After using it for two years, I found it to be cost-effective and of excellent quality!
I also recommend my friends around me to purchase this product!
Currently, I have already purchased 3 models from this series!
The appearance is beautiful and attractive, and the configuration is also very good.
Bought it for my nephew, originally wanted to wait for the 418 bank promotion, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance, and as a result, I didn't catch the big bank event, which is a bit regrettable.
However, the cost-performance ratio is quite high, and the logistics are pretty fast. I will come back to review it after using it for a while.
Brand new original, a gaming laptop with extremely high cost-performance ratio, with a very nice design style. Windows 11 and Office 2019 have already been installed.
Display effect: Bought this for the child to use for 3D rendering, the software is already installed, the child said it can be used without any problem, this computer's performance for 3D design work is good.
Bought for my son, he said it's very good.
The computer is pretty good, especially the customer service attitude is very good. If you don't understand, just ask. I recommend purchasing.
Not bad, the graphics quality when playing games is really delightful.

English: A while ago, there was a popular article titled "Take a look! The Olympic events that project managers can win gold medals in". It mentioned that project managers can definitely be the leaders in many projects, unmatched in their abilities. Moving bricks, going on business trips, and staying up late are part of their daily routines; firefighting, taking responsibility for mistakes, and apologizing are even more a matter of course.
An article that seems to be joking and teasing, but it also reveals the daily hardships of project managers, representing their inability to cope with the current project management work.
People engaged in project management work are gradually choosing to take some actions to free themselves from the predicaments in their jobs.
From the increasing number of PMP (Project Management Professional with international certification) registrations every year, it can be seen that more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the "Twenty Years of China Project Management Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® examinees in China reached nearly 600,000, with approximately 420,000 people passing the PMP® certification and about 300,000 people holding valid certificates, accounting for 31.2% of the global total number of PMP® certifications.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certificate holders has increased year by year, which indicates that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply rely on the "old experience." The ever-changing work environment requires us to learn and explore the path forward by standing on the shoulders of scientific giants.
However, can obtaining the PMP certification guarantee smooth project management work?
Many project management beginners have stated that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major fields and five major process groups of project management, and other related knowledge points. However, when actually carrying out project management work, they still find themselves confused.
Many project managers often report the following issues: Inadequate understanding of project management, relying solely on personal experience, having only theoretical knowledge of project management without knowing how to put it into practice; Lack of systematic project management processes and institutional support, unable to implement in the work, inaccurate project estimates, poor control sensitivity, and projects dragging on; Unclear division of labor among team members, not knowing how to deal with the "old hands" in the team, poor communication between departments, making it difficult for the projects to progress...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than a decade, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting has helped many outstanding enterprises cultivate a large number of key R&D personnel such as product managers and project managers, and has won honorable titles such as "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base".

Jie Xin advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double Twelve" - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double 11" shopping festival saw a national online payment transaction amount reaching 1.77 trillion yuan, setting a new record compared to previous years.
Various types of discount vouchers and eye-catching live sales broadcasts have once again made consumers exclaim about the benefits they gain. On the one hand, this consumption frenzy makes people marvel at the increasingly strong national consumption power. On the other hand, it is also necessary to calmly think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of "Double Twelve", Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the majority of users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and habits, and to reject blind and excessive consumption.
English: According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, the financial consumption performance of residents in our country is relatively good, but there are significant differences in various aspects of financial behavior and skills. It is necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and the "elderly and young" will still be the focus of ongoing financial education; according to the "China Young People's Debt Report" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV Finance, the younger generation has huge consumption potential. Credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, with 86.6% of young people using credit products. Nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole presents a rational consumption trend, it is quite different from the "excessive extravagance" label attached by the outside world. However, some young people do have excessive and trend-following consumption behaviors, resulting in excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even leading to a gradual increase in social problems. Financial enterprises should boldly take on social responsibilities and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Home Credit has been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with high-quality and considerate services, advocating for consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to regulatory calls, taking practical actions to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially the younger generation.
Over the past few years, Jie Xin has been continuously carrying out comprehensive and diversified financial literacy promotion activities targeting the youth group, including college students. By collaborating with top domestic universities and launching innovative practice competitions and other forms, they subtly guide the consumption needs of the younger population in a reasonable manner. This helps them establish rational consumption concepts, plan their consumption needs reasonably, and ultimately accumulate wealth throughout their lives.
English: On the occasion of Double Twelve, Jie Xin reminds all consumer friends to establish a rational consumption awareness and a correct view of money, to resist blind and excessive consumption, to avoid the pitfalls of consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, be sure to plan ahead, act according to your ability, and repay on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have adverse effects on future economic activities such as buying a car or purchasing a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, one should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions have the required qualifications for operation.
In the future, Home Credit will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated and iterated financial products to bring consumers more tailored and diversified services. It will continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge, assist consumers in cultivating rational consumption and moderate borrowing concepts, and be a lifelong trustworthy consumer finance partner for consumers.

Vietnam People's Daily Online - Gulf Cooperation Council Addresses Common Challenges
English: The stopovers of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit to Qatar by Crown Prince Mohammed since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and have had a negative impact on the economy of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
This crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in January 2021, where various Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait, aimed at achieving "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in both countries to Qatar.
The resolution of differences among Gulf Arab countries to restore relations with Qatar stems from the need for unity in the interest of all nations and regional stability, aiming to address common challenges.
During this visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, both sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighboring countries.
The 725-kilometer long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens of both countries and the integration of supply chains.
The Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest 50 billion USD in Oman, and the two countries' enterprises have signed 13 Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) worth 30 billion USD.
English: The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincides with Iran's negotiations with major world powers to save the Iran nuclear agreement, known as the "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action" (JCPOA) - an agreement condemned by the Gulf Arab states for being unable to address the issue of Iranian missiles.
Each Gulf country has always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and considers Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
All Gulf countries believe that, without addressing the Iranian missile issue and taking action to contain Iran's activities in the region, it is flawed.
In the context of the major countries' nuclear negotiations with Iran not meeting the wishes of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia has conducted direct talks with Iran.
Its goal is to curb the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit will be the first summit of the Gulf countries since the resolution of disputes between some members and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate its diplomatic achievements in promoting the restoration of its unity, as well as to propose various measures to ensure full cooperation among its member countries in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf nations.

Boasts the loudest supercar exhaust sound in the new mountain area!
This time, our team brings you this car, which is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the successor to the Murcielago — Aventador LP700-4!
Asking price is nearly two million Malaysian Ringgit, annual road tax is over ten thousand Malaysian Ringgit, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Well, I don't know either, but the data shows that it takes only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h. When my myvi reaches 30km/h, others are already at 100km/h. Yeah.
Low-profile body, flamboyant scissor doors, massive air intakes all around the body, and a fully visible 6.5 V12 engine under the glass, perfectly interpreting Lamborghini's style.
There is no need to say too much about the car models, just Google it yourself. The editor has compiled some explanations that Google might not provide!
English: Getting too much attention, wherever I go everyone is looking, it's quite uncomfortable! (Actually, it's kind of nice)
1km fuel cost is around RM1 (car owners basically don't care)
You need to practice getting in and out of the car, otherwise it might be a bit embarrassing (because you might not be able to get out of the car and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise is too loud, and you will suddenly feel deaf after getting off the car. (But it's still very thrilling)
The car body is too large, and parking it in a regular parking space will be very narrow. I'm afraid of being hit by the door when the car next to it opens!
A bit lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (said by the editor themself, unrelated to the car owner, haha)
Everyone, please don't misunderstand, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot a video for your beloved car, welcome to contact us!

A car accident involving tens of millions of dollars in value!
English: Car enthusiasts are likely familiar with the Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911. The Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, while the price of the Porsche 911 is also in the million-dollar range!
That day, millions of sports cars 911 and tens of millions of supercars Chiron were crashed within a few minutes abroad!
English: Look at the results, it makes sense that it's expensive!
Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua Net
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits formed by a university in the process of long-term development, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of higher education has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science, technology, and society, as well as the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the first modern university in the world, universities have taken on a unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For universities in our country, which rose during the crisis of the nation, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. They advocate the values of "cultivating virtue to benefit the world, and maintaining peace through self-cultivation" and the patriotic responsibility of "promoting education to strengthen the country."
Currently, the trends of informatization and internationalization in higher education are becoming increasingly apparent. The global competition in education, technology, and talent is intensifying. As an important aspect of the "supply side," the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the "Overall Plan for Coordinating and Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines" not only demonstrates China's confidence and determination to advance from a major higher education country to a powerful higher education nation, but also puts forward higher and updated requirements for university development.
How to strive for world-class status in a relatively short period of time, accelerate the establishment of several world-class universities and a batch of world-class disciplines based on the existing gap, and achieve "overtaking on a curve"?
In addition to having firm confidence in goals, paths, and capabilities, universities should also fully leverage three advantages: First, the latecomer advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents, learning from and drawing on the advanced experience of world-class universities, and achieving significant improvements in academic level and education quality; Second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom and connotations of the Chinese civilization accumulated over 5,000 years, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, and using this to gather strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image; Third, the institutional advantage, leveraging the superiority of the socialist country's system, strengthening goal-driven efforts, gathering consensus and collaboration, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate their pursuit of world-class standards.
It is particularly important to realize that building world-class universities cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach; each school must highlight its unique characteristics and features while also leveraging its strengths.
English: The characteristics of running a school should not only have the common Chinese features but also reflect their own unique goal orientation, schooling traditions, and resource endowment.
As for Zhejiang University, we emphasize three distinctive features in our education: Firstly, we focus on fostering our students' entrepreneurship and innovation skills, by constructing an integrated environment combining science, education, and industry, and forming a comprehensive entrepreneurial education ecosystem. Secondly, we highlight the interdisciplinary convergence among subjects, promoting the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, creating an institutional environment for interdisciplinary collaboration, and actively cultivating emerging interdisciplinary subjects and representative accomplishments. Thirdly, we emphasize the uniqueness of our educational system and social services, by engaging in deep international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerating the formation of a comprehensive Zhejiang University industry-university-research collaboration system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always uphold the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the motto "Seeking Truth and Innovation," the common values of "Diligent Learning, Moral Development, Discernment, and Pragmatism," and the shared vision of "Inclusiveness, Cultivating Virtue, Pioneering Knowledge, and Serving the Nation" together constitute the latest expression system of the Zhejiang University spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to persist in the correct direction of running a school, continuously accumulate cultural heights, and gather spiritual strength. It has rich connotations and profound significance.
Among these, "embracing rivers and seas" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodying the idea of "using the talents of the world for our own purposes," and is manifested in drawing on the high-quality educational concepts of world-famous schools; "cultivating true virtues" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and utmost goodness, referring to the fact that universities should not only pursue truth, but also receive the cultivation of moral character and the tempering of personality; "pioneering for the people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes not only the pursuit of new knowledge and innovative research but also the drive for reform, development, and transformation; "building our nation" highlights the spirit of patriotism and dedication, stating that universities should always share the glory and humiliation with the fate of the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is precisely the essence of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
English: "The wise can hear the silent, the insightful can see the invisible."
Chinese universities should further focus on the overall situation of China's unique socialist undertakings, deeply understand the current era's orientation and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate efforts to become world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to the humanistic care and independence, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times, and the national spirit resonate with each other, thereby providing inexhaustible power for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and for the realization of the common ideals of all mankind.

The duration of leave for student entrepreneurs can be extended by 2 to 5 years based on the original academic system, and the time spent on entrepreneurship can be considered as practical education time.

According to the requirements, by 2020, the area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases in colleges and universities should reach over 3,000 square meters for undergraduate schools and over 2,000 square meters for vocational colleges.
The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship credits, and prioritizes supporting students who perform exceptionally well in innovation and entrepreneurship practices to change their majors.
University teachers are required to have at least two months of job training in industry enterprises every two years in order to improve their awareness and ability in innovative entrepreneurship education.

Universities should actively organize students to participate in various innovation and entrepreneurship competitions at all levels, and provide funding support.

English: As NFTs quickly gain popularity, the crypto community has come up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a significant impact in the Southeast Asian region, and some residents who lost job opportunities due to the pandemic began to gain stable income from this game.
English: "Axie Infinity" is a blockchain-based pet development game that incorporates various gameplay elements, including NFTs. It is currently the highest-grossing NFT project, with a total transaction volume exceeding 3 billion US dollars to date.
English: TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily revenue exceeds 8.2 million US dollars, approaching the level of "Honor of Kings".
On August 6th this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users have exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" introduces a new "play-to-earn" model to more people. With the assistance of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer limited to a single role. In addition to gaining enjoyment and financial benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game's ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game developer, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Upon seeing a news article about a friend's stock price, my biggest takeaway is that the choice of a company's track, which refers to the choice of the industry of the investment target, should prioritize industries with large growth potential, at least with a market size of over 100 billion; secondly, choose industries with good future growth prospects, considering those that will reach their optimal growth state in the next 3-5 years; and finally, select industries supported by government policies.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing to do is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022.
Tactics are about "doing the things right," which means doing things correctly.
And the strategy is about "doing the right thing", which means doing the correct thing.
Strategy lies in finding direction, while tactics lie in implementation. Above most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, in addition to thinking about how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), one can consider whether to continue deepening in the current field or extend horizontally to other fields (strategic thinking); for example, beyond improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), one can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); when enhancing event participation (tactical thinking), one can consider how to set the right event KPIs to achieve the correct event goals, such as increasing the participation of target customers, activating high-value dormant customers, and precisely attracting new customers; when improving DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin experienced several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7th, the Central American country of El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as its legal currency, making it the first time that Bitcoin has become the legal currency of a nation or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the launch of a Bitcoin ETF by ProShares for the first time in eight years, which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. This marks the debut of the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF in the U.S. capital market, further expanding exposure to cryptocurrency investments.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot," which improved the anonymity of transactions on the Bitcoin network and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the blocks themselves.

Asian American Groups File Complaint Against Yale and 3 Other Ivy League Schools for Admissions Discrimination - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23rd (Reporter Xu Jianmei) - Over 130 Asian-American groups filed a complaint on May 23 with the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice, protesting against discrimination against Asian applicants in the admissions process of three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which led the appeal, held a press conference in Washington that day.
The group's chairman, Zhao Yukong, said at a press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission criteria for prestigious American universities has doubled. However, the proportion of Asians in these three top American schools has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities, in their so-called "comprehensive consideration" admission process, have "long-term and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants."
Zhao Yukong explained that a 2014 study by Sanders and other scholars showed that among these three colleges, compared to the number of applicants, Asian-Americans had the lowest admission rate among all racial groups.
The data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto racial quota for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope after submitting the appeal, the US Department of Education and Department of Justice can initiate investigations and, after determining the facts, take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions process.
They also expect that the universities being complained about will proactively pay attention to this issue and change their admissions policies towards Asian applicants.
Currently, the 3 universities being complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015, at which time it filed a complaint against Harvard University for admissions discrimination, but the US Department of Education did not accept the case for procedural reasons.
In addition to Chinese American groups participating in the appeal, it also includes Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American, and Pakistani American educational groups from the United States.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory building located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a real estate agency. After visiting the property several times, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory building.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of purchasing the factory building with the family member Lin, who was the property owner. After the negotiation, Mr. Lu transferred 200,000 yuan (approximately 31,000 USD) as a deposit through a bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "Factory Building Deposit Receipt," which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory building, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory building, the deposit will be returned at double the amount to the seller. Both parties agree to sign the factory building purchase contract within a week."
However, subsequently, both parties could not reach a consensus on key contract terms, such as the scope of the factory sale and payment methods, which resulted in the delay of signing the property sales contract.
Considering that both parties failed to reach a consensus on the contract content, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
After a lot of difficulty in finding a suitable house, Mr. Lu had already paid the deposit and prepared the balance payment. He was just one step away from signing the contract, but the seller suddenly decided not to sell. This left Mr. Lu feeling both helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Lin at the Yuyao City People's Court.
The court, after trial, believes that the failure of both parties to sign a formal contract cannot be solely blamed on the defendant. It should be reasonably inferred that the negotiations were unsuccessful; therefore, the case should not apply the rules regarding earnest money. The defendant is not obligated to assume the liability of returning double the earnest money for breach of contract.
After the first trial judgment, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the appellate court upheld the original judgment.
[Lawyer Reminder] In the transaction process, it is necessary to fulfill the duty of due diligence and caution.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to fulfill the duty of due diligence, such as verifying the property owner's information, whether the house is occupied, and other relevant information. It is also important to clearly specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between both parties during the performance of the contract.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese) After the "Democracy Summit" concluded on Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke on Saturday (December 11) and stated that the United States hosting the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" is an act of "drawing lines based on ideology, turning democracy into a tool and weapon, implementing anti-democratic practices under the guise of democracy, inciting division and confrontation, and diverting domestic conflicts."
The Chinese government believes that, "For a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, pushed for 'democratic transformation,' excessively applied unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions,' leading to disastrous consequences."
"Democracy" has long become the "weapon of mass destruction" for the United States to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action of Biden fulfilling his campaign promise.
The two-day conference was held via video, with leaders from 111 countries around the world invited to attend, including Taiwan's leader. However, China and Russia did not receive invitations.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for the problems in its own democracy, saying that the United States is not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of doubt internationally and within the United States, such as criticisms of the invitations to some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, like those from the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, among others. Some people suspect that the true intentions of the Biden administration in organizing this summit are not for democracy, but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly-appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the virtual Democracy Summit.
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday, "Today's American democracy is in a sick state, with money politics, identity politics, political party rivalry, political polarization, social division, racial conflict, and wealth inequality becoming increasingly intense." The democracy in the United States is built on a foundation of capitalism, and it is a "rich man's game."
U.S. President Biden said in his speech, "As government leaders, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fences of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, better resist the buffering and impact forces of authoritarianism, as well as those who nakedly pursue power before the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not taken for granted, "We must constantly renew it among every generation, in my opinion, this is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said, "At a time when global democracy and human rights are facing persistent and worrying challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The United States has pledged to launch a year-long initiative following this Democracy Summit, including a $424.4 million proposal to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support to independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the in-person Democracy Summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let all our countries implement our commitments and report the progress we have made next year."
Alright, I'm just afraid that he might have sent it to the wrong address.

Tasty flavor, good meat, enthusiastic service
It's been a long time since I've been to Ri Chang. The fruit punch is still as delicious as ever, with genuine and abundant ingredients. It's my first time ordering BBQ pork buns, and they have the soft and fluffy southern-style taste that I love!
The claypot rice has just the right level of moisture, and the portion is very generous. The signature foil-wrapped chicken wings are as good as always, and the complimentary soup is not bad either. The Chinese broccoli is also handled quite well...
Great taste, warm service, and good quality meat.
Ri Chang Old Store - A popular spot on the internet many years ago, located in Dongdan Xiaolou with wooden floors.
At the entrance, there's always a long wait to eat the clay pot rice, and the clay pots of the clay pot rice are already cracked...
It has been several years since I last went to eat at Ri Chang, and the rise of various small Cantonese cuisine shops has dispersed the customer flow.
It's rare to find seats available as soon as you arrive at the restaurant. The quality of the dishes is impeccable, as always.
English: Great taste, good meat, and awesome staple food
Ri Chang Takeaway.
Rice meal: This time, the dishes were slightly disappointing.
Three Cups Chicken: The side dishes are a bit too much, and the chicken is slightly less.
The main flavor of this dish is a bit off, the base taste is not salty enough, which emphasizes the sweetness. Everyone can imagine the combination of sweet with various spices and side dishes…
What is the drinking method for Red Label Whisky?
Everyone has different hobbies; some people like collecting, some people enjoy gourmet food, and of course, some people like tasting wine. Red Label Whisky is currently one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in various countries, and Red Label Whisky has even won the gold medal in the International Spirits Competition.
Every bottle of red label whiskey has a distinctive taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, it would be a waste of its mellow aroma.
So, how to drink the red label whiskey?
English: Let me give you all a brief introduction.
Red Label Whiskey Drinking Method:
English: The Johnnie Walker Red Label whiskey is blended from about 35 types of Scotch whiskey, featuring a rich fragrance and traditional Scotch whiskey characteristics. The strong aroma carries sweet and smoky notes.
The entrance is rich and refreshing, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor.
The wine can be consumed directly with ice, or mixed with your favorite drink.
English: As Red Label Whiskey enters the domestic market, in order to cater to the taste of the locals, Red Label Whiskey combined with cola, Sprite or other carbonated beverages like Schweppes has become an enduring and fashionable trend.
These sweet drinks, besides neutralizing the sour taste, can visually bring pleasure to people. When added to beverages, they can dilute the alcohol taste and change the mouthfeel.
Red Label Whisky + sliced lemon + cube sugar (granulated sugar is also fine) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink.
The authentic taste of Hongfangwei is somewhat sour, but adding sugar can neutralize the acidity, and lemon will bring a refreshing aroma to the wine. Of course, the sweet and sour balance can be adjusted according to individual taste preferences.
The above three methods are the best ways to drink Red Label whiskey. Everyone can use them as a reference and give it a try. I hope this introduction from the editor can help everyone.
Education Thoughts: How University Exams Can Allow Both "Top Students" and "Poor Students" to Find Their Place - Xinhua News Agency
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University write a letter to the school leaders, expressing their confusion about university exams and suggesting to increase the exam difficulty, change the exam question types, and let the exams truly reflect the actual level of students.
Indeed, for a long time, university exams have been a "hot topic."
In the university campus, students come from all corners of the world with varying levels of ability and different degrees of learning, resulting in a diverse range of learning situations.
For a group with such diverse characteristics, it is inevitable to have different feelings while conducting evaluations.
Of course, if the exam questions are of a single type, have a high repetition rate, and are overly simple, it will inevitably lead to a completely different feeling.
Students who do not put in effort may be able to pass by focusing intensely right before the exam. If they consider other methods, it's possible to achieve twice the results with half the effort.
In this way, a "weird situation" arises where a "poor student" who doesn't usually put in effort can pass and even get high scores; while a "top student" who never misses class, has good homework and notes, doesn't score much higher in exams.
In this regard, the concerns raised by the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University regarding issues in university exams are not unfounded. It is likely that this situation is not unique to Lanzhou Jiaotong University alone.
From this perspective, we should give a thumbs up to these 3 students who directly express their thoughts in writing.
In fact, those who have attended college are well aware that last-minute exam preparation, trying various ways to "extract" exam questions from teachers, striving to narrow down the exam scope, and seeking "key tutoring" before the exam are not uncommon phenomena. Even instances of cheating with cheat sheets during the exam and pleading for teachers' leniency after the exam are not unheard of.
In the author's view, as a teaching quality assessment orientation, measuring whether a university examination is qualified or not depends more on the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as the scientific proposition based on this foundation.
Upon entering the undergraduate stage in university, majors begin to be subdivided, and many specialized courses mainly focus on basic knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether to fully grasp the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content to be tested in university exams.
The undergraduate knowledge is mainly based on the basic theories and common sense of the discipline. In terms of knowledge points, the room for change is not large, and it is basically fixed.
As the teacher said, "The basic knowledge of university mathematics learned 20 years ago is still being studied today and remains a focus."
Although the knowledge points remain basically unchanged, it does not mean that the exam question types are single and the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, exams usually involve the formation of a question-setting group, which is then coordinated by senior teachers of the subject to create the test paper. The grading of exams is also carried out by all the teachers responsible for that subject, which can effectively overcome the issue of repeated questions to a certain extent.
To create a set of exam questions that conform to the practical aspects of teaching and learning, we need to take into account the overall situation of the students' learning and distribute the difficulty of the questions following a normal distribution. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and thoroughly analyze the students' learning levels to dynamically adjust the difficulty and types of questions in the exams. This approach not only highlights the examination of basic knowledge but also takes into account the assessment of abilities, while simultaneously incorporating innovative designs for the question types.
Exams are the baton of university education. Depending on the type of exam, students will have corresponding preparation plans. Over time, this will affect the effectiveness of university education.
For the suggestion letter from students, Lanzhou Jiaotong University has attached great importance to it and has implemented rectification plans throughout the school.
English: It is required that each teaching unit organizes teachers to carry out discussions and self-inspection of the final exams in comparison with the course content, formulates examination paper questions and related systems, while strengthening the supervision and inspection of examination paper question setting and review processes. Furthermore, refine the assessment of scores and enhance the comprehensive assessment of each aspect of course teaching.
Addressing the issues of uniformity in exam question types and repetition in topics from a systematic perspective is a topic that university examination administration needs to face. Of course, corresponding systems need to be introduced, but the key lies in daily efforts. Teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only thoroughly understanding the teaching content but also thoroughly understanding the students' learning situations. By having a thorough understanding of both aspects, teaching and learning can be better connected, forming a positive interaction. Exams will become more in line with practicality, allowing both top-performing students and underachieving students to find their place.

Jin Furen Wedding Photography (South Street Branch) currently has no other branches.
Before taking photos, we didn't schedule our time properly and changed the time twice. Consultant Lanlan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, they chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos.
Lady Jin's staff, whether they are consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are all highly praised.
That was the first time I had ever put on makeup formally in my life. Wow, I couldn't believe that one day I would become so good-looking, haha.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry, I can't remember her name) are super patient when it comes to makeup, and their makeup looks very natural.
The outdoor scenes were shot at Jiangwan City, and luckily the weather was nice that day, so we didn't feel too cold. During the photoshoot, the makeup artist kept an eye on our clothes and headwear, and would immediately help us fix anything that was slightly off.
The photographer was also very humorous, and we felt happy throughout the whole day of taking pictures.
When choosing photos, because we saw so many cases online, we didn't want to let the customers delete too many photos. But when we were selecting photos, we really didn't have any intention of adding more photos. We just took the 24 photos included in the package, without adding any additional ones. (I heard that my cousin, who took her wedding photos around the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to her over 7,000 RMB package, which shocked me at that time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many)
Today, the photos were fixed, Lan Lan sent them to me, and I saw two that I didn't think were very good, so they immediately helped me fix them again.
After looking at the past photos of my sister and comparing them, I feel really satisfied with our photos. They are simple and refreshing, exactly the style I want.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Madame Jin for wedding photos!
Set Price: 3999 RMB
Mrs. Jin is grateful for your sincere wishes, and she wishes you happiness, fulfillment, and a bright future!
How much does this set cost?
What conditions must be met in order to use that $32?
That's good, no need to refund then.
Your rider said they couldn't find it.
Cannot find
But I can't understand the English he's speaking.

English: 3,200 newborn babies in Sabah have no birth certificates due to a shortage of special anti-counterfeit paper
(Ya Bi, 11th news) Sabah National Registration Bureau stated, due to the depletion of the special anti-counterfeit paper stock, they have been unable to issue birth certificates for newborns since early October. Up to now, the cumulative number of affected individuals has reached 3,200.
However, the director of the bureau, Ke Lu A Mi Nu Si, assures that all the information of the babies who have applied for birth certificates has been recorded in the system, and the anti-counterfeit papers will be reissued when they arrive next week.
He explained at the press conference the report by an online media outlet pointing out the issue of paper printing in Sabah for a duration of 10 months.
He said, the related issue emerged 2 months ago, and Sarawak also faced the same problem.
One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers producing the special anti-counterfeiting paper have been affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed arrival in our country.
He explained that the security paper used for Sabah birth certificates is different from other regions, so they cannot borrow stock from other states.
Kailu Aminu revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper has already arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and was then handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
The department will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods and immediately proceed with the final stage of printing upon returning to Sabah. It is estimated that it will take an additional 2 working days (December 20th) for the items to be delivered to the applicants.
"We will notify the applicants to go to the local branches for collecting their birth registration papers."
He added that a total of 24,801 birth certificates have been issued in Sabah so far this year.
Waiting from a little after 7 o'clock until now.
English: So, is it almost there?
I am referring to food.
I am waiting again across from #PRS_ORG#.
Alright, thank you, because the restaurant said it is ready.

Education Information: Beijing Reduces the Proportion of Students with Special Talents in Junior High School Admissions in 2016 - Xinhua News Agency
On the 21st and 22nd, the examination of junior high school students with special talents in Beijing was organized and implemented by each district's education committee.
This year, the enrollment ratio of students with special talents in various districts of Beijing has been reduced, making the competition for these talented students even more intense.
Taking Dongcheng District as an example, this year the proportion of primary school students transitioning to junior high school with special talents in the district will not exceed 5% of the total enrollment plan, with a planned enrollment of 380 students, and the proportion attending school will not exceed 10% of the school's enrollment plan.
English: All students with sports, art, or technology expertise who have registered online are eligible to participate in the special talents admissions examination.
To make it convenient for students to take exams nearby, Dongcheng District continues the examination arrangement method of last year, setting up 1-2 examination locations in each school district, with a total of 13 examination locations.
Test sites are divided into examination halls according to test areas and separated into time slots by hours. On the day of the examination, students will enter the test site according to the time slot and take the examination in different examination halls within the test area.

Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee Chairman: Firmly believe that China has the ability to hold a successful Winter Olympics during special times - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Sarajevo, December 11th - The Chairman of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesich, recently said that Bosnia is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and firmly believes that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics during this special period.
Recently, Chinese Ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina Ji Ping met with the President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesic, at the Sarajevo Olympic Center.
During the meeting, Kvesic spoke highly of the relations between Bosnia and China, stating that he had visited China during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics and was deeply impressed by the outstanding organization work of the Chinese side. He firmly believes that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics during these special times. Bosnia is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics, and the Bosnian Olympic Committee is actively organizing its participation. Bosnia hopes that this occasion will serve as an opportunity to engage in more extensive exchanges and cooperation with China in the field of sports.
Ji Ping said that China and Poland have a special "Olympic bond."
In 1984, the Sarajevo Winter Olympics were successfully held here. In another two months, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also kick off, presenting a simple, safe, and wonderful event to the world.
Looking forward to the deepening of exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in the preparation of winter sports events and athlete training, the Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue to play a bridging role, taking the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity to promote the continuous deepening of cultural exchanges between the two countries and let the people of both countries "move together towards the future". We also wish Bosnian and Herzegovinian athletes good results in Beijing.
Before the meeting, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held the "10th Annual Best Athlete" award ceremony, with Ji Ping as the specially invited guest presenting the award for the best young athlete in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
At the event venue, promotional videos of the Beijing Winter Olympics are played on a loop.

English: 48-hour nucleic acid test negative, set up "buffer zone", State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a document requesting to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic in port cities - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) - The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of COVID-19 in port cities, requiring that individuals who have recently left land border port cities (excluding those connected with Hong Kong and Macau ports) must hold a nucleic acid test negative certificate within 48 hours. People going to land border port cities must undergo at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the day when each province, autonomous region, and municipality determines the scope of port cities and announces it, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also suggests that conditionally qualified port cities can explore setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
English: A relevant official from the National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau explains that for some border cities, cross-border trade is a major economic pillar, and there is frequent interaction between both sides of the border residents.
Implement differentiated management policies by region, changing from a single defense line to a double defense line, in the hope of achieving a proactive approach, reducing the risk of the epidemic spillover, and maximizing the effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with minimal social impact and the lowest social cost.
In recent times, there have been several local cluster outbreaks in our country, all of which were caused by imported cases from abroad through port cities.
The above notice points out that this exposes some issues such as untimely monitoring and early warning of local epidemics, incomplete closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, the procedural nature of regular nucleic acid tests, insufficient disinfection at various stages of cold chain products, the irregular management of centralized quarantine venues, and inaccurate scientific emergency responses to epidemics.
The notice requires that efforts be made in 9 aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in border cities, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures. The goal is to accelerate the improvement of prevention and control shortcomings in border cities, maintain strict and scientifically precise control measures, and weave a strong line of defense against imported cases.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should carry out the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood protection simultaneously, announce and ensure smooth access to the people's livelihood protection hotline, regularly check for potential problems in the supply and price of basic living materials, and promptly address and proactively respond to the prominent issues raised by the public.
According to the notice, the port cities mentioned include open land, water, and air ports located in counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (prefectures, states, leagues), and municipalities directly under the jurisdiction of the central government. The specific scope is determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government) based on the needs of epidemic prevention and control and is announced in a timely manner.

Investigative video reveals the truth about the 20 years of bloodthirsty killings by the US military - Xinhua News
English: (Video source: YouTube)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machine" on the oil pipeline platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the war in Afghanistan in the name of "counter-terrorism," forcibly exporting American-style democracy through war. For 20 years, the US has waged war, been bloodthirsty, killed innocents wantonly, and committed various crimes against humanity.
Abusing drone strikes on hospitals, schools, and other civilian areas, distorting human nature, and forming assassination squads.
Over the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military establishes "black prisons" to impose various tortures and personal humiliations on "suspects."
One after another, crimes against humanity stir up more hatred among Afghans.
As the video states, the American "anti-terrorism" war is "the more you fight, the more terrified."
War has not brought peace, democracy, or prosperity and hope to the Afghan people; all it has brought is a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video, let's expose the truth of America's bloody killings under the guise of "counter-terrorism" together, and pierce through the hypocrisy of American democracy!
English: I accidentally came across the following article, which discusses from a commercial perspective and the perspective of the preservation period why this customer wants a bonded warehouse logistics company to help with canning. Although canning is considered deep processing and not within the scope of bonded logistics companies, this text below may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I visited many milk powder factories and came into contact with numerous milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged and canned milk powder are exactly the same, with no difference at all.
So everyone must be wondering: Why is the shelf life of bagged products one year, while the shelf life of canned products is two years or longer?
Or another question: Why is there such a big price difference between bulk and bagged products?
In fact, starting from this point, many consumers, or mothers, believe that the quality will be much better due to the different raw materials used.
In fact, the raw materials are the same; it's just that people think the more expensive ones are better.
There are also consumers who, with this mindset, try the food and still claim that the taste or texture of the imitation product is just not the same!
English: Now, let me first explain to everyone the reason for being expensive, where is the expensive part?
Why is there such a big price difference when their raw materials are the same?
English: Many manufacturers take into consideration that if the price of bagged products is set too high, consumers will find it difficult to accept. This means that the manufacturers' profits will be very low, or even non-existent. In that case, how can the manufacturers survive?
English: Therefore, they have had a significant increase in the pricing of the equipment to ensure their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote the listening style, rather than the bag style.
Moreover, you think about the manufacturers that spend tens of millions or even billions on advertising fees every year. Where does this cost come from?
As everyone can imagine.
So, with the development of society, the market promotion costs, such as: shopping mall promoters, shopping mall display expenses, product gift expenses, advertising expenses, etc. are also constantly increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and they are audio devices; their prices are also continuously rising. Actually, these new products are launched in response to the increasing market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, and in fact, the cost increase of their raw materials will not exceed 3 to 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their own products, use unscrupulous means and collaborate with doctors in hospitals. They enlist the doctors' assistance in product promotion, allowing them to earn profits ranging from 30 to 80 RMB per sale.
English: In fact, the relevant Chinese laws absolutely do not allow such methods of operation, and this practice is harming consumers.
I suggest that everyone buys bagged milk powder and transfers it into a container at home. This can save costs while increasing the preservation and sealing of the milk powder, without any impact on the children.
Moreover, everyone should not assume that the shelf life of canned products is longer than that of bagged products. After opening, the shelf life of both canned and bagged products is the same. It's just that bagged products are not easy to store after opening and are prone to dampness and deterioration.
The food delivery was late, and the food has become cold. After cooling down, it became dry and hard, making it completely inedible.
Moreover, the soup also spilled out.
Cancel it immediately, the stuff he sent from #PRS_ORG# must have gone cold by now.
I didn't take it!
English: #NAME# says none of you went to get it
We made a phone call.
If you don't refund me, I will call the police.
I have used #PRS_ORG# multiple times, but today's experience was the worst.
Absolutely unacceptable
Alright, can do.
But also remind the restaurant and the rider
Avoid it happening again next time
I want to know the exact delivery time.
That time keeps getting delayed
I don't know how long I have to wait.
If the order is cancelled, can the money be refunded?
How can I pay the service fee to the rider?
Over an hour ago, it was confirmed that there is a rider.
Unwilling to wait any longer
Do not scare people at the starting line - Xinhua News Network
English: While visiting a book fair, one can often feel the popularity of success-oriented books.
Today's success-oriented books often promote the "best principle" - that is, first assuming or implying that you can "achieve" something, and then telling you what it is that you need to achieve.
In other words, it skipped over the "how to achieve it" part, which is actually the most important and fundamental aspect.
Precisely because of this, these books share a common characteristic - either do your best all at once, or simply don't do anything at all; either it's 100 or it's 0; either you climb Mount Tai, or you simply stay where you are.
This "best principle" makes anyone who sees it admit that it is "unparalleled in correctness", but 99% of people will be scared away before the starting line.
English: Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, start anew, and make a 180-degree turn," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who are sticking to conventions, following old routines, and refusing to change, shouting "you need to transform" in their ears is undoubtedly self-deception and a futile gesture, like playing the lute to a cow.
The vast majority of people tend to hesitate when faced with the word "change", holding back and finding it difficult to make a decision; or they may make the determination to change on impulse and bravely take the first step, but often, this good situation does not last long, and they cannot persist for much longer before failing to maintain the momentum, making it difficult to sustain.
English: Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk, "Starting From Tomorrow," is the most vivid representation of this "universal human nature" classic.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limits of ordinary people's abilities, causing the vast majority of people to "sigh at the door."
Perhaps, the "second best principle" is a way that might lead more ordinary people onto the path of relative success.
The core of the "next best principle" lies in "lowering the threshold" - it advocates a theory of "accumulating small victories for a big victory." That is, if you can't achieve 100, it's okay to only achieve 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, it's fine to just climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that's still better than staying in place.
In conclusion, doing something is always better than doing nothing.
Due to the significant reduction in the threshold, the possibility for ordinary people to persist has increased, and as long as one persists in anything, the probability of success will also increase.
The path to success by following the "next best principle" is just slightly longer.
In summary, although the "best principle" claims to make everyone successful on the surface, in reality, it only motivates a few. The "second-best principle," however, can effectively encourage more people and benefit as many as possible.

Qinghai Lake Naked Carp Resources Increase by 0.71 Ten Thousand Tons This Year - Xinhuanet
English: Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) - Reporters learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 thousand tons this year compared to last year, reaching 108.5 thousand tons. Compared with the early stage of protection in 2002, the total growth has increased by more than 40 times.
English: Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "Huang Fish", is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as large-scale human hunting, the degradation of the naked carp's breeding environment, and other factors, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake Naked Carp was listed as an endangered species in the China Species Red List.
English: Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure and fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, collective, or individual from fishing naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the major rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and banning the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, by means of artificial propagation and release, cleaning the main rivers flowing into Qinghai Lake, and designing scientifically sound "fish passageways", the protection efforts for Qinghai Lake Naked Carp resources continue to increase, leading to a yearly growth in its reserves.
English: Yang Lin, deputy director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million artificially bred and released naked carp have been introduced into Qinghai Lake, contributing to over 23% of the restoration of the naked carp resources in the lake.
English: The Three Rivers Source area in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake serves as a natural barrier and ecological functional area to control the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment and aquatic wildlife in the Sanjiangyuan area and Qinghai Lake, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued fishing ban notices for the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake key waters since this year, building a comprehensive fishing ban management system for "one river, one river, and one lake."
I used the #PRS_ORG# RED credit card to order food for more than $180.

But it's not regular enough to predict precisely, with a tolerance of about a week, requiring advance preparation. Sometimes, if you're unlucky, things can go wrong (suddenly moving up by several days).
English: The duration, blood volume, and severity of menstrual pain vary from person to person. Some people experience it for three days, while others for a week; some have light bleeding, while others have heavy bleeding; some have no noticeable reactions, while others experience pain so severe that they need to be taken away by an ambulance. Menstrual pain can change over time; not having pain in the past does not mean one will never experience pain.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, with bleeding occurring 24 hours a day for several days from the beginning to the end. The only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to absorb the blood and prevent it from flowing onto clothes or chairs.
Menstrual pain is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen promptly when the menstrual period just begins and before the pain starts can effectively relieve the pain for that month. However, taking it after the pain has already started is not very useful.
English: Before menstruation, due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandin, it is easy to have diarrhea.
English: If it's around the expected time of the cycle and you suddenly have diarrhea for no apparent reason, your period will likely arrive within two days.
Sanitary napkins should be changed every two to three hours, otherwise bacteria may breed easily. Excluding sleep time, the worst-case scenario is changing 6 times a day, 7 days a month, which amounts to 42 pads. If you include extra pads prepared in advance, there might be a total of 50 pads. It's definitely not the case that you only need one pad per month.
(Here's a revision: sanitary tampons do not need to be changed frequently, changing them every five or six hours should be enough, and the longest should be eight hours)
During menstruation, hormonal fluctuations may cause irritability, and emotional instability may also occur during ovulation due to changes in hormones in the body. It's quite unfortunate, as the body seems to be tripping us up.
English: However, official crime rate data shows that women have high emotional control and do not use emotional issues as an excuse.
The flow is not just blood, but also contains shed uterine lining.
After the menstruation, the uterine lining is at its thinnest, and then it gradually thickens. You can think of the uterus like a house, where every month the house (the lining) is built in preparation to receive a guest. If the guest doesn't come, the house is dismantled (shed during menstruation) and a new house will be built the following month. This cycle repeats itself.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For several decades, there is continuous bleeding for a few days every month, 24 hours a day, and it can also cause abdominal and lower back pain. Who would want that?
However, a person is born because his or her mother has experienced menstruation. Menstruation is a preparation for your first arrival in this world, where you will live for 10 months. Everyone should be grateful for their mother's regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things concerning women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women to believe that they were dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was just the way it was, but times have changed.
If anyone feels that menstruation is disgusting, and that the female body's preparation for nurturing life is disgusting, they shouldn't say it in public. Girls, stand up, don't think like this anymore. Men who have never experienced it and never will, and don't really understand it, don't be so ungrateful and ignorant. How can you have the audacity to face your own mother with such an attitude, and how can you even think of having your own child?
Finally, sisters, try the sanitary tampons, they are really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice Festival, sending the wrong gift can be quite disappointing.
English: Need to order an extra meal for the child to eat.
English: Hope the shop takes time out of its busy schedule to check the products.
Does numbness in feet when soaking in a foot bath indicate an electric leakage?
English: Choosing the right foot bath tub can have great foot therapy health benefits. Today, Guomei's editor will address this issue, hoping to be helpful to friends.
English: As people's health awareness is growing stronger, footbaths are becoming more and more popular among consumers. A wide variety of products with different levels of quality have emerged in the market, ranging from over a hundred yuan to thousands of yuan. This provides consumers with a vast range of options to choose from.
On the surface of relevant data, compared to traditional household appliances, the sales of health care appliances such as foot baths are booming. However, there are no specific industry standards for foot baths, which leads to certain safety risks.
Soaking your feet in electrified water is really too dangerous!
Mr. Li told the reporter that recently, he bought a foot bath tub as a birthday gift for his father. However, his father felt numbness on the soles of his feet while soaking them.
English: At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath tub. He didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation on the soles of his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen, and surprisingly it lit up. Mr. Li was amazed to find that the water in the foot bath tub was actually electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was pretty good. Although the foot bath was returned, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
English: Because he found that there are no clear and detailed industry regulations regarding the highest temperature setting, the target population, and the harmless materials used for this popular foot bath basin that has been popular for a long time.
English: In general, foot bath tubs do not have electrical problems, but it cannot be ruled out that a few products may not have been strictly checked during manufacturing.
Therefore, choose a split-type foot bath tub when purchasing.
Water and electricity separation, no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can also randomly use an electric pen to test.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Hua Sheng Online
Hunan Daily News, December 10th (All-Media Reporter Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, Correspondent Liu Xiaoling, Photographer Li Jian) - This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Hua Hong Tea Promotion Conference were held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the sprint towards the 100 billion tea industry target.
Vice Director of the All-China Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Council Hou Shunli and Deputy Director of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee Ye Hongzhuan attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, grandly introduced at the opening ceremony: The origin of lake red is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea injects new vitality into the "colorful Hunan tea."
In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoting the construction of the 100-billion-yuan Hunan tea industry and forming the development pattern of "Three Hunan, Four Waters, and Five-color Tea."
In the province's tea industry, innovation is being intensified, with major tea categories such as green tea, black tea, and red tea taking turns to show strength. The main tea-producing areas are promoting the integration of tea and tourism, driving the majority of tea farmers to increase their income.
The wheel of fortune turns, and black tea regains its strength.
English: Experts in the provincial tea industry say that after harvesting green tea, they harvest red and black tea, allowing tea farmers to have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens to increase steadily.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises with the rights to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xinhua happily held up the "Source of Hunan Red" plaque.
At the Xinhua black tea exhibition hall, a Fujian tea merchant took a fancy to a high mountain tea called "Ice Spring" and placed an order on the spot.
English: Wang Zhun, Secretary General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, happily said that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the perspective of the tea expo, there are many highlights.
The new transformation of black tea adds a touch of red, incorporating the essence of tea culture, enjoying high popularity and booming transactions, and the Hunan tea industry welcomes a new spring.
English: So, if these foods are not hot, can they be canceled?
I don't want it anymore. Due to the inability to park downstairs, he couldn't deliver it.
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be directly answered through perception, using rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.

English: #NUMBER# Yuan received, it is the missing food delivery.
English: Yang Xing Che, originally named Jiang Bo, was born in the Year of the Sheep and the month of the Sheep. He walks on the grass, and finds his place, hence the name "Yang Xing Che." He is also known as "Sheep Uncle."
Due to publishing the "Exotic Code" series including "Thailand Tales of the Exotic", "India Tales of the Exotic", "Japan Tales of the Exotic", "Korea Tales of the Exotic" and other works, he is known as a "mystery genius" in the industry and describes himself as "good at talking nonsense with a serious face."
"Under the Lamp is Dark," also known as "Strange Tales from China," is a brand-new work by the "Mystery and Weird Talent" Yang Xingchi, which takes you deep into the essence of Chinese folklore. What kind of poignant and moving love-hate stories lie behind those legends that have been passed down to this day?
"The Different Path Travelers" Nan Xiaolou and Yue Wuhua embark on yet another dangerous adventure, and their true identities are about to be revealed.
"Mystery Genius" Yang Xingtu's hair turned white from hard work, dedicating millions of best-selling books!
Authentic "Chinese Anecdotes," a brand-new work following "Exotic Codes," by the same author and featuring the same protagonist, continues the unfinished stories of "Thai Anecdotes" and "Indian Anecdotes"!
English: You gave one less item, even a McChicken sauce costs money.
Order food delivery from the restaurant.
I just don't want to go downstairs to buy things, that's why I spend so much money on takeout.
Ding Zilin: To My Friend.
I wholeheartedly thank all friends for their humanitarian assistance during the 30 long years after the tragic death of our loved ones, especially since I personally appealed for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994. The assistance has never been interrupted up to now.
Nowadays, the majority of the victims' elderly parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up, started families, and found employment.
It is your righteous act that has helped our afflicted families through the most difficult moments.
Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is wreaking havoc worldwide, and the majority of donors have already reached retirement age.
Therefore, I earnestly request you to suspend the humanitarian donations to our suffering group - the Tiananmen Mothers, as this humanitarian assistance activity should have already been brought to a perfect end.
I will always cherish your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be recorded in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me, my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
English: Tao Yean: Please allow me to take this opportunity to provide a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance by the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of carrying out humanitarian assistance, the All-America Students Association and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the implementers of the projects often overlap.
(Apple Daily Photo: The Tiananmen Mothers website is managed by Tao Ye.) pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
Relief funds often cannot be smoothly delivered into the hands of the families of the June 4th incident.
In 1994, under the recommendation of Teacher Ding, a dedicated team was established by "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund", which was implemented for 11 years. In 2009, after all the June 4th orphans had graduated from university, MCDF subsequently established the "June 4th Impoverished Elderly Relief Fund" and has been implementing it to this day.
The funding for these projects mainly comes from campus and social donations during the June 4th incident, generous contributions from individuals, and is supported by the Brother Universities Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
English: Not until last year, after 31 years, did the families of the Tiananmen Square incident victims finally receive a portion of the donations raised in Hong Kong under the name of "June 4th".
During this period, "China Human Rights" is also independently carrying out their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding called for a halt to the donations for June 4th, considering the donors. Indeed, most of us are retired elderly people and our income is not as abundant as it was before retirement. Therefore, we would like to express our gratitude for Mr. Ding's letter "To Friends".
We will respect the decision of the bereaved families, terminate this project within two years, and resume it immediately when needed.
For those who have persisted in generously donating and taking risks to deliver humanitarian aid for many years, I would like to express my gratitude and respect to these chivalrous and righteous people.

[Effect] Photo effect: Took pictures of two outfits, overall it's not bad, I like this set of pictures more.
[Service] Service details: Due to pregnancy, I felt a little uncomfortable while putting on makeup. The makeup artist and staff were very considerate, allowing me to rest for a while and constantly providing me with hot water to drink.
Set price: 1000 yuan
English: Thank you for the rabbit's review. I originally said that rejecting the ancient style is not suitable for the ancient style. I never thought the finished product would be so beautiful.
English: Thank you for Dandan's recognition. Your satisfaction can keep us energized to move forward, and we will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really amazing. Highly recommend all friends to come!
English: Regardless of reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography, and post-production, everything is impeccable.
The makeup artist is particularly meticulous and will match a makeup look suitable for your style. They also use top-tier, well-known brands for their cosmetics.
English: As for Teacher Tian Liang, there is no need to mention it; his photography skills are extremely professional.
The entire studio has a strong artistic atmosphere, and there are also two kittens to keep you company and play with.
We work in Beijing, and the better photography studios in Beijing require a six-month advance reservation. Some colleagues have had their photos taken here, and after reviewing the results, they feel it's just so-so.
Specially sought out this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
English: Our facial expression management is relatively poor, and we feel that this is also a shortcoming of most people. Photographer Liang Ge can capture and record natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production designer, a well-equipped team.
After the film comes out, both we and the people around us never stop praising it.
English: Already recommended it to my best friend, and she also felt overjoyed after just watching the rough cut.

Now the restaurant staff is calling me.
A programming beginner who wants to share their personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, it might be a good idea to choose a place for training. However, if you do not have any thoughts about entering this field, it is better to self-study. After all, training can be very expensive, and it takes 6 months to complete the course.
But if you're planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-discipline, training is an even better option.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose self-study, but it might be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important matter.
First of all, we need to look at the faculty strength of this institution. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, the training institution would be meaningless. Of course, the faculty strength of some newly established training institutions is not particularly strong.
Next, investigate the training institution before making a choice, and it is best to inquire about the students that have graduated from this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know how good it is, and whether the courses offered are good or not.
Hello, actually I don't know how to answer your question because you didn't provide any information about your personal situation, and learning has a lot to do with one's individual circumstances.
For example, factors such as your profession, age, languages you want to learn, and even the city you are in, all of these are related to the industry you are studying or want to work in.
If you are a student who has not yet graduated, or a graduate from a computer major, then I personally suggest self-study if you have enough time, as this is the most efficient and low-cost method. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are actually quite good, but the cost of learning is high and you need to invest a relatively long time. Basically, concentrated training is needed for 3-6 months.
English: However, if it's the situations I mentioned, self-learning can be very convenient. There are many free learning resources online nowadays, or you can find numerous training resources on Bilibili. If you don't know how to locate resources, you can also contact me through my profile to get free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major but can afford a certain amount of money and time for learning, it is recommended to study at a training institution. This way, learning will not be too difficult, the teachers explain things in detail, and there are people specifically to answer any questions. In addition, it provides help in learning planning and supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements and have internal referral quotas. After completing the course, they recommend students to companies, which can save a lot of effort in the later interview process when looking for a job.
That's all for my opinions. As I mentioned earlier, I couldn't provide much detail because I don't fully understand your situation. If you have any other questions or need additional consultation, please feel free to contact me for further communication.
I said I'd arrive before 1 o'clock, I can see it all in the App.
English: What does it mean
English: I haven't finished speaking yet, what are you doing?
I undertake various tasks, including installation, cleaning, and maintenance of wall-hanging boilers, water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stove tops, range hoods, lighting installation, glass cleaning, professional seam beautification, and housekeeping services.
English: Grateful to those who silently support me, striving for a better life. Life is tiring but we must keep going.
Life will not disappoint those who strive, if you like me, please follow me, and thank you to those who silently give me likes.
English: Life is like this, others only see the results, we alone support the process. In the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong and keep going. We can look back on the road we've traveled but we cannot go back...
Cleaning is a job and a responsibility. Life becomes beautiful because of the service, and the service becomes splendid because of the care we put in it.
In cleaning, even though we do the dirtiest work, we will clean every corner of our customers' homes with the utmost dedication. Seeing the satisfied smiles and thumbs-up from our customers makes all the fatigue worth it, as hard work always pays off!
My daily work
English: Your request, my service.
Serve with dedication, clean with dedication, retain the beauty.
The details you care about, Fenggui Housekeeping helps you achieve "cleanliness" to the best of our ability, serving your beloved home.
Ensure cleanliness for ten thousand families, establish a monument for good housekeeping, provide accurate services, and bring cleanliness to every home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although crystal lamps are gorgeous, they will become dull and lackluster if not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can they shine brilliantly, and so it is with life.
Only by working hard can we achieve success, by being meticulous can we create refinement. In doing beautiful seams, we are serious.
Give me a chance, and I will definitely satisfy you. Quality speaks for itself because professionalism is worth trusting. Your recognition is my greatest motivation!
Nowadays, it's not easy to do any job in various industries!
But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, enough persistence, and enough effort, I will be better than others, at least better than just sitting and complaining!
A day's plan starts in the morning, all the beauty begins in the early morning. I hope you embark with happiness, good luck, health, and satisfaction as you start a new day, maintaining a good mood throughout the day. Good morning!
When we are young, happiness is a thing; if you have it, you're happy. As we grow up, happiness becomes a goal; if you achieve it, you're happy. After reaching maturity, we realize that happiness is actually a state of mind; if you understand it, you're happy.
Be the most authentic and kindest version of yourself, follow your heart, and live a life without regrets; life is a journey, walk your own path; treasure two things in life: good health and a good mood, live a beautiful life until old age!
In every stage of life, we will encounter different challenges.
In many cases, it is not your ability but the courage to face things positively that binds you.
Since it is impossible to avoid, it's better to face it calmly.
The more you fear, the more you will be defeated by difficulties; if you face the challenges head-on, the problems will eventually be solved.
Zhongsha Curators Collaborate to Host Saudi Arabia's First Contemporary Art Biennale - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporters Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) - The inaugural Saudi Arabian contemporary art biennale - Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale, officially opened to the public on the 11th at the Diriyah JAX Art District, located in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other countries participated in the exhibition.
The Biennale is jointly organized by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Tian Feiyu, the curator of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, serving as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennale is "crossing the river by feeling the stones," which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the social and economic transformation period and also reflects the current situation of Saudi society's cultural development.
The Biennial covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and spans six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Edge Thinking", "Approaching the Public", "Beautiful New World", and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total exhibits, including various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art; the works of 12 Chinese artists also receive much attention, with some artists using recycled materials in innovative ways to create their pieces, such as Xu Bing in "The Endless Stream of Mountains and Rivers Behind the Story Series" (2014), where he reconstructed a classic landscape painting using discarded materials.
Buckley, CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, said he hopes that this year's Biennale can establish an international dialogue, allowing global audiences to have the opportunity to learn about the flourishing cultural industry and creative community of Saudi Arabia, and enhance interaction and exchanges.
Tian Feiyu said: "The goal of the Biennale is twofold: both to enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue and to enable Saudi audiences to integrate into the world of contemporary art."
English: According to the information, a series of lectures will also be held during the biennial opening period. Artists, curators, and thought leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and contemporary art development.

Bones are fine, ask the restaurant to pack them separately for delivery.
However, the system is not very convenient, as it requires using another room.

Yunnan: Coordinating and standardizing the management of village public welfare positions - Xinhua News Network
English: Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) - In order to continuously provide employment assistance to the impoverished population and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies related to the management of public welfare positions for promoting rural revitalization, which will help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
A person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Affairs introduced that currently, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 public welfare positions in rural areas, which are used to accommodate the employment of impoverished labor forces and other rural disadvantaged groups. This has played an important role in helping impoverished people to achieve employment and increase their income, consolidate the results of the fight against poverty, and effectively improve the capabilities of various public services in rural areas.
English: The new regulations were jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, Finance, etc. They mainly standardize various aspects such as the target scope of candidates for grassroots recruitment, public welfare job positions in rural areas, fund management, job development, and job management.
In terms of job development and setting, the new regulations clearly state that it should be carried out in accordance with the principles of "setting positions based on demand, defining people by positions, dynamic management, and overall control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible", and "one person, one position, voluntary disclosure, and unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, application, review, public display, hiring, pre-job training, and job arrangement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments for rural public welfare positions, the subsidy standards and methods for rural public welfare positions, and stipulate that the development departments for rural public welfare positions should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for the personnel placed in these positions. The relevant departments are required to regularly supervise the issuance of subsidies for rural public welfare positions.

Hello
Can I cancel the order?
I will place the order again.
Has it been cancelled?
English: Second, although the rightists have had their moments of success in history, they didn't last long. The short duration is because they flourish with just a little sunshine and start sweating with just a sip of water; as soon as they gain a little success, they become greedy for more, and when facing setbacks, they easily become discouraged and yield.
But to be objective, the right-wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied in terms of defining the truth criteria after the end of the Cultural Revolution, promoting economic development and advancing technology, as well as promoting institutionalization of the political system and protection of human rights, and so on.
Thirdly, as far as I am concerned, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's opinions, I do care about what he says and have great respect for him as a person; because he is serious, he takes China seriously, and he also takes China's social issues seriously.
However, I disagree with his anti-communist theory, as I believe opposing the necessary revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihoods, and a mixture of good and bad political groups. Moreover, it creates opportunities for foreign forces to take advantage of the chaos.
4. To change or improve China, we must have patience and a responsible attitude for the country and the people. Those who engage in political speculation and attempt to take advantage of the situation are not conservatives, but scoundrels.
English: Let's talk more about the left.
Left, actually refers to a group of abandoned children of the times and politics.
If we say that the right has a positive significance for society, the Communist Party will also listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. However, the left does not have this advantage because what the left wants is precisely the dregs that the Communist Party has discarded!
5. Recently, I've seen some friends arguing with opponents and refuting radical leftists with great enthusiasm. I think there's really no need for that.
Do not try to reason with traitors and lunatic leftists, as they are all stubborn and unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about making the rebels and the leftists admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this: When the rebels curse you as a fifty-cent, and when the leftists call you a rightist dog, it just proves that our middle path is correct!
Many people have ideals in their youth, but as they grow older, they either forget their ideals or pursue them only to become obsessed.
As the ideal gradually drifts away, even the young dragon slayer eventually becomes an evil dragon.
In my opinion, "left and right" generally refers to constraints and freedom. Due to China's innate historical and cultural genes, China as a whole should lean towards the left.
In China, the right-wing advocates for freedom, focusing on efficiency and development, while the left-wing emphasizes stronger regulation, paying more attention to fairness and safety.
In today's society, there is a general desire to emphasize fairness. At the same time, as China and the United States are in competition, leaning to the left is inevitable, and it is estimated that this will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand, just like it and it's done.
No more words needed, Hua Hua is just so righteous.
In the past two years, the US blockade and encirclement of Huawei's chips have not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament but also caused huge losses for "American-related" companies.
The US is suppressing China's chip industry by demanding its own companies and allied countries' enterprises to block our country's chip industry simultaneously. This directly leads to the impact on global chip suppliers' orders and profits, causing a decrease in R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturing enterprises, and consequently resulting in a shortage and chaos of the global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has affected various major industries worldwide, such as car companies ceasing production and increasing cell phone prices. Almost all industries that use chips have been greatly impacted.
In order to gain control of "chip" autonomy, more and more tech giants in various countries are taking the path of "de-Americanization."
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor industry and curb the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has been making frequent moves recently, such as hosting the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 countries' giants to establish a semiconductor alliance. They have also provided financial support to domestic technology giants like Intel. For instance, the American technology titan Intel is investing 20 billion dollars to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona and expanding its chip foundry business to external clients in order to regain its leading position in the chip field.
English: When most people think that Intel's move this time will have a certain impact on TSMC and may even "steal the rice bowl" of TSMC.
The reason for being so confident is that Intel, as an established technology giant in the United States, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, possessing a large number of talent and technical reserves. It is certain that they can rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company).
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou doesn't care about Intel's decision at all.
At the "2021 Masters Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a startling remark. Regarding Intel's massive investment in building a wafer fab, Zhang Zhongmou bluntly said: Intel building a chip foundry is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou (also known as Morris Chang) disdains Intel's entry into the semiconductor wafer industry is because he still bears a grudge about a past incident between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
English: In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel had always been a shining pearl in the American manufacturing industry, occupying the top position globally and being the dominant force in the world's semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were dominated by a few powerful players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM (Integrated Device Manufacturer) model, where chip design, manufacturing, and packaging and testing were all completed by one factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model has become an unbearable burden for some small enterprises. Many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only step back in the face of the huge costs of production line construction.
Under the influence of market demand, in the 1980s, the chip industry began to show a phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, and thought that since there were those dedicated to design, a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing could be established.
Not long after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC was born as a result.
TSMC (台积电) focuses its main business on the single segment of "wafer processing", not engaging in design, but only providing foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
At that time, the newly founded TSMC was just a small player in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once sought investment from Intel. However, when Intel heard that TSMC only focused on the manufacturing aspect of the chip industry, they evidently held themselves in high regard and looked down on TSMC, decisively refusing to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel looked down on wafer manufacturing services at that time.
English: Unexpectedly, the giants who once looked down on wafer manufacturing services now have to start engaging in wafer foundry work as well.
So, Zhang Zhongmou finds it ironic that Intel is entering the foundry business.
Nowadays, TSMC's market value has already surpassed Intel's.
Facing the aggressive attack from TSMC, Intel naturally cannot afford to be complacent.
Nowadays, TSMC is striving towards 3nm chips, while Intel still remains at the 14nm level from 7 years ago.
English: Catching up is actually not an easy task.
Not waiting anymore
Ordered at 19:06 and it's been 2 hours now 😅
Today, let's take a look at some [strange trending topics].
What is the normal public opinion?
English: Randomly select three hot searches: February 2nd Dragon Raising its Head, Hsu Fu Chi price increase, and the Lalamove incident. The spread of public opinion forms a peak, and then the [index declines] (smooth curve) eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion arises, a smaller peak will appear again.
They look almost identical to the "Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model" that was once displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is an abnormal public opinion?
English: Randomly select six hot searches from the same event, showing a "peak-shaped", "serrated-shaped", and "cliff-shaped" pattern.
【Solitary Peak】refers to artificial heating, quickly rushing to the top of hot searches, and attracting public attention; 【Sawtooth】refers to periodic heating, ensuring that the topic occupies the hot search list; 【Cliff】refers to collective withdrawal, the hot search has fulfilled its "function", and receives new tasks, heading to new battlefields.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat of one event coincides exactly with the trough of another event, with no time difference, indicating that the same group of internet trolls received their orders and launched a new round of attack.
The professionalization of the dark public relations industry can be seen at a glimpse: dozens of hot searches rank simultaneously, some of which attract attention, some provide popular science, some incite conflicts and create momentum, some divert attention, some influence cognition, some mislead judgment, some stir up emotions, and some drive decision-making. Black market accounts operate in batches and nodes, finely dividing their strategies, taking into account almost all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science. By setting aside subjective factors such as stance and emotions and focusing solely on objective data, negative public relations would have nowhere to hide.
Every step leaves a trace, let's uncover these traces together.

English: Mauritius and other countries report first cases of Omicron variant infection for the first time - Xinhua News
English: Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 - According to comprehensive reports from Xinhua's foreign correspondents, Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have recently reported the first cases of infection with the new COVID-19 variant Omicron strain.
English: Mauritius reported its first two cases of Omicron variant infections on December 10th.
According to the Mauritian Health Minister, Kailesh Jagutpal, one of the infected individuals is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27; the other infected individual is a local resident of Mauritius, who tested positive for the virus on November 30 after coming into contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa.
After being treated in isolation at the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of these two infected individuals turned negative, and they have now returned to their respective residences.
English: On the 10th, Cyprus Health Ministry announced the country's first 3 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant infections.
These 3 people are all students who returned from traveling abroad at the beginning of this month. Since they all have mild symptoms, they have not been hospitalized for treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the Serbian government is continuously increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th next year, passengers aged 12 and above entering the country by plane will need to pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on the 10th that they will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in the country.
Malawi's Minister of Health, Khumbize Kandodo Chiponda, said on the 9th that the country has detected 3 cases of Omicron variant infection for the first time.
The country's health department conducted genomic sequencing on 12 COVID-positive samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd, and identified these 3 infection cases.

English: Address: 12th Floor, Happiness Home, No. 156 Huan-Cheng South Road
In the beginning, a friend introduced it to me because of trust, so I decided to take a look. Initially, my budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
English: Upon arriving at the store, a series of deceptions began.
English: This is my first time visiting the store, and I just showed them the floor plan of my house. They haven't actually measured the house on site, yet they can give me a quote saying that my 135 square meter house can be completed for 70,000 yuan. They roughly showed me their materials, but I don't even know what brand of materials they use.
Their second scam is that as soon as you arrive at the store, they will drag you into paying a deposit (and once this money is paid, you can never get it back, unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
While I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, they can offer you a certain discount.
This is a big trap, and I am a living example of being deceived. In a moment of impulsiveness, I paid a deposit of more than 10,000 yuan.
He gave me a quote with many issues - 70,000 doesn't include water and electricity modification, nor any doors and cabinets for the bathroom. These three items are the major costs for basic renovation.
Apart from these, the service fees they charge are also higher than those of other companies.
I have lost trust in this company, as they asked me to sign a contract without clarifying anything at the beginning.
When I went to ask them for a refund, they appeared very experienced and had a dedicated small team to deal with you.
No matter what, it will always be considered the customer's problem and they hold no responsibility whatsoever.
Various shirking of responsibilities, and there are many details, I don't want to talk about them one by one as they are all tears. In short, don't choose them, because the house my friend had them renovate also had poor quality, and they will charge you all kinds of fees in the later stage.
Pitiful, they were originally the deceptive leading decoration company, now changed to "Da Mei", it seems like they have gone bankrupt again and changed to something else.
So everyone, don't choose such a deceptive renovation company.
English: In the future, when making choices, everyone should search more on Baidu and inquire about these consultations because renovation is not a small expense.
To ask questions to the merchant, please login or register first.
Strictly prohibit the release of various forms of merchant reviews, for details, please refer to the merchant inclusion statement.
Dazhong Dianping's Kunming Decoration Design Channel provides you with the latest merchant information, such as address, telephone, and business hours for Dajia 360 Integrated Home Decoration. For finding decoration companies, just visit Dazhong Dianping.
So scary, if it doesn't arrive within 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Is there really no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, then don't cancel this conversation. If my refund doesn't come within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue the matter.
I asked if it can be cancelled within less than 15 minutes.
The koushui chicken should be cooked, but raw meat was received, cannot eat it.
Starry Sky Appointment | Geminid Meteor Shower Peaks on the 14th - Xinhua News
English: Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12th (Reporter Zhou Runjian) - Astronomy popularization experts introduce that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, the Geminid meteor shower, will reach its peak on December 14th. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the second half of the night on that day.
Beijing astronomy enthusiast An Jiu captured the Geminid meteor shower on December 13, 2018, in Qinghai.
Most of the parent bodies of meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is actually the 3200 Phaethon asteroid, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "bred" by comets.
Tianjin Astronomical Society Council member and astronomy popularization expert Xiu Lipeng said that just like a New Year blockbuster movie, the Geminid meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, and its "showing period" can last from December 4th to 17th.
The meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and is called one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, along with the Quadrantids and Perseids meteor showers.
One of the notable features of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteors have relatively slow speeds and rich colors, with a good number of fireballs, making it suitable for both visual observation and for beginners in astronomical photography to capture.
English: On December 13, 2020, Tianjin amateur astronomer Yang Jing captured the Geminid meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin.
The astronomical forecast shows that this year's Geminid meteor shower will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14th. During the peak, the ZHR (the number of meteors seen per hour under ideal observation conditions when the radiant point is directly overhead) will be 150.
English: Gemini Meteor Shower Recommended Index Chart.
Last year, the "colorful" Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be affected by moonlight, which will somewhat reduce the spectacular display.
English: The 14th is the 11th day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar, and the moon phase is a gibbous moon. The bright moonlight may interfere with observation, but fortunately, the moon will set in the second half of the night. At this time, the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
English: Friends who enjoy meteor showers can observe them during the few hours after the moon sets in the latter half of the night, but remember to stay warm and protect against the cold.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
It is not recommended to observe in the city. Instead, you can choose a location in the suburbs or countryside with high altitude, low light pollution, and facing the northeast direction with an open view. After patiently waiting for the moon to set, you can observe with the naked eye.
It should be noted that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so there is no need to stare at the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower during observation.
For photography enthusiasts who want to capture stunning images of a 'meteor shower', it is best to choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and sustainability considerations, tripods, spare batteries, and shutter cables are also essential.
Xiulipeng reminds saying.
What are the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs?
English: Based on my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the questioner should refer to LCD TV, and the main differences in market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV are mainly the following two points:
First, laser televisions are more focused on the large screen market.
Compared to the widespread market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are more focused on the large-screen market, or it could be said that laser TVs are inherently designed for large screens.
Currently, the mainstream LCD TV sizes range from 55 to 65 inches, while the sizes of laser TVs are generally over 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting users' demand for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the global shipment and sales proportion of laser TVs has been steadily increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total sales of 80-inch and above TVs.
English: According to the forecast by Zhongyikang, in 2020, the sales volume of the laser TV market will increase by more than 140%, continuing to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason for such good results in the large screen market is mainly due to the outstanding performance of laser TV in terms of eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection in laser televisions, the light emitted by the laser source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared to the backlight source of liquid crystal televisions, the imaging process is closer to the natural imaging process of objects, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
English: The China Electronics Standardization Institute SAI West Laboratory and Beijing Union Hospital Ophthalmology experts conducted a strict comparative test of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions in a population, obtaining 144 sets of test data.
English: Data confirms that laser TV indeed has strong eye protection features, and even has certain improvement effects in specific aspects.
In the context of increasing emphasis on vision health, laser TVs not only attract more and more users with their eye protection advantages but also open up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in liquid crystal TV prices, the current market price of laser TVs is mostly over 10,000 yuan. As the size and light source upgrade, the price gradually increases.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
English: There must be a reason.
Under the continuous development of light sources and technology, laser TVs have many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD TVs and projectors.
With ultra-short throw projection technology, laser TVs have a much shorter projection distance compared to traditional projection equipment, enabling a 100-inch large screen experience within a short distance. The required space is not large, and the main unit is compact, occupying a very small area.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can achieve over 2000 lumens.
In addition, the lower heat dissipation results in less wear and tear on the equipment, thus extending the TV's service life.
Apart from this, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, bionic screens, and numerous cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more stunning audio-visual experience.
It's not a false demand, but rather a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not the preferred choice for audio and video enthusiasts. However, if you want to balance a large screen with a less-than-ideal viewing environment, you can give it a try. Everything has its pros and cons, so it's important to weigh them and make your own judgments. Just be careful not to blindly believe one side of the story.
In simple terms, ultra-wide-angle short-throw projectors, also known as laser TVs, have to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflective mirrors in order to be close to the screen, which does not conform to the optimal optical design.
In order to block some ambient light, using a microstructured Fresnel screen is expensive, and the price of an 80-inch one can basically be exchanged for a 65-inch LCD.
In addition, I particularly dislike the marketing technique used by projection manufacturers claiming that diffuse reflection is good for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light. If you diffuse the light to the ceiling, the eyes will not be able to see it. To be precise, even a liquid crystal TV involves diffuse "direct light." Doesn't the ceiling also get illuminated when the TV is turned on?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse reflection, it cannot form an image at all.
English: The hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen that is often overlooked, a large amount of light reflected from a certain angle to the eyes, that is truly uncomfortable.
Wen She Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery, a premium quality store, currently has no branches.
After adding WeChat to make an appointment, the young lady sent me the available time slots, and her response to messages was quite prompt~
Before going, I looked at the photos taken in the store, which mainly featured beautiful outdoor wedding dresses, involving a wide variety of shooting styles.
After arriving that day, I briefly communicated my thoughts with the young lady, and she very patiently helped me try on two sets of clothes in the styles I was torn between. Finally, we decided on the makeup and styling~ Before taking pictures, the photographer would arrange some props and guide the poses, paying close attention to every detail in pursuit of perfection.
But maybe because there was no specific communication with me about the shooting ideas, the resulting style is not what I wanted. However, it should still be good-looking🙊🙊
After taking the photos, the photographer will help to select the pictures, discuss the post-production style, and I feel they are quite attentive.
The repaired film will take about half a month, just wait for the results~
The second time I won the free photo shoot event - I could choose one outfit from most of the clothes available for the shoot.
In the end, a black gauze skirt was chosen to experience a different style.
The entire shooting process takes about 2 hours, including makeup and photography. The photographer in charge is a young guy born after 1995, and he seems a bit inexperienced. I hope he can provide more guidance on posing for customers in the future. He's quite talkative, and the shooting process was quite enjoyable.
Wen She Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery - Premium Quality Store Reply
Made it to the homepage, come and take a look at Queenie too~
Upon arriving at the store, you first fill in your name and phone number, and then choose clothing. Wedding dresses can also be selected. They are quite patient, even if you change three or four outfits. After making your selection, the makeup takes a while, but the service attitude is good. During the photoshoot, they will teach you how to pose. The only issue is that the photos make your face appear quite large. They said the photo retouching would take half a month, but the final images were sent after just three or four days, and there seemed to be little difference between the retouched and original photos.
English: [Environment] Overall, it's quite good.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are about three makeup spots, and inside is the photo studio.
English: [Service] Very enthusiastic and attentive.
The stylist is quite patient.
The photographer will also teach you poses seriously.
Not satisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to reshoot.
[Experience] The style might be a bit too much, as the original double eyelids have been turned into triple eyelids.
The ends of the eyebrows were also shaved, which is a bit awkward for those who don't draw their eyebrows daily.
The photo was given more than ten days ago, but I'm not very satisfied with the Photoshop effect. I feel that the double eyelid tapes are still very noticeable.
Because I wasn't sure about the style, I tried on two sets. After going back and forth, I chose the black evening gown. The lady said that this set has a more Audrey Hepburn retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started getting my hair and makeup done. The hairstylist and makeup artist were both extremely patient in helping me, and I was very satisfied with the results.
After finishing the makeup and hair, we started taking photos. The photographer guided me in posing throughout the whole process, making it very relaxed and pleasant.
After taking the photos, we carefully selected four favorite ones for retouching. The guy said they would be ready within 15 days. In the end, we were very satisfied and happy with the results.
It has been 3 days without a reply... Due to your system's inability to recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly subscription plan!
The strangest thing is, I use the same credit card for payment every time.
I have to pay shipping fees every time now.
Can you waive the fee first, and charge me the monthly fee after you complete your investigation? Is that acceptable?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Xiaoyusan is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions, according to the "Insurance Intermediary Supervision Regulations (2015 Revision)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three key requirements must be met: shareholders and sponsors must have no major violations of laws and regulations in the past three years, the minimum registered capital is RMB 50 million, and the establishment must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three requirements are actually quite stringent. In summary, a company must have strength, be approved by the national authoritative department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which regulates insurance companies and banks nationwide), and have shareholders with good work ethic. As for Xiaoyusan Insurance, an insurance brokerage company, policyholders do not need to worry too much about whether Xiaoyusan Insurance is legitimate or not, as not all insurance companies can meet these three criteria.
At this point, it's not bad and is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Little Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, where many companies' star critical illness insurance products are sold on this platform, such as the recently launched Hetai Super Mario No. 5 Critical Illness Insurance. Both the claim and underwriting parties are Hetai Life Insurance, and Little Umbrella Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to doubt its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode: Internet platform products have a generally higher cost-performance ratio because they have less operating costs from brick-and-mortar branches and lower employee salary costs. Moreover, the payment methods are flexible, supporting monthly payments, which can alleviate the payment pressure on policyholders and maximize the leverage of insurance.
This part is still quite good.
English: Can be considered.
From the perspective of professional competence of salespeople: This is particularly important, as insurance is an industry with very high professional requirements. Many internet product users can insure themselves, which may lead to a lot of misunderstandings in health disclosure and occupation. Non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective perception when insuring, thinking that they are healthy or meet the requirements, and this can easily lead to many hidden risks in claims and even the possibility of being denied compensation.
English: I once worked as an insurance telemarketer at "Tencent WeBao" (similar to Little Umbrella, it is also an online insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsibly telling everyone.
The insurance on the internet is real and reliable. It is the people who are unreliable. There are no professional practitioners in the internet channels, and there are many instances of sales misinformation.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buying insurance comes with a free mobile phone, and you can get 60,000 critical illness coverage for free. There is nothing wrong with these marketing strategies, but they tend to emphasize the benefits while downplaying the costs. They won't tell the policyholder that after the first month's 1 yuan fee, normal charges will apply from the second month onwards, ranging from tens to 200 yuan. Many customers may not be clear on what they have purchased even after being charged for one or two years.
Thought you could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company would compensate 6 million (pie in the sky).
Free mobile phone giveaway is for special policy numbers ending with 6666, 8888, etc. Moreover, if the winning message is sent out and you don't redeem it yourself, there will be nobody to remind you.
(For the policyholder, this is another pitfall) Getting 60,000 RMB of free critical illness insurance coverage is short-term. If you only rely on this and have no other commercial insurance, in case a critical illness occurs, 60,000 RMB won't be enough to solve the problem, and the future life will begin "naked running" (meaning exposed to risks without adequate protection).
Currently, the government is strictly cracking down on misleading internet insurance sales.
So, in general, there is no problem with the platform and the products, but the issue lies in the professionalism and work ethics of the salesperson.
English: It is suggested that the questioner should consider comprehensively and carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies offer a wider range of products, providing customers with more opportunities and options to choose from. Some products also have a better cost-performance ratio compared to online products.
I have personally helped 59 Internet customers with their offline insurance products, saving each person 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If anyone has any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange ideas with me.
I am Mingya, an insurance broker with over 3 years of experience in corporate management training. I have served nearly a thousand enterprise users and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before taking out insurance, I will start from the customer's needs and tailor insurance products for them. During the insurance process, I will help clients compare offers from different companies and strive to get the best underwriting results for them. After the insurance is in place, I will handle policy organization and policy custody, ensuring clients can have peace of mind without worries.
Grow with each customer for a lifetime.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the questioner!
According to the definition by insurance regulatory authorities, Internet insurance refers to the insurance business where the policyholder can independently complete all insurance procedures after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, the insurance consultant does not need to sign either, and all steps can be completed independently by the policyholder.
Although purchasing insurance online may lack a sense of "ceremony" and may not even have a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This mode is somewhat similar to the "telemarketing" assembly line operation, but purchasing insurance in this way may also have a fatal problem - that is, the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we purchase insurance, shouldn't we carefully consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is someone who can accompany us for the long term and provide us with services even many years later as an "insurance intermediary"?
English: How can I get in touch with the delivery specialist?
It's already almost 3 o'clock.
Does that mean I will get compensation?
I said to knock on the door for delivery.
But the rider left it at the door and then the person left.
Still delivered wrongly
Your rider has already picked up my takeaway at #NUMBER#, but it is still showing as waiting.
The rider received my takeaway at 19:25, but still refused to set off.
I've finished buying, do you want any other takeout?
What to do
Where did your rider go?
Do we still need to wait?
I am here to deliver an order.
Okay, if you don't cancel, I'll call the police.
But my food may have safety and hygiene issues.

Just need to replenish the discount code.
No problem, remember there is no need to arrange a redelivery, I have already purchased another one and don't want to waste.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to such villains.
If we disregard political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
From the moment you started sending me Facebook friend requests, to posting sarcastic posts, and then attempting to disclose my so-called home address and father's name on social media, I have adopted a non-responsive attitude.
After that, you vigorously continued to tag me not just at a frequency of six meals a day, and even discussed some obscure and humiliating comments about me with your so-called friends on Facebook, such as appearance, figure, good upbringing, and topics about doing things in bed like giving hickies, whether or not to insert, etc. I just let it go.
English: Later on, I received messages from several friends about a photo of you and comments with sexual harassment elements on your Facebook account.
English: I'm sorry, as a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
After the news of my reporting to the police was uploaded, you didn't restrain yourself at all, but became even more arrogant.
I don't care about your political background or your status and identity; in our society, mutual respect between the sexes is necessary.
Yes, you can continue with these sarcastic, obscure, humiliating, and abusive remarks, and you can also continue to say that you are just caring for and paying attention to me. You can continue to think that this is not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that you didn't create those images or to make any offensive comments.
That's right, I cannot and do not have the ability to stop you all.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and my appearance and figure definitely do not need your comments and opinions.
I don't even think there's a single girl who would be willing to let others humiliate her so much just to become famous.
A friend asked me, "Are you okay?"
I said it's good, but you won't believe it.
I think there won't be any girl who can say she's fine after being bullied like this.
English: Regardless of whether it is in work, society, politics, or the business world, only those who lack even basic morals will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe, justice lies in the hearts of the people.
I have cut a portion of the comments for everyone to judge.
Your own posts should be safe from anyone impersonating you, right?
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization.

Vietnam People's Daily Online - Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attends the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Technology Business Development Forum
During the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two main conferences were held, discussing topics revolving around digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, as well as digital technology enterprises and the economic recovery and development during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Minister of Communications and Media, Nguyen Manh Hung, stated that in 2021, despite the continuous spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number and revenue of Vietnamese digital technology companies still maintained a growth trend, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, the number of typical digital products in Vietnam has grown, focusing on solving major challenges faced by Vietnam. Many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has been improved.
Minister Ruan Mengxiong calls on digital technology companies to take on the responsibility of developing national digital transformation platforms, and taking on the task of developing these national digital platforms is tantamount to fulfilling the national mission.
On the forum, leaders from various departments and national agencies, as well as enterprises, organizations, and individuals engaged in researching, developing, applying, and transferring digital technologies, shared their groundbreaking ideas and solutions for mobilizing and pooling resources from the whole society to develop Vietnamese technology companies, jointly promoting the country's digital transformation, and economic recovery after the pandemic.
During his speech at the forum, Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized that digital transformation is an inevitable path for the world and an objective need for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation serves the whole population, so it is necessary to mobilize the participation of everyone.
The people and enterprises are the core, main body, goal, and driving force of digital transformation.
English: Therefore, all policies should be for the benefit of the people and businesses.
Premier Fan Mingzheng emphasizes that the digital transformation needs to reflect the national spirit, focusing on internal strength as the main, strategic, long-term, and decisive factors, and external forces as important and breakthrough points.
He also believes that digital transformation needs to drive in-depth development and sustainable development, participate in COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control, economic recovery and development, cope with subsequent changes, overcome the depletion of natural resources, and help green transformation and develop green energy.
Digital transformation requires participation in the establishment of databases for the protection and promotion of national cultural values, historical traditions, national customs, and regional culture, as well as promoting digital transformation in areas such as banking, taxation, land management and development database, and logistics.
The ultimate goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and promote the continuous prosperity and development of the nation.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng urges governments at all levels, institutions, and enterprises to increase leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, enhance understanding of digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve the system for digital transformation, strengthen national management and promote the development of digital technology enterprises in the spirit of respect, communication, listening, positivity, and proactivity.
During the forum, Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng attended the 2021 "Vietnamese Manufacturing" Outstanding Digital Products Award Ceremony and the opening ceremony of the "Vietnamese Manufacturing" Digital Products Exhibition.

High-speed Rail Home
Address: No. 555, High-speed Railway North 1st Road, View Map
Here, household appliances are quite complete, with a wide range of brands and all well-known brands available.
During the Double Twelve shopping event, we went to the "Hansdun" water purifier store to check out water purifiers. The store was having a promotion with more favorable prices.
Juran Home has a total of 11 floors, from the negative second floor to the ninth floor. Both negative first and negative second floors are parking areas, and parking is free during the day!
The surroundings are not impressive, with only a few restaurants and hardware stores, and the taste of the food at the restaurants is just average.
This elevator is really speechless, just like having a serious illness, going back and forth between the negative second and negative first floors, not stopping at the floor I pressed. Going down to the first floor through the safety passage is also very speechless, it leads directly to a furniture store, and the furniture store is closed, making it impossible to exit through the safety passage!
Juran Home still needs improvement, as many areas remain undeveloped.
Address: No. 555, GaoTie North First Road, Shayibake District. Convenient transportation, large parking lot, and parking is free during the day.
Environment: To be honest, the store is quite spacious, with 8-9 floors offering all kinds of furniture, household appliances, and various small items that you'd want for your home. There are many well-known brands present in the store, such as Mlily, Oppein, Fotile, Huanston, Akbe, Friendly, Fairwhale, Richfield, Vatti, Nature, Zhonglian, Midea, Aidon, and so many more that I can't even remember them all. It's a great place to purchase products, and if you get tired, you can always take a break and sit on the available sofas to rest.
Recently, I've been wanting to buy a comfortable sofa. My friend said there are many sofas to choose from here. I've looked at Kuka Home and Mecor's options, and they seem good, but the prices are a bit expensive, so I'm still struggling to decide.

The Yangtze River mainstream achieves full coverage of green integrated service areas on water - Xinhua News Agency
English: Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11th (Reporter Wang Xian) - Chongqing Fuling Waterborne Green Comprehensive Service Zone was completed and put into operation as scheduled on December 10th. This is the second waterborne green comprehensive service zone officially operating on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, following the launch of the Sichuan Luzhou Waterborne Green Comprehensive Service Zone on December 8th.
Up to now, the green integrated service area on the water has covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
English: Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Yangtze River Navigation Bureau of the Ministry of Transport, introduced that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces have built and operated 10 waterborne green integrated service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been widely recognized by the crew members, and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of green integrated service areas on water is another milestone event in the construction of green shipping on the Yangtze River, which has significantly improved the capacity of receiving pollutants from ships and shipping services.
According to the introduction, the Waterborne Green Integrated Service Area is an important facility that provides comprehensive production and living services for a wide range of ships and crew members, helping them solve "urgent, difficult, worrying, and eager" problems.
The completion and operation of the two green integrated service areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River combines life services, production services, and public services. With a green environmental protection theme and featuring ship maintenance and emergency rescue services, it enables the "one-time berthing, multiple services" for ships in the port. This will make the work of sailors who sail along the Yangtze River throughout the year more efficient and their lives more convenient.
Three US aircraft carriers gather near China, strongest weapon rarely visits Guam, January 17, 2022, Duowei - Pro-CCP media Duowei reports: Latest news on China-US relations: Recent satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering near China; US media also revealed that one of the US Navy's most powerful weapons made a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to both allies and adversaries of the United States in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform," on January 9th, a satellite detected the US aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson near the Strait of Balabac.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea and is a strategic location on the first island chain of the Western Pacific.
The platform predicts that the "Carl Vinson" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first time the Carl Vinson aircraft carrier has deployed with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft onboard.
Currently patrolling the Pacific Ocean, the U.S. naval aircraft carriers include not only the USS Carl Vinson but also the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3rd.
The "Lincoln" has also carried the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aforementioned aircraft carriers, the US Navy currently has the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier deployed in the Asia-Pacific region, stationed in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Sham Plain Lake" missile cruiser and the "Stokdal" missile destroyer.
Three US Aircraft Carriers Gather Around China; Most Powerful Weapon Rarely Visits Guam - On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
English: (Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) Three US aircraft carriers gather around China, the most powerful weapon makes a rare visit to Guam. On January 17, 2022, the flight route of the U.S. navy cargo aircraft CMV-22B.
(Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) According to a CNN report on January 17th, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine "USS Nevada" carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads entered the US Naval Base in Guam last Saturday (January 15th).
Three US aircraft carriers gather near China's periphery; the most powerful weapons make a rare visit to Guam. Analysts say this sends a signal to both allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit of a US ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
English: Three US aircraft carriers gather around China; the most powerful weapon rarely visits Guam. In recent years, China has built numerous military facilities in the Spratly Islands.
English: The picture shows China's Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
English: (South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine "USS Nevada" to Guam has strengthened the cooperation between the United States and its regional allies, demonstrating the U.S.'s capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and its continuous commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly known as "Boomer submarines."
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thunder Submarines" in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the "Thunder Submarine" the most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad, which also includes silo-based ballistic missiles located in the United States and bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
Discuss with friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta's stock, a market value evaporation of 251 billion US dollars, Zuckerberg responds "facing unprecedented competition", what is the reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with its main revenue coming from advertisements. Nowadays, the profitable advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and so on, regardless of their functional positioning, are all traffic channels for Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", with many Apps connecting to Meta's ads. Monetization is achieved through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, due to the adjustments in Apple's privacy policy, it has become difficult for Meta to obtain user data, which affects the efficiency of ad placements.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, clearly prompting users whether to allow the App to access their information, and most people's normal reaction would definitely be not to allow it.
English: If Google takes another stab at Meta in the future, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain how high, but it does exist).
English: Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly contributed by Chinese companies engaged in overseas business.
Meta has roughly a few hundred employees in its Hong Kong office and several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies looking to expand into overseas markets cannot avoid advertising through Meta, as a large portion of their spending goes to Meta.
Interestingly, ByteDance's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta has made a considerable amount of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
Domestic agents are helping Byte to place advertisements on Meta, and Meta's performance in the Greater China region is also quite good.
Recently, I haven't specifically looked into it, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The phase of Chinese companies massively spending money overseas has already passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not going smoothly.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are no longer in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in revenue, but also the lack of expectations for growth.
The capital market not only values revenue but more importantly looks at future prospects and expectations.
It is quite evident that Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about the "metaverse."
The metaverse is indeed one of the directions for the future, but the implementation cycle of the metaverse is relatively long. This story may not be enough to support Meta's market value in the next two or three years.
So, the next two years should be a relatively difficult period for Meta.
English: Although Facebook is very popular now, with an annual revenue of 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars, it actually faces a strong sense of crisis. Compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there isn't much of a safe and secure moat for protection.
Although his several social media apps currently have relatively high daily active users and are mainstream social media apps, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., facing the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook does not have much confidence, and the upheaval could happen in the blink of an eye.
The concept of creating a metaverse, which seems unattainable, has no hope of success in the short term, making Facebook very risky. This is also the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg has changed the company's name and is constantly seeking new avenues. However, I think his choice of direction is wrong and is a dead-end. The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
Article 17: The state implements a registered practice management system for qualified fire protection engineers.
English: Personnel who have obtained the first and second level certificates of registered fire engineer qualifications can practice under the name of registered fire engineer at the corresponding level upon registration.
Article 18: The Fire Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security is the registration and approval department for first-class registered fire engineer qualifications.
Provincial, autonomous region, and municipality public security fire departments serve as the registration and approval departments for second-level registered fire engineer qualifications, and are responsible for the preliminary review of first-level registered fire engineer qualification registration.
Article 19: Personnel who have obtained the first and second level registered fire engineer qualification certificates and applied for registration shall be employed by an approved fire technical service institution or a key fire safety unit, and submit the registration application materials to the fire department of the public security organ at the location of the employing unit (for employing units affiliated with enterprises, submit through the enterprise to the industrial and commercial registration location).
Article 20: When the public security fire department of a province, autonomous region, or municipality directly under the Central Government receives the registration application materials from the applicant, if the application materials are incomplete or do not conform to the statutory form, they should inform the applicant of all the contents that need to be corrected on the spot or within 5 working days. If the applicant is not informed within the time limit, it shall be deemed as accepted from the date of receiving the application materials.
For both accepted and rejected registration applications, a written certificate with the official stamp of the local public security fire department and the date should be provided.
