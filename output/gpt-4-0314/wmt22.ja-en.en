Finally, I got my Social Security Number.

Well, I guess it was good practice for speaking English on the phone... but it's too hard to understand English over the phone.

That's why I don't feel like watching TV anymore...
So, does that mean it's impossible for comedians? TV is full of comedians, after all.
Yesterday, I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix, and there were quite a few scenes where the staff laughed out loud in the background even when nothing particularly interesting was being said.
It's clearly not a funny place, but it can't be helped that the forced laughter of "I have to laugh at everything they say because they are a popular comedian" is creepy.
But if the staff doesn't laugh, the comedian's mood will be spoiled, and it would be awkward in terms of work relationships, right?
In the past, that industry was like a black company with a strong sports club-like atmosphere, and it seems that some entertainers have overly large egos, leading them to have a nasty attitude. They probably have to act that way to make a living.
On the other hand, there are a lot of cases where the comedians themselves exaggerate the difficulty of their work, constantly saying things like "Don't underestimate comedians."
I understand that the income is quite low until you start selling, but even if I'm told that being a comedian is a difficult profession and stands at the top of the summit, it doesn't really matter.
It sounds like nothing but self-glamorization of their own careers and justification for the overly high status of comedians in media and society.
To be honest, there are quite tough aspects in the industry I work in, but I feel like things related to the world of entertainers are becoming more and more difficult to deal with.
I'm sorry for complaining so much.
It felt like it wasn't good for the body unless I let it out like a fart...

Gift of a sample to the purchaser
The product I ordered at Tsukumo Net Shop was replaced without my permission.
Summary: When I ordered a discounted wireless mouse, I received the wired version instead, and was told to return it if I wanted a refund.
This is more about online shopping troubles rather than a topic on custom-built PCs, but I can't help but feel dissatisfied with the situation and since it's a well-known place, I'll write about it here.
English: The origin of this issue was when I discovered that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was being sold for 3,280 yen at Tsukumo Net Shop's Tsukumo Day Sale, which started from the previous Friday (link to archived page).
At the store, the wired version was the same price, so I considered the possibility of a price mistake and checked the wired version's page, which was 5,071 yen (link to the archived page), so I thought it might not be a mistake and placed an order.
The order confirmation email arrived normally, and the next day shipping email also arrived.
In these two emails and the purchase history on My Page, the name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written.
From the time of order to shipping, there were no mistakes in communication or cancellation notices, so at this point, I thought that the ordered wireless mouse would arrive.
From here on is the problem, a few hours after shipping I received an email saying "There was a mistake in the product registration."
According to that email
The wireless version was being sold at a special sale price, but it turned out to be the wired version.
English: * Since we have already shipped the wired mouse,
1. Refuse to accept and cancel everything
2. Return the mouse only for a refund
3. Use the wired mouse as it is
Choose the response
The product pages for the wired and wireless versions are separate, and the purchase history, emails, and delivery notes all say "wireless version," but it seems they sent the wired version without permission.
Isn't it terrible that they sent a different product without consent, and if I want a refund, I have to send it back from my side?
In the end, even if I accept the refund, I want to counterattack somehow, so please lend me your wisdom.
English: If you were looking for a partner or participating in marriage-seeking activities, would you not want to date someone who has a bad relationship with their parents?
Is it unrelated?
English: If you care, why is that?
For example, people who have cut ties with their parents, siblings or other family members.
I don't particularly mind.
The reason for bad relationships can be due to various personalities and unreasonable people, even among family and siblings.

Twice isolated... Due to typhoons and heavy rain, the only bridge connecting to the area is washed away; Residents triple emergency food stocks in Yabamachi, Fukushima Prefecture (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
English: Mr. Koro Matsumoto from the Takachiho area of Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan Typhoon had a significant impact on the lives of 8 people in the 3-generation household.
Matsumoto Yoshiro-san: "At first, it feels like 'Seriously?', doesn't it?"
English: "I felt like it was going to be broken so easily, or washed away," said a resident about the only road connecting the Takachiho district, the "Takachiho Bridge," which was washed away by the East Japan typhoon, leaving 11 households with 30 residents isolated.
English: Residents forced to endure water outages had to continue transporting necessary supplies daily by using a JR railway bridge, which is normally off-limits to pedestrians.
Matsumoto Yoshiro: "Usually, cars can come up to the garden, but if you get off the car over there, you have to hold it in your hand or carry it on your back, walk across the iron bridge, and come all the way here. So, I felt the value of transportation and cars." The temporary bridge completed a month later was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months, and it became isolated again for a few days until a temporary bridge was built.
Over two years have passed since the disaster and recovery has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto continues to implement measures based on the lessons learned.
Matsumoto Yoshiro-san: "I think there are about 10 cases."
For now, I would like to secure at least two to three days' worth of provisions." I have prepared about three times more emergency food, such as canned goods and cup noodles, than before the disaster.
Misako Matsumoto: "It's not someone else's problem, and we don't know when a disaster may strike us, so I strongly feel that everyone should have at least some emergency supplies." On the other hand, Yabasai Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" where a bridge was washed away.
In order to not forget the lesson, we started a unique initiative in our town from 2021.
Yamatsumachi Education Division, Chief Ryuuichi Takahashi: "We have established 'Yamatsumachi Disaster Prevention Day' and announced that from next year onwards, we would like to make October 12th a day to think about preparedness for disaster prevention."
I think the awareness of unexpected events happening has increased more than ever before.

English: However, from what I can remember, in Hiroyuki's video, he mentioned that even if people with bad relationships with their parents are told by organizations providing food, clothing, and shelter not to come, if they go anyways, the organizations will somehow help them (vague memory). So, it seems like there are such organizations out there.
Experience the Paralympics in VR (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! News
On December 12, 2021, Tokyo held an event where participants could run the Paralympic marathon course, which was digitally recreated.
This event was held to let people experience the new enjoyment of sports and the tourist attractions of Tokyo through digital means.
In the venue, running machines and road bikes were prepared, and visitors who came to the venue wore dedicated equipment and sprinted along the Paralympic marathon course reproduced in the virtual space.
In the virtual space displayed on each tablet, participants can see their own avatar and compete with other participants from both domestic and overseas as they run along the marathon course. Furthermore, they can also enjoy famous sightseeing spots in Tokyo.
Participants said, "The scenery changed dramatically and it was really enjoyable."
"Running through the streets of Tokyo like this, it's tough when you're running, but being able to run while enjoying it is really fun, and I think it was good that I worked hard until the end while competing with everyone." The city official says, "We would like to set up in places like sports gyms after the new year, so that people can enjoy it there as well."

Be cautious when purchasing second-hand houses!
English: "Pitfalls of the Building Condition Survey System" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
English: ● In order to revitalize the used housing market, the newly established "Building Condition Survey" system has made used housing transactions favorable.
Detached houses and condominiums are both increasing in price, and the renovation market is also showing a trend of expansion.
In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the desire for owning a home is increasing, while properties characterized by words such as "station-front," "station-close," "directly connected to the station," "large-scale," and "tower" are experiencing a surge in popularity. This has also been influenced by the drastic decline in relatively affordable new properties.
[View the image of this article] However, compared to overseas, the share of existing (used) housing circulation in Japan is still at a relatively low level.
In 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) partially amended the Building Lots and Buildings Transaction Business Law and started a building condition survey, also known as an inspection, for the purpose of promoting safe and secure transactions of used houses (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which architects who are well-versed in residential properties check the current condition of the property, including its deterioration and the condition of the building, and present a compiled report to the buyer.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism explains that the introduction of inspections provides benefits to both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid claims after handing over the property by conducting a property investigation before the sale transaction, which gives the buyer a sense of security.
It can even lead to differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, for the buyer, it is a system where they can understand the condition of the used house they plan to purchase and be satisfied with the purchase. At first glance, it seems to be a system with significant benefits.
English: Under the current system, the seller mainly holds the initiative in building condition surveys.
In addition, please note that only the announcement of the inspection system has become obligatory.
In other words, real estate agents in charge of mediation have an obligation to explain that they can either "introduce an architect who can conduct a building condition survey during property mediation" or "cannot do that," but the actual implementation of the inspection itself is not mandatory.
English: ● Risks associated with seller-led inspections On the other hand, looking overseas, similar systems are already in place in countries with thriving used markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom.
In the preliminary stage of housing transactions, the buyer requests a building inspection from professionals called "inspectors" or "building surveyors."
For example, in the case of the United States, depending on the state, inspections are carried out in 70-90% of used home transactions.
In the aspect that the "buyer" ultimately leads the inspection, it greatly differs in nature from the Japan-style inspection which is mainly focused on the "seller."
The seller side tries to present the building's condition as well as possible, and sell it as high and as quickly as possible.
On the other hand, the buyer side carefully examines the survey content and thinks about making appropriate repairs to live in peace of mind.
Even if it is the same inspection, there is a discrepancy between the goals and thoughts of both parties.
Therefore, the following points have been pointed out as risks of concern regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of the seller-led inspections established by the country is kept to a minimum.
Since it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking truly important issues. For inspection companies, intermediary companies (sellers) who introduce them to projects can also be considered their clients.
Therefore, there is a possibility that an inspection may be conducted with "consideration" for the seller, such as not reporting unfavorable survey results.

It was quite tough.
However, my mental state had recovered, so I was full of motivation.
My body couldn't keep up and I used to have a research job, so I would fall asleep at work.
English: Since it was the second time in a year, I thought I would just take a month off, say goodbye to my crappy company, and move on. But it turned out to be more severe than I expected, and it took longer because the medication didn't seem to work well.
Anyway, it is important to go to a psychiatrist and have them deal with it correctly, and to keep a record of your outpatient visits (super important).
English: If you have a history of visiting the hospital, even if you resign due to personal reasons, at the employment office (Hello Work), the doctor's decision can change it to a company-related resignation, so the hurdle for receiving unemployment insurance and other benefits is significantly lowered.
Even if you can't find a job easily, or if you want to take a break, you'll be able to have financial and emotional leeway.

Was Ginza an island?
5 Selected Trivia to Talk About While Polishing Silver (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
Here, you see, it used to be a peninsula long ago.
As evidence of that, being able to show off a bit of trivia like "..." is unique to Ginza.
Introducing interesting trivia about Ginza that you'll want to know and surely share with someone.
English: Going above Ginza ! ?
First Infiltration into Ginza
English: Walking around Ginza, you can find traces of its history engraved in the land, with unusual place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines scattered throughout the area.
Walking with her in Ginza, during a sudden silence, I said, "You know, this place used to be a peninsula long ago."
English: Was Ginza once a peninsula?
English: The symbol of bustling downtown districts throughout Japan, Ginza in Chuo Ward of Tokyo, which has created many "○○ Ginza" areas around the country.
To begin with, "Ginza" refers to a silver coin mint, and in 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza government office, which was located in present-day Shizuoka City, was relocated to Edo.
At that time, it was called "Shin-ryogae-machi," but when it moved to Kakigaramachi, it became known by the nickname "Ginza."
By the way, it is said that once upon a time, the area around Ginza was a "peninsula" that jutted out into the sea.
English: Before the Edo period, from Hibiya to Marunouchi, a bay extended inland, and from Nihonbashi to Ginza, a peninsula called "Edomaeshima" stretched out.
The tip of that peninsula corresponds to the present-day Ginza.
English: After Tokugawa Ieyasu established the shogunate in Edo, he reclaimed the inlet and advanced the development of the Kyobashi district.
Furthermore, Ieyasu improved the urban districts and developed water transportation by constructing moats and canals.
And by digging the moats and cutting down Kanda Mountain, they reclaimed the inlet.
Furthermore, near the front of the Tiffany Ginza main store (located at Chuo-ku Ginza 2-7), there is a stone monument indicating the former site of the Ginza town hall, titled "Birthplace of Ginza". If you're interested, why not try looking for it?
English: The "sacred pilgrimage" in Ginza, known only to those in the know
In Ginza, there is an event called "Ginza Haccho Shrine Tour," a little-known "sacred pilgrimage" held annually that only those in the know are aware of.
English: Among more than ten sacred sites, the most noticeable one is probably the "Kabuki Inari Shrine" located in front of the Kabukiza Theater.
At the shrine on the right end of the Kabuki-za theater, there are quite a few people who visit to pay their respects before and after watching the performance.
On the other hand, "Ryukomyo Fudo" is located on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuya, and "Ginza Shusse Jizo" is located on the 9th floor Ginza Terrace of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
The "Houdou Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", and "Toyonoi Inari Shrine" are located deep in the alleyways and are not very noticeable. However, the "Toyonoi Inari Shrine" is known for being revered by the famous Kabuki actor, Ichimura Uzaemon. On the other hand, the "Success Inari Shrine" located at the 1st floor entrance of the Shiseido Ginza building is not open to the public except during the Haccho Shrine Tour.
In this shrine tour, there are places that enshrine Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bosatsu, but most of the shrines have Inari as the main deity.
In front of the shrine hall, a fox welcomes you at the "Inari Shrine", which is believed to bring the benefits of a "bountiful harvest" of rice in areas with many farmers, and has been actively built.
English: Consequently, in large cities like Kyoto and Edo, it became said that there was a benefit of prosperous business, and in Ginza, the most bustling district in Japan, faith also spread.
What do you think of someone who goes home without getting vaccinated?

English: Man's body discovered in Shonai River in Moriyama Ward, Nagoya (Chukyo TV News) - Yahoo! News
English: Before noon on the 12th, a man was found dead, lying face down in the Shonai River in Moriyama Ward, Nagoya City.
The police are investigating the man's identity, cause of death, and other details.
According to the police, at around 11:30 AM on the 12th, a passerby found a man lying face down in the Shonai River in Nakashidami, Moriyama Ward, and called 110 to report it.
The man was rescued from the river, but he was confirmed dead on the spot.
The police are rushing to confirm the person's identity while also investigating the cause of death and other factors.

It seems that the confirmation documents will be sent starting from today...

South Korea's POSCO International acquires Australia's Senex Energy, expanding overseas gas field business - Korean reports (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Posco International announced on the 12th that it has entered into a share acquisition agreement with Australian Senex Energy and an investment agreement with Hancock Energy for the acquisition of Senex Energy.
Currently, the approval at the Senex Energy's shareholders' meeting and the approval of the local corporation are still pending, with the acquisition process expected to be completed in March next year.
This acquisition is the largest global merger and acquisition (M&A) case for POSCO International since its integration into the POSCO Group in 2010.
The acquisition amount is 770.9 billion won, with POSCO International investing 50.1% and Hancock Energy investing 49.9% respectively.
Posco International explained that they decided on this acquisition as the demand for natural gas continues to increase sustainably even in the era of energy transition, and in the hydrogen market, blue hydrogen based on natural gas is expected to split the market with green hydrogen.
English: With this acquisition, Posco International will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802 Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as onshore gas field operation personnel in Australia.

That knee pain, could it possibly be "Osteoarthritis of the knee" ! ?
Different treatments depending on the cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editing Department: Recently, I have been experiencing ongoing knee pain.
What kind of illnesses could there be?
Maruyama Sensei: The causes of knee pain can vary, including injuries, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, "osteoarthritis" is common in Japanese people.
Editing Department: Does this mean that the joints become deformed?
Maruyama Sensei: That's right.
Originally, the surfaces of joints are covered with cartilage, which serves to cushion impacts and ensure smooth joint movements.
However, factors such as aging, obesity, and intense sports can cause the cartilage to wear down or become distorted.
As a result, it leads to joint deformity and inflammation.
Editorial Department: Can osteoarthritis develop in joints other than the knee?
Maruyama Sensei: Yes.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints and bases of the fingers, neck, lower back, big toe, hip joint, and so on.
However, the most common cases occur in the knee, and it is called "degenerative knee arthritis."
Editorial Department: First of all, what kind of structure is a joint?
Maruyama Sensei: Joints are formed by the combination of two bones with uneven surfaces.
And, the parts where these two bones face each other are covered with "articular cartilage," and the area around the joint is wrapped in a "joint capsule."
Editorial Department: It's a complex structure, isn't it?
Maruyama-sensei: That's right, isn't it?
Inside the joint capsule, there is a tissue called the synovial membrane, which produces synovial fluid.
This synovial fluid serves as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
That is why it is said that "To make the movement of the knee smoother, hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good."
Editorial Department: When you develop osteoarthritis, what kind of symptoms occur?
Mr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage has both toughness and elasticity, playing a role in preventing bones from directly colliding with each other.
In a sense, it plays the role of a cushion.
However, if this becomes worn or distorted, it can cause joint deformity or inflammation, resulting in pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you sleep?
It's basic pajamas, but when my pajamas are being washed or something, I wear a tracksuit or something similar to sleep!
Even heavy smokers, there are people who can quit tobacco, and there are also people who cannot quit.
English: That's right, there are two types.
My acquaintance used to be a heavy smoker, but they have completely quit.
English: Somehow, they thought about quitting, and it seems they stopped right then.

Real Experience of "Kaiji" Series: 3 Selected Gambling & Games (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The gambling manga series "Kaiji" boasts explosive popularity, especially among men.
One of the highlights of this work is the extreme game where lives are at stake.
English: [Photo] Just looking at it makes your legs tremble... ... Challenging the steel beam crossing!
So this time, we would like to examine the games from Kaiji that can actually be played or have been put into practice in project videos.
English: "Swamp" is a trap-filled pachinko game that appeared in "Gambling Apocalypse Kaiji."
In the original work, the high rate of 4,000 yen per ball astonished Kaiji.
In this "swamp," there are large traps such as the "Forest of Nails," "Movable Props," and "3-Tier Croun," making conquering it almost impossible.
However, using every possible method, Kaiji ultimately resorted to the extreme measure of placing a vinyl water tank on the building, causing the ground to sink and tilt, and successfully captured it.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually made an appearance as a pachinko game, and many people have played it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4,000 yen per ball," and the difficulty has been lowered, but you can still experience the feeling of Kaiji.
English: At the "Star Side Party" held by a wealthy person for entertainment, the debtors, including Kaiji, participated in the "Human Horse Race" which involved crossing steel beams.
The debtor advances on a narrow steel frame set 10 meters above the ground, devising a way not to fall, and competes in speed.
12 people participate, and the top 2 can win a prize, but there are only 4 iron bars and safety measures are insufficient, so the possibility of death is quite high.
This steel beam crossing is highly dangerous, but it has been developed as a VR game, and a very similar experience can be had at the "Eagle Bridge" located at the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles' home stadium "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi."
This Eagle Bridge has a steel bridge at a height of 20 meters (equivalent to the 7th floor of a building), and beyond that, the "Sky Blanco" and the "Bridge of Victory" are prepared, which you walk towards.
Of course, safety measures have been implemented.
Comedian Koala Kozu released a video on his own YouTube channel, where he walks across the Eagle Bridge, claiming that "you can experience crossing steel beams in Japan," and it became a hot topic.
English: "E-Card" 2-player card game, "E-Card".
Using a total of 10 cards, including 1 Emperor card, 8 Citizen cards, and 1 Slave card, the game is played by dividing into two sides: Emperor and Slave.
This game is very well made, and it has the characteristic where the emperor is strong against the citizens, the citizens are strong against the slaves, and the slaves are strong against the emperor.
In the story, Kaiji competes against Tonegawa under the strict rule that "if he loses, his own ear will be cut off."
After a great struggle, Kaiji realized that his mind was being read through a device attached to his ear like earphones, which sensed and transmitted changes in his pulse and body temperature. By shaving his ears to the extreme and causing his body to generate abnormal values, he managed to confuse Tonegawa and achieve victory.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased on platforms like Amazon.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video where he competes in an E-Card battle with Tatsuya Fujiwara, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, and it has generated a lot of buzz.
English: How about experiencing the Kaiji mood?
Nobody wants to be in a situation like Kaiji, but it is true that when you read the manga, you may feel like experiencing the mood at least.
How about experiencing the game's world view through playing it?
A Gentle Push towards the New Year: A Large Toranoe-uma at the Prefectural Gokoku Shrine｜Yamagata Newspaper
At the Ken Gokoku Shrine (Yamagata City), where preparations for the New Year are underway, a large ema (wooden plaque) featuring next year's zodiac sign, the Tiger (tora), has appeared.
On the 11th, students from Tohoku University of Art and Design, who designed the shrine, visited it and a ceremonial offering was held in front of the deity.
The shrine has been commissioning art university students to create the original drawings for votive tablets since the year before last.
This time, from the 9 works created by students in the Japanese Painting course led by Professor Toshiaki Suenaga, the artwork of Yui Tsuchiya (22), a third-year student, was adopted.
The large ema has a width of 3.3 meters, and the height at the center is approximately 1.8 meters.
Tsuchiya-san said that they drew it with an image of "cherry blossoms gently pushing your back as you step into the new year."
Stopping and gazing at the cherry blossoms, the figure of the tiger embodies the wish "to be able to appreciate the beauty of nature even in a rapidly changing world."
Tsuchiya-san's design can also be seen on the Ema, which are distributed to the public.
Chiba Kenichi (44), a Gonnegi, said, "I believe it will help everyone overcome their difficulties."

English: "Thinking about 'Tamano, the City We Want to Keep Living In': 4 High School Students in the City Workshop Propose Ideas: Sanyo Shimbun Digital | San-digi
English: What kind of town is Tamano in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are working together on a workshop to think about "Tamano, where they want to continue living."
As part of the research and policy recommendation project by the intermediate support organization "Tamano SDGs Future Creation Center", they compile the raw voices of young people and present suggestions to the mayor and others.
"When is it fun?"
In response to the facilitator's question, the students answer in chorus, "When getting excited with many people," "When playing the drums," and so on.
English: The first meeting was held at Hinode Fureai Hall on November 13th.
English: A total of 18 high school students and local residents discussed their ideas about creating an "interesting town", a "comfortable town", and a "town with a sense of purpose" through the method of a "World Café", in which they moved between designated "islands" with specific themes.
Write down each idea on sticky notes, and organize them on poster paper.
"Young people make the town more interesting." "Convenient transportation like trains and buses is essential for a comfortable living."
There is no common ground, let's discuss further.
"Although I thought Tamano was boring, the charm of being able to cycle along the seaside is appealing," says an 18-year-old third-year student at Tamano Commercial High School.
A 18-year-old third-year student at Binan High School said, "There are few shops and the transportation is inconvenient, but the abundant nature is nice." They were talking with adults, and it seemed that they not only noticed the regional issues but also the attractions.
In the second meeting of December, high school students gather and organize the content of their proposals.
In February next year, there are plans to hold a presentation with the invitation of the Mayor, the Superintendent of Education, and others.
East Rie, the director of the center, said, "We hope to nurture high school students' love for their hometown and provide an opportunity for young people to actively engage in community development."

English: How to find a new way to wrap a stole (Sankei Newspaper) - Yahoo! News
In winter, stoles are essential, but don't you sometimes find the fabric bunching up around your neck?
After wrapping, it's good to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror, but sometimes I hear people say they don't quite understand the trick.
If only there was a stole that could be wrapped quickly without the fabric bunching up...I thought, and then I found an innovative one.
The "COTTORI" brand scarf has a long side of about 1 meter, making it a more compact size than typical scarves.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Can I really roll it up with it being this short?"
Upon closer inspection, the fabric is made from long, narrow strips that are woven together to form a single piece, creating a net-like pattern throughout.
In the mesh, the ends of the stole can be passed through.
Therefore, even without tying the ends together, it is possible to roll and secure them.
The fleece material is very lightweight and warm.
This year, sleeveless jackets, also known as vests or waistcoats, are popular, and many people wear them with a stole to keep their shoulders warm.
Having a stole like this, I am sure it would be convenient.
English: (Stylist Junko Ishida)
The Beatles documentary on Disney Plus is super interesting.
English: It's the one called Get Buck, directed by Peter Jackson.
It feels fresh in various ways, like a lifelike or life-sized Beatles, so to speak.
English: Since it's just before disbanding, there is tension, but it's not the dramatic tension that I had imagined.
While trying their best to manage, there's the annoying Paul who's like "I know I'm annoying, but come on!" and the slightly whiny George who says "But, you know~", and John who, despite calmly making opinions and jokes, is always late and doesn't seem motivated... Even Ringo, the peacemaker, doesn't actively speak up, and sits in the back with a "What a bother" expression on his face.
English: It's like, we don't hate each other enough to fight, but there's this very relatable feeling of "well, it's probably impossible to work together anymore," and it's interesting that the Beatles were like that as well, like the dismantling of a legend or something like that.
And, even in such an atmosphere, when the performance begins, everyone is truly overflowing with talent.
English: The process of turning small phrases into "that masterpiece" as we both suggest "how about this?" to each other is amazing.
The moment when "Get Buck," the title track, is completed is amazing.
English: It's amazing how the casual humming gradually turns into that "zucha♪zucha♪" sound and the scene where lyrics are added is well-recorded.
It's amazing to be able to see the process of composing music like this, as it's not something you usually get to see.
Well, it's obvious, but everyone is really into it, so just watching the performance scenes makes me happy.
It seems to be only the first episode out of three, but so far, the impression is that the main reason for The Beatles' breakup was not so much the band itself, but the environment around them.
English: Although the four members seem to have fun creating music while complaining about various things, when it comes to deciding the venue for the live performance, producers and promotional staff start saying things like "Of course, the Beatles are the best in the world!" with enthusiasm, and it becomes clear that the matter is no longer in the hands of the members themselves.
Well, documentaries also involve the director's interpretation, so it might be showing what Peter Jackson felt...
I thought that the reason there are many scenes where Paul seems to be a relatively bad guy might be because Paul is supervising it.

I used to work in a sales position, but I was so mentally exhausted that I changed jobs. At that time, I realized that I was not good at initiating sales activities on my own, but I was well-suited for sales activities when customers expressed their needs. So, I chose to work in a different industry with that kind of job, and it has become much easier for me to work.

Of course, I think it's fine to think about this after taking a break and having some peace of mind.
I think there is also just everyday life, so if there are company unions, occupational doctors, or consultation windows, it might be a good idea to consult them as there may be some kind of system in place.
It would be nice if we can live with a little more comfortable feeling from now on.

In the United States, numerous tornadoes cause significant damage due to unseasonal warmth and strong cold air influence (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
English: From the night of the 10th (Fri) to the 11th (Sat) local time, numerous tornadoes occurred mainly in the southern United States.
At this time, due to the record-breaking warmth and the strong cold air moving southward, the atmospheric conditions became extremely unstable, and it is believed that cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly.
In the southern United States, warm air from the southwest flowed in, resulting in record high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the highest temperatures on the 9th (Thursday) and 10th (Friday) local time are reaching nearly 30℃.
In such record-breaking warmth, strong cold air of below -30℃ came down from the upper atmosphere around 5500m, resulting in the formation of an active front due to the large temperature difference. Cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed along the front.
It is believed that tornadoes occurred one after another in the surrounding area.
The southern United States is originally a region prone to tornadoes, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases where significant damage occurs during this period.
In winter, the number of tornado warnings issued in a single day reached nearly 150, which was a record high.
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration received over 400 reports of tornadoes and gusts of wind on the 10th (Friday) local time.
According to this, there are two main concentrated areas: the southern line from Kentucky to Texas, and the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, the strength of the tornado reached EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF Scale), which is the third strongest out of six levels. It is believed that gusts of around 70 meters per second occurred momentarily.
Depending on future investigations, there is a possibility that it may be determined as EF4-5.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the Modified Fujita Scale) is used, which is adapted to the conditions of Japanese buildings based on the original Modified Fujita Scale.
This time, the equivalent of the American tornado JEF3 has a sufficient possibility of occurring in Japan, and it is at a level where wooden houses would collapse.

US Tornado "Largest in History": Voices seeking help from under debris during live broadcast (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo! News
Regarding the tornado damage in the Midwest and Southern United States, President Biden expressed his view with a solemn expression on the 11th (Japanese time 12th), calling it "one of the largest tornadoes in US history."
English: As reported by US CNN TV and others.
Mr. Biden emphasized, "We will do everything as the federal government."
"The full extent of the damage, such as the number of lives lost, is still unknown," explained.
The number of deaths is feared to exceed 100.
[Photo] In Kentucky, where tornado damage has occurred, residents carry household goods and other items from damaged houses. From the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least six states, including Kentucky.
The record for the range of tornado damage is 219 miles (about 350 kilometers), which was caused in 1925 in Missouri and other areas. However, a weather expert from CNN has estimated that this time it reached approximately 250 miles (about 400 kilometers), making it the largest scale on record.
In Mayfield, Kentucky, which suffered major damage, a candle factory that was likely operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas shopping season also sustained severe damage.
At that time, 110 people were working there, but the building was destroyed and there was no trace left.
In the darkness, a woman who was unable to move under debris about 1.5 meters thick felt the weight of rescue workers searching on top of the rubble, and called for help through a live broadcast on Facebook from her smartphone.
In the public live broadcast, in addition to the cries of a woman calling for help, there were screams and the singing of "Happy Birthday to You," which is believed to have been sung by another woman crying in order to distract herself from the fear.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk living in Mayfield, took cover in her basement with her 5-year-old son due to a tornado warning and was safe.
Many people compare it to the sound of a train, but looking back, it was a more terrifying noise, like the rumble of something bursting out of the ground.
Mayfield City police officers said, "Search activities will continue until they are no longer necessary.
"It is unclear how many weeks, months, or years it will take, but we will continue our diligent rescue efforts."
In Illinois, a partial collapse of an Amazon warehouse, a major internet retailer, has been confirmed, resulting in at least 6 deaths.
The impact was strong enough to detach train cars and cause derailment, and the highways are also being successively closed due to the effects of vehicle overturning.
According to US web media, approximately 400,000 households, including 130,000 in Tennessee, are experiencing power outages.

Living on welfare is tough, isn't it...
I'm praying that somehow it can be done.
It would be nice if there were "live-in job openings" like inns and resort part-time jobs, where both an address and source of income could be secured, but with the current social situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it seems like there would be fewer options.
Well, I tried googling it and found a site like this↓.
Live-in Part-time and Full-time Job - Live-in Job Recruitment Navi (SumiNavi)
In the related searches, there is "a job with a catch, live-in position", so it seems like there are many people like that among my colleagues.
English: It seems like having an address for the first time is enough for bank accounts and line contracts, but credit cards (and debit cards that can be treated as credit cards) cannot be renewed without an address (since the new card is sent to the registered address).
What does it mean to be a specialist doctor in gynecology?
A "specialist doctor" is a doctor who is 3 to 5 years after graduation.
English: They are also called "specialist doctors" and "postgraduate trainee doctors."
The so-called "trainee doctor" refers to the "initial trainee doctor," which means a doctor in their first or second year after graduation.
Although it can be considered inexperienced, by the 4th or 5th year, one becomes capable of performing a certain level of medical treatment, and thus, is entrusted with various tasks.

There has been a saying since ancient times that people have different opinions on the star-rating system.
The claim is that while other countries use a 5-star rating as a standard and deduct points from there, Japan considers a 3-star rating as neutral and adds or deducts points accordingly.
At the reference point, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars have completely different meanings in terms of "having a negative element" and "not a masterpiece but a good work".
If we base it on a 5-star standard, "works without flaws" and "works with the highest level in every aspect" would be treated as equal, and if there is such a tendency, I would think that it's a flaw in the system that doesn't present the meaning of the stars. However, since it is a system that is currently being operated in such a way, I understand that you are saying you would like us not to give 3 stars (negative reviews).
That's why when trying to argue with people who advocate for this kind of argument using Steam's 2-choice review system, the conversation doesn't mesh well.

Is there an underwater pump available that can accommodate a standard hose size and be powered by USB?
The power capacity that can be obtained from a USB is approximately up to 2A at 5V, so it is at most 10W.

Homemade Radio Story
I made an AM radio with homemade capacitors and coils, but there was a lot of noise and it couldn't be heard clearly.
English: I could hear the sound of the radio, but I heard a different radio station than the frequency I had tuned to.
There is a possibility that the tuning was not tight enough and the sound was unclear, but it was different from the expected station.
So, the main point here is that I was supposed to make an AM radio, but it seems like I can hear FM radio.
Why do you think that is? I wonder if such a thing is possible?
Can I delete the Esp files from SMIM and Dlizzio's Mesh Fixes?
If a mod using ESP for distributing textures and meshes deploys the Lose files in the appropriate position, it is not necessary to have ESP.
English: I vaguely remember seeing a story about that somewhere, but I can't recall where I saw it…
I understand the risks, so I don't actually plan to do it, but I can't sleep at night because I'm worried about it.
I would like to know if it is technically possible.
If there is anyone who remembers, please let me know if it is okay to do it.
Thank you for your submission.

Saga Food Diaries: "Hakobune's" "Seasonal Local Fish Fry and Shrimp Fry with Homemade Tartar Sauce" | Lifestyle & Culture | Saga Newspaper News | Saga Newspaper LiVE
English: "Bento: Seasonal fish fry and shrimp fry caught in nearby waters, with homemade tartar sauce"
The takeout specialty store "hakobune" offers colorful bento boxes and deli dishes packed with an abundance of vegetables.
"In order to let people enjoy the atmosphere of a restaurant even at home," Mr. Takayuki Katsuki (39) and Mrs. Yumi (38) opened their business in August last year.
One of the popular lunch box menus is "Seasonal fish fry and shrimp fry caught in nearby waters, with homemade tartar sauce" (1,000 yen).
Choose the best fish available at the market at any given time.
"Regarding the [coating for] fried dishes, we make sure to keep the breadcrumbs as thin as possible so that the texture of the ingredients can be understood," says Mr. Yoshiyuki. As a result, the shrimp tempura has a plump and direct texture that is easy to recognize.
In the lunch box, there are about 4 types of side vegetables and deli, mixed grain rice with Saga prefecture's Hinohikari rice, and a serving of soup.
Vegetables are homemade from the nearby fields and purchased at local direct sales outlets in the prefecture.
The side dishes may change depending on the season, but Mr. Kiyuki has trained in French cuisine, and dishes such as carpaccio and ratatouille add a touch of color.
On the other hand, they have created a fusion of Japanese and Western cuisine that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations, with familiar and comforting flavors like dashimaki tamago (rolling omelette) according to Ms. Yumi.
The lunch box "Handmade Hamburger with Domestic Ground Meat" (1,000 yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, they will also launch "charcuterie sets," processed meat products that go well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

English: I happened to stop by Haneda Airport and found something interesting, so I tried using it.
The ride comfort is not that bad, but it occasionally sways (not enough to cause motion sickness).
Speed is naturally slow
Safety: When there are people around, it slows down and even stops completely depending on the situation, so I think it's generally safe. However, there are some locations where I thought it could be dangerous.
English: The stares around me hurt. It's okay to be seen, but being seen as if I'm a nuisance, it hurts my heart.
Overall, it's not bad, but there's still room for improvement.
It's a shame that it would be easier to use if there were a little fewer people, or if there were considerations such as moving to the edge.
Specifically, I thought it would be a good idea to create dedicated lanes so as not to obstruct other pedestrians walking around.
However, since it's a laid-back experience and you can enjoy the scenery at a slow pace, I think it would be a better means of transportation if there were fewer people.
In the future, I wonder if autonomous driving like this will become mainstream, as it has an exciting sense of the near future, and the slight discomfort from the gazes of people around me feels good. It's a challenging vehicle to ride unless you have a considerably strong and patient mindset.
It was so embarrassing

English: Around 1:25 a.m. on the 12th, a man in his 40s from Fukuoka Prefecture was slashed with a bladed weapon by a man believed to be in his 30s to 40s on a street in Okutomi 1-chome, Saga City, resulting in injuries to his face.
The man escaped on a motorcycle, and the Saga Minami Police Station is pursuing his whereabouts in connection with an attempted murder case.
According to the south police station, there was a 911 call reporting a fight going on from a passerby.
The man sustained an injury about 10 centimeters long and about 1 centimeter deep on his left cheek, but he is still conscious.
The man who escaped was of medium build and had a shaved head.
A bladed weapon believed to have been used in the crime was found near the scene.
The man was drinking with several acquaintances, and it is being investigated whether there was some kind of traffic trouble between the male pedestrian and the man on the bike.

The long journey of a family who rooted environmental protection activities in the Chinese border region (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Kato Yuki: Hong Kong company Find Asia corporate consultant) China, with its vast land, is important in terms of biodiversity and has the highest number of mammal species in the world and ranks third in the number of plant species.
In some local governments, they recognize the value of biodiversity, and not only promote environmental protection carried out by the local government, but also support the activities of environmental activists in the area.
Yunnan Province's Xishuangbanna, located in southwestern China, is one of such regions.
English: My sister Ri Wanda is currently active as an actress. Sisapan is a region that borders both Laos and Myanmar and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the Dai (Thai) people who share their roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand.
The Mekong River flows through Southeast Asian countries, originating from its source.
English: The Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture (also known as Sipsongpanna) covers only about 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to approximately 25% of the country's wild animal species and 20% of its plant species.
This time, we had the opportunity to meet with Lệ Minh Quả, who is engaged in environmental protection activities at Shisapan, and hear about the content of their activities on location.
English: Started environmental protection activities with a German husband - It has been 20 years since the beginning of environmental protection activities.
What was the cause of that?
English: Mr./Ms. Ri, our environmental conservation activity "Tenseed" has started since 2000.
The catalyst for that is my husband, Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and came to Sihanoukville for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
This is the only tropical rainforest region in China, boasting a remarkable biodiversity.
However, on the other hand, economic development was also lagging behind.
Therefore, in order to establish industries in this region and to produce rubber that was in short supply within China, large-scale deforestation of tropical rainforests was previously carried out.
My husband was dispatched from Germany to work on the recovery of natural resources and research of biological resources here.
And then, I met and married the person who was working as a journalist here.
English: ― ― Before that, wasn't Mr. Lee not interested in nature conservation?
English: Mr./Ms. Ri, I am from Si Sa Panna, but I was not interested in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
English: As a result, I ended up promoting the project with my husband without having that knowledge.
Sometimes I see people who have an aura even though they don't have a perfectly symmetrical face or an exceptionally tall stature. Why do you think that is?

Aura is not something that comes out when you think it will.

That person must have a strong inner confidence, right?

【Personal Memo/Environment】The cause of CTD in the MOD self-environment, which took about a month and a half to identify.
English: Until March, there was stable data, but from around Golden Week, I couldn't find much time to play due to multiple factors causing CTDs (Crash to Desktop). I mainly checked on holidays, and it took a long time to identify the problem.
Why didn't you analyze the log with the .Net Script Framework (it would probably only take a few minutes)? Some errors related to .dll files and meshes do not leave traces in the crash log.
Main CTD Timing
English: * Leave no traces in the logs of all Papyrus, .Net Script Framework, and log-keeping type .dll plug-ins.
English: * When killing/attacking some NPCs: Activates with console kill → Improvement with Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in / powerofthree's SE update resumed version) OFF ※ There might be a possibility of false accusation regarding this?
English: * The camera work during kill move activation against some NPCs can be basically improved by turning off the kill move setting for PC through the .ini file, which might be due to the setting conflict between DAR and Nemesis. However, the number of DAR animations doesn't even reach the upper limit of 10,000.
English: * (Basic outdoor) Field movement + some magic (e.g., Freezing Rune) activation, when hitting an NPC: Apply Dirt & Blood v 2.0's SPID settings to NPCs (top right of MCM) with all options turned OFF for 5 consecutive attempts, resulting in improvements for each trial.
English: Could it be due to additional armor and body mesh shader settings for some actor/NPC wear? Furthermore, although there are format errors in the default .ini file for 2.0 SPID usage, the intended result should still be achieved with prerequisite perks being applied to NPCs.
At first, I mainly focused on checking the false accusations related to targeted body part attacks and OnHit-related motions/combat MODs (.dll ones), and this is the result I got.

Thoughts on the importance of psychiatric home-visit nursing - Today's home-visit nursing is over
I have been receiving home nursing care for a long time due to my bipolar disorder, and I believe I have built a very good relationship with the female nurse at the home nursing station I am currently using, as our association has been ongoing for a while.
Every week, we talk about various topics.
Of course, they do the necessary medication management (such as unit dosing), but what struck me the most during today's home nursing visit is how important enjoyable communication is for people with mental illnesses.
Today, we had a casual chat, or rather a discussion, about gender differences and gender theory, lol.
Discussions about things like male and female sexual desire, why she got divorced, and whether it's okay to talk about such topics during a home care visit also take place.
Occasionally, I also dress as a woman.
However, in the case of visiting nursing stations run by psychiatric hospitals, I have heard from an acquaintance that retired nurses who can no longer work in hospital wards may come and only provide administrative support, or occupational therapists may come for home visits and give instructions with a condescending attitude, saying things like "We are the ones providing medical care here."
I am using a small visiting nurse station run by a social welfare corporation, and I think they are truly excellent nurses who treat me equally and frankly, even with my mental illness.
By the way, she's beautiful lol.
There may be people who are receiving psychiatric home nursing care, and there may be those who are considering receiving it.
Visiting nursing care is very beneficial for people with mental illnesses.
If the doctor approves, let's definitely go for it.
And, let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, there was a time when I just couldn't get along with someone, so I had to cancel the contract from my side.

South Korea's hydrogen technology patents, one-fifth of China's... "Delay in fulfilling the hydrogen economy roadmap" (JoongAng Ilbo Japanese Edition) - Yahoo! News
The South Korean government announced the Hydrogen Economy Roadmap in 2019.
By 2022, the plan was to popularize 65,000 fuel cell vehicles (cumulative) and operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target hydrogen price is set at 6,000 won (approximately 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, as of November this year, the number of fuel cell vehicles is only at 27% of the target level (about 17,000 units).
The proliferation schedule of hydrogen stations for core infrastructure is at 38% of the goal (approximately 117 locations), and the price of hydrogen per kilometer is also not much different from the time the roadmap was announced, at 8,400 won.
It was found that the government's progress on the hydrogen economy roadmap is significantly below the target value.
On the 12th, the Japan Business Federation (Keidanren) announced a report titled "Current Status and Policy Direction of the Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem."
According to the report, the reality is that the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on countries like the United States and Japan.
The core materials for fuel cell vehicles, such as carbon fiber, are supplied by Toray (Japan), platinum catalyst by Kyocera (Japan), and membrane film by DuPont (United States), Gore (United States), and 3M (United States).
The number of hydrogen technology patents held by the six leading countries in the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) is increasing at an average annual rate of 14% since 2014.
In the field of hydrogen production and fuel cell patents, South Korea ranks 5th in the world for the cumulative total from 2014 to 2020.
However, the Keizai Doyukai reported that "in practice, the six countries essentially occupy the majority of the global hydrogen market, meaning that they are actually at the bottom among the competing nations."
The ranking of patents by country is China, the United States, the EU, and Japan, in that order.
Since 2017, China has surpassed the United States to become the number one ranked and has been widening the gap ever since.
In 2020, the number of registered patents in South Korea was 1,033, surpassing Japan (974 patents) to become 4th place, but it was only 22% of China's level (4,721 patents).
The All Japan Federation of Management Organizations (Zenkeiren) proposed that "hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'national strategic technology' with a large tax deduction for facility investment and research and development costs."

US aid weapons and ammunition arrive in Ukraine; engaged in troop training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) According to a US State Department official on the 12th, equipment including small arms and ammunition arrived in Ukraine based on the security assistance plan approved by President Biden.
Military aid amounts to a total of 60 million dollars (approximately 6.8 billion yen), and by the beginning of the new year, the final equipment, including 4 radar units capable of identifying the launch locations of mortars and other weapons, will be transported to Ukraine.
According to the spokesperson for the United States Department of Defense, Kirby, the assistance included lethal weapons such as anti-tank missiles, "Javelin."
The purpose of military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities in response to the Russian military's troop buildup and other activities near the Ukraine border.
The US is increasing its vigilance towards the movements of the Russian military, consulting with NATO member countries, and is also preparing response measures in case Russia takes the step to invade Ukraine.
President Biden approved military assistance when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House on September 1st this year.
The U.S. military support to Ukraine has reached approximately $450 million this year.
After Russia forcibly annexed the Crimea Peninsula of Ukraine, the total amount of aid exceeded 2.5 billion dollars.
The U.S. military is also engaged in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, US National Guard troops from Florida were dispatched in accordance with a multinational joint training plan to support Ukraine.
According to a statement from the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Special Operations Forces in Europe have also played a significant role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of U.S. special forces operating within Ukraine is not disclosed due to operational confidentiality.
President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Putin on the 7th of this month, but tense exchanges took place regarding the situation in Ukraine.
In the event of an invasion, the United States is also showing a readiness to impose strict economic sanctions.

The future of inheritance and gift tax "revision" that prohibits lifetime gifts, directly confronting Amari Akira, former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party Tax Council!
The first feature of the December 18 issue of "Weekly Diamond" is "Talk with your family during the year-end and New Year holidays!"
English: "Lifetime Gift and Last-Minute Inheritance Techniques."
English: While discussions on the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax are progressing, the anticipated 2022 tax reform outline did not include it. However, there is a high possibility that the lifeline of inheritance tax measures, the living gift, may become "forbidden" in the near future.
How will the inheritance rules change?
English: Along with the direct impact on former Liberal Democratic Party Tax Committee Chairman and House of Representatives member Akira Amari, we will thoroughly teach you everything from the basics of gifts and inheritance to tax-saving techniques for valuable last-minute gift-giving that will make it in time for the end of the year.
English: (Diamond Editorial Department, Hiroaki Miyahara)
English: From wealthy individuals to urban office workers, the utilization of lifetime gifts as a "forbidden move" is being considered. "In order to build a neutral tax system for the timing of asset transfers, we will proceed with a thorough examination from the perspective of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax in a more integrated manner."
In one of the articles of the 2021 tax reform outline announced by the ruling party last year, there was a significant unrest spread not only among the wealthy but also the middle class.
English: That's because what they're trying to say is that they aim to drastically increase inheritance taxes by completely changing the rules of inheritance, and making "lifetime gifts," the main strategy for inheritance tax avoidance, a "forbidden move."
The golden rule of tax-saving measures for highly progressive inheritance tax is "to reduce the taxable property."
That strongest trump card, the lifetime gift, has been widely used not only by wealthy individuals but also by company employees who have a small amount of inheritance tax due to owning a home in the three major metropolitan areas.
In the midst of all this, the unexpected discussion on "unifying inheritance tax and gift tax" emerged.
Although the fastest introduction was a concern and was postponed in the outline of the tax reform for the fiscal year 2022 announced on December 10th, the policy toward integration was re-emphasized with more detailed wording, such as "reviewing the current inheritance tax calculation system and the calendar year gift system" and "the non-taxable measures for gift tax do not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limit (omission) and will be continuously reviewed."
In an interview with our editorial department, former Secretary-General and former Chairman of the Tax Commission of the Liberal Democratic Party, Akira Amari, said.
"It is most important to eliminate the advantages and disadvantages depending on the timing of property transfers, and to make the tax burden the same whenever it is done."
Currently, we are simulating what kind of issues will arise from integration. If the amendment is made as quickly as possible, there will be three remaining opportunities for lifetime gifts.
Even if that's not the case, it seems certain that in the near future, a major shift will be made towards invalidating lifetime gifts as a tax-saving measure.
Then, how do the inheritance tax and gift tax rules specifically change?

English: "My Righteous Brother" will be broadcasted on terrestrial TV from January 10, 2022. Yudai Furukawa says, "Please look forward to it!"
It has been decided that the FOD original drama "My Righteous Brother," starring Yuta Furukawa, will be broadcasted on Fuji TV from January 10, 2022, late-night.
[Photo] Heroine role played by Kanon Yamaya. Since 2018, this original work has been adapted from the comic of the same name by Satoshi Morie, serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE". The story is a heart-wrenchingly pure love story between a man and a woman burdened by their pasts.
The protagonist Kairi is played by Furukawa, while the heroine Rie is portrayed by Yamatani Hanazumi.
University student Rie meets her part-time job senior, Kairi.
Every day, troubled by insomnia, Hikari is a mysterious young man who, for some reason, can sleep soundly when he borrows Rie's shoulder.
Rie becomes attracted to Kairi, who resembles her long-lost brother due to their parents' divorce. However, at some point, she begins to wonder if Kairi might be a murderer.
English: Yudai Furukawa's comment: The drama "My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial channels starting January 10th!
For those who were unable to watch it on FOD, I hope you'll look forward to it. And for those who have already seen it, I believe that watching the complex emotional portrayals and conflicts of Kairi and Rie, as well as the changes in their relationship, will allow you to gain a deeper understanding of this work.
I would be happy if fans of the original work can enjoy it as well.
Please look forward to it!

English: 【NFL】Team that won with 3 passes in a single game - What were the players feeling and how did they experience it? (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
In this game, Jones threw only 3 passes for the Patriots.
In the past 50 years of the NFL, this was the lowest number of passes since the 2 passes recorded by the Bills in week 3 of 1974 against the New York Jets.
In the 1974 Bills, there was an extraordinary genius running back, O.J. Simpson, who had surpassed 2,000 yards for the first time in history in the previous season.
English: The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with runs by Simpson and another RB, Jim Braxton.
This time, the main reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border, and its latitude is similar to Kushiro in Hokkaido.
And on this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, with strong winds blowing at 18 meters per second, and it was snowing heavily before the match.
English: As expected of the local team, the Bills did not change their play selection much.
For 30 passes, there are 25 runs.
Allen's pass is 15/30, 145 yards.
English: There was no interception, and it certainly wasn't a failure.
In the 10 offensive series, they entered the red zone 4 times, and had scoring opportunities.
Especially after the latter part of the 3rd quarter, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, in those three attempts, they were only able to score 3 points from one field goal.
Final stage of the match, defense in front of the goal.
The Bills, trailing by 4 points, committed a penalty on 3rd & 9, making it 3rd & 14.
The goal is 18 yards away.
On 3rd & 14, QB Allen was surrounded by the Patriots defense rush, moved out of the pocket, and drifted to the right.
And he aimed for TE Dawson Knox in the end zone and threw a pass, but it failed.
In this play, ace WR Stefon Diggs, who was on the right outside, ran a shallow cross and was free in front of the end zone, but it seems that he did not catch Allen's eye.
English: On 4th and 18, Allen targeted WR Gabriel Davis who ran into the end zone from the left outside, but the pass was knocked down by Patriots DB Myles Bryant, resulting in a failed attempt.
English: Bryant was covering Bills' WR Cole Beasley man-to-man, but he let go of Beasley midway as he saw Allen's movement, and responded to the pass.
Allen, who overlooked two receivers, threw passes targeting the end zone twice.
The 4th down pass might have been a predetermined play, but there was no need to aim for a touchdown on the 3rd down.
In order to get a first down, you need to make two plays.
Since it was still 2 minutes before, if they had made it 4th & short, Allen's ability to run himself should have come into play.

English: It's almost time for "disposing" & "replacing" these 3 long-term kitchen items often left out (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News
Sponge
No matter how often we change it, the sponge is probably not replaced as frequently as recommended.
From a 2017 study, it has been found that even if kitchen sponges are sterilized in the microwave every day, a large number of bacteria still multiply (however, it is still recommended to sterilize them in the microwave).
The German researchers who conducted this study recommend replacing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
Cutting board
The United States Department of Agriculture suggests that cutting boards should be replaced when they start to wear out, and develop scratches or grooves.
Once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, and bacteria can multiply.
If you are still okay, don't forget to frequently disinfect with a solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in 1 gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Immerse the surface of the cutting board in liquid and leave it for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and let it dry naturally, or gently pat dry with a clean paper towel.
Chipped or cracked tableware
It may be painful to dispose of your favorite mug, but the chipped surface can become a new breeding ground for bacteria and germs.
Moreover, the missing part can also cause cuts on the lips and spillage of drinks.
Yes, it's a chance to buy a new favorite mug!

English: "Yo!"
"Because it's a promise, right?"

Saying that, Yoshimasa went home.

Help, FlashBIOS doesn't finish
I bought a Ryzen 7 5800X, so I replaced the B550 and Tomahawk that I bought in September.
I once reached the BIOS settings screen, but after saving the settings and restarting, the screen became black with a white cursor-like dot that doesn't blink and remains stuck in that state.
I thought the BIOS might be corrupted, so I tried to rewrite it using FlashBIOS, but it never finishes.
According to MSI's blog, it seems to finish in about 5 minutes, but it doesn't end even in an hour.
The possible causes could be that the USB memory stick tested is too old or due to using a converter to use an SD card.
English: Slept too much and wondering if my phone is broken

For some reason, having branded items is embarrassing.
If it's something inconspicuous, I can carry it, but I can't carry items like Vuitton that have a bold monogram and "LV" written on them.
Why is that?
I think it's best to choose something that suits your own capacity.
By the way, I think it would be good if it's in Japan.
In Japan, it is.
It doesn't matter if it's foreign style or not.
It's better to say it sooner, "Why am I the only one being called without honorifics/talked to casually?"
So, if it becomes like "it doesn't matter because they are a foreigner?", it's better to simply say that it makes you uncomfortable.
English: I think there's a fair probability that they are feeling uncomfortable, but it's beyond my imagination.
English: I used to live abroad for a while and I noticed that many Japanese people, including myself, who went abroad disliked the Confucian hierarchical customs and came to live there. Some of us seemed to misunderstand that we could say anything to the locals once we were out of that environment.
If they look like Westerners, I think they are doing so without any ill will, but rather with a certain sense of indulgence or friendly feeling.
English: Although I call my friends from Europe and America by their first names, sometimes I get a little confused about which name to use when speaking Japanese.
Well, it's still fine if we're just friends.
Originally, they might just be doing it normally and purely, but if you overlook it, there might be no stopping the exceptional treatment being handled as "because they're a foreigner." So it's better to say something now while you can.
Can you speak according to Japanese rules since we are in Japan?
Editing: Although it's unrelated, my Caucasian friend who is naturalized always raises his glass higher than others who are younger than him when toasting at drinking parties.
Without a doubt, I'm aware of it, but I think it's a good habit because when I act that way, I'm not treated strangely or looked down upon by both younger and older people, or rather, I'm treated like a Japanese person.
English: Regardless of their personality, there are Japanese people (including me) who pay attention to such small details.

English: Today when I opened Reddit, I saw that this newly created subreddit had already surpassed 50 subscribers.
I'm extremely happy.
Thank you to everyone who has subscribed!
Actually, as of yesterday the number of subscribers was 25, so I thought it would take a bit more time to reach 50, but for some reason, 25 people subscribed just today, so I'm really grateful.

Well, just let it go with the flow!
I only have the ability to understand a little bit of English, so I will judge based on the translated text alone.
The translated text feels a bit awkward in sentences, but I can understand what it's trying to convey, and I think it's at a level where it doesn't hinder playing the game (this is just how I feel, so I think it would be better to ask other people as well).
In games produced overseas, I often see translations of this level, and if it's a small company, I think it's translated quite well.
I think whether or not a non-native Japanese speaker can understand the subtle nuances of the Japanese language depends on if they study it for a long period of time.
I am not sure what level of proficiency you are looking for, but if you are seeking a level that Japanese people would not feel uncomfortable with, it might be a good idea to look for someone else.

English: Analysis - "Demon Slayer" training is the real battle.
English: "Equivalent Exchange of Effort" is a human ode ＜Anime "Red-light District Arc" Commencement Celebration＞ (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
In recent shonen manga, what sets "Demon Slayer" apart is the exceptionally large number of training scenes.
In general, it has become a common belief that training arcs without battles, where characters practice day and night, are not popular among readers.
In the same Jump manga "ONE PIECE", there was a 2-year training period when the Straw Hat crew was separated, but it can be inferred that they only depicted a small part of it and bravely skipped the rest.
Well, one of the charms of One Piece is the eccentricity of the various lands it travels through, and "staying in the same place to train" may not always be the best match for that.
Well, it can be said that the protagonist of "Demon Slayer", Tanjiro's training, began when he prostrated himself before Tomioka Giyuu who saved his life, and begged for his sister Nezuko's life, who tried to take his own life, only to be told by Giyuu, "Do not let others hold the power of life and death over you!"
English: The weak have no rights or options, they can only be completely overpowered by the strong through force...
While saying that, the introduction of Sakonji Urokodaki, who trains the aspiring members of the Demon Slayer Corps, showed the kindness of Giyu (although he is not good at communicating without explaining his intentions).
The first contact between Tanjiro and Rengoku was when Rengoku asked, "What would you do if your sister ate a person?", and Tanjiro hesitated to answer, resulting in Rengoku saying "You're too slow to decide" and giving him a slap.
It's an seemingly unreasonable exchange that is talked about among fans.
However, walking around with my sister who has become a demon, carries the possibility that there may come a moment when I have to make such a decision.
It can be said that the initiation into training begins with one's mindset.
However, Rengoku brings the complete amateur Tanjiro, who hasn't trained yet, to Mt. Sagiri and tells him to descend to the foot of the mountain before dawn.
In the mountains, the air is thin and there are pitfalls, stone-throwing machines, and traps everywhere, making it seem like I might die before I even start training.
Even so, with their inherent keen sense of smell, they manage to detect the faint scent of traps set by humans and barely avoid them, which can be considered as a form of "protagonist's prerogative."
Even so, the essence of Demon Slayer lies in Tanjiro saying, "But that doesn't mean I can suddenly avoid all of it and my physical abilities won't skyrocket all of a sudden!"
Ordinary people don't suddenly become strong without any basis, and awakening just means being able to use the "power and skills that have been polished up to that point" at their full potential.
For those who have made efforts, there is a "fair exchange of effort" that rewards them according to what they have done and gives nothing to those who have not exerted effort. This is a humanistic ode that is different from a demon with unfounded supernatural powers and is a consistent and hard-to-change rule in this work.
Is this old?
English: Still not in bed, but sleeping by laying a mat directly on the floor, using a futon mattress and a comforter.
English: Because my house is not an apartment.
I'm doing that too.
If you want to make better use of the space in your room, it is better to sleep on a futon rather than a bed.
I think there are many people like that too.
Is it greedy?
Working as a part-timer and wanting to work full-time by juggling multiple jobs at other stores, is that greedy?
No, I don't particularly think so.
In that case, I don't think it would fall under the category of "greedy" as I understand it.
I think that trying to somehow obtain more profit than the labor involved with minimal effort is considered "greedy."

South Korean Samsung Electronics establishes a new "DX Division" integrating home appliances and mobile devices, "Emphasizing user experience" (WoW! Korea) - Yahoo! News
English: Following the integration of Samsung Electronics' CE and IM divisions into a single set division, the company announced on the 12th that it has decided on the name DX (Device eXperience) and will reflect this in the organizational restructuring at the end of the year.
Through various services ranging from mobile to household appliances, the intention is to enhance the user experience (Experience).
Samsung Electronics revealed that their newly launched DX division, which integrates the CE and IM departments, consists of business units such as VD (Visual Display), home appliances, medical devices, MX (Mobile eXperience), and networks.
A Samsung Electronics representative explained, "The name change this time reflects the medium-to-long term business structure, future-oriented nature, and strengthening of global leadership."
Additionally, they emphasized the intention to enable consumers to easily enjoy optimized experiences through services and solutions that reflect customer needs, not only for products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication equipment.
With the launch of the integrated leadership system, we also reflected the strategy of creating synergies across the entire company beyond organizational boundaries, and building a foundation for differentiated products and services in the name.
Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy through the "Multi Device Experience (MDE) Council" to enable users to freely use content and services through the interconnection of devices such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

I think it should be that way.
What concerns me is
Did you refer to other documentaries?
Are you looking from an ant's perspective?
English: Is that so?
English: If we translate "armoured heads" as "disc-shaped heads," I think the part about "it's a giant beast wearing a helmet on an ant's scale" will be lost...
Aichi 24 Vehicle Collision: Trailer Driver Has No Existing Illness, Possibly Due to Carelessness (TV Asahi (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
In a car accident involving 24 vehicles in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, it was found that the trailer driver who was arrested and sent to the prosecutor's office had no chronic illness, and it is believed that the accident was caused by some kind of negligence.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles, including trucks and passenger cars, collided on National Route 41 in Komaki City, resulting in 12 people sustaining minor injuries.
English: The police arrested and sent Katsuya Nomura (54), the suspect who was driving a trailer, on the morning of the 12th, on suspicion of causing a rear-end collision and injuring a 71-year-old man in the initial accident.
English: Nomura suspect's trailer continued to move without applying the brakes even after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that the Nomura suspect temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, it was found that Nomura suspect has no pre-existing medical conditions, and some kind of carelessness is believed to be the cause.
The police are conducting house searches of relevant parties and thoroughly investigating the situation at the time.

Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comics Volume 4 Edition] (Weekly Pre NEWS) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which began in the 3rd volume, concludes in this 4th volume!
English: In contrast to the previous volume, which covered everything from the opening to the semifinals at once, this volume is packed with new tricks due to its focus on just one battle!
● "Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Reviewer: Oginuma X ★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ● The superhuman wrestling begins even before the match starts!
In a nutshell, this 4-volume series is a book that carefully and thoroughly depicts the final battle between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but what we should first emphasize is that it does not solely focus on the matches inside the ring.
Starting from the signing ceremony, there are various scenes such as mutual restraint battles and special training that are quite different from before, and it doesn't easily lead to a match, but it's never boring.
The growing tension in the story as the battle of the century is about to begin is directly linked to the increasing excitement of the readers, making this period feel like a truly well-calculated production that never ceases to amaze.
And before the important finals, there's another crucial match you can't miss: the 3rd place playoff between Terryman and Ramenman.
Not only is the battle card extravagant, but what I love is the scene before the match where Ramenman points to Kinnikuman's poster backstage and says, "From now on, it's my turn to aim for the top!"
English: Attempt to hit with a chop.
However, Terryman, who happened to pass by, stopped the hand blade and prevented it. They stared at each other in silence, and the scene ended just like that, with them going their separate ways.
What's amazing about this is that both of them have already been defeated, and they no longer have a chance to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
English: But there is such a struggle going on around that Kinnikuman.
When shown something like this, I can't help but let my thoughts wander to our distant future accomplishments!
This is a scene that makes me realize, even now as a manga artist, what it means for a character to stand out!
The battle between the two of them doesn't last very long, but the memorable scene is Ramenman's tearful plea after the match.
To Kinnikuman, "Please don't rely solely on your divine luck! ! "
English: That is the line/phrase.
This is, in a way, a grand meta-commentary on the work itself. Up until now, I think readers have had a feeling that Kinnikuman, in the end, won't lose because he's the protagonist, and he's somewhat been winning in ways other than his actual strength.
However, by having Ramenman make this statement, Teacher Yudetamago preemptively drove a nail in, declaring that this method can no longer be used.
With this single phrase, the reader wonders, "Wait, could it be that KinnikuMan is going to defeat Robin with his real ability?"
How do I do it?
In English: Moreover, such an unpredictable development will surely stimulate your imagination, and from another writer's perspective, this line is like a self-imposed constraint on the creator Yudetamago-sensei as he creates the work.
English: This is like something amazing was done.
I definitely think that it is one of the major points in this volume.

English: Winter Illumination Weekend Held at Takahama Aoba Mountain (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Aobayama Herbal Village in Takahama Town, Nakayama, the first-ever winter illumination has begun, and the park is wrapped in a gentle light.
(December 12th) The winter illumination, which started on November 26th, features 50,000 LED bulbs scattered along the walking paths and lawns, including a 20-meter-tall camphor tree.
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture said, "I came to Fukui after a long time and was surprised to find such a place here."
She was talking about how incredibly beautiful it was and how it made her feel at ease.
The illumination event, which was planned for the first time to provide relaxation while avoiding crowds, is lit up from 5:00 pm to 8:30 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25th.
On the last day, the 25th, a Christmas event is scheduled, including a pot dish with buttons and a movie screening.

Online distribution, promoting agricultural and livestock products - Okitama Agricultural Promotion Association, live broadcast from Yonezawa | Yamagata Shimbun
The Oitama Agricultural Promotion Council, which is composed of municipalities and JA (Japan Agricultural Cooperatives) in the Oitama region, launched a PR campaign for agricultural and livestock products on November 11th, utilizing "live commerce," where products are sold while streaming videos on the internet.
The Tokyo Minato Ward organized its first "National Collaboration MINATO (port) Market TV," where Yamagata's beloved Samurai Team made a remote appearance, delivering the charm of the region along with its specialty products.
The collaboration effort between the Okitama region and Minato Ward, known as the "Okitama x Minato Port Opening Project," led to the decision to open a store, which was broadcast live from the Satoyama Vision House in Minamihara Shinmachi, Yonezawa City.
Ms. Mikasa Kuroda, who is active as a "Satoyama Sommelier," wears a Yonezawa weaving brand "nitorito" stole and introduces the charm of the region surrounded by nature.
English: Delivered the situation of the potato stew party together with the Love Samurai Squad.
In a Tokyo studio, comedian duo "TANPOPO" Emiko Kawamura and other YouTubers with over 300,000 subscribers tasted local sake, wine, Yonezawa beef, and Tuyahime rice from the Oitama region.
When the deliciousness was conveyed to the viewers, comments such as "I can smell it through the stream" and "Lots of delicious food and drinks, it's the best" were exchanged in high praise.
Is there a way to POST what was obtained from a form on the same PHP page?
If there are values in the <input> elements within the form, it will be submitted via POST.
Is that not the case?
I am thinking of planting balloon flowers in the garden.
Is the balloon flower resistant to the summer heat?
In that case, when the flowers finish blooming in spring, let's cut the stems leaving 10-15cm remaining.
From the base of the leaves, branches will grow, so please look forward to it.
Happy New Year!
English: I just returned from our first shrine visit with her.
Her smile is still wonderful in the new year, isn't it?

Please tell me
Happy New Year!
It's nice to be in love, isn't it? ＼(^o^)／
English: Unfortunately, this morning...
The power for the NAS PC is not turning on anymore🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
English: ~Things that occurred~
1.) In the morning, I open the window for ventilation.
English: At this time, the PC is powered on.
English: 2.) After a while, when I returned to my room, I noticed that there was a sound like a pink rotor coming from the PC, so for the time being, I shut it down.
At this point, I thought that the decrease in room temperature (6°C) was just causing the fan to function poorly.
So, I decided to try again after warming the room.
English: 3.) Not starting up.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp turns on and the fan starts to spin for just a moment, but then it stops immediately.
After that, they didn't say a word.
Unplug the power cord and try again, but it still only turns on for a moment.
4.) Try removing all other parts and only connect the motherboard with the ATX 20-pin and 4-pin, but still does not boot up.
English: 5.) I have been suspicious that the PSU might be the cause, as there has been a noise like "bubububububu" when the PSU fan seems to be hitting something since before.
English: I will find a spare ATX power supply later and try it out.
English: Maybe.
If it doesn't work out... I wonder what I should do.
Should I change the case and motherboard together...
Have you seen any wild rabbits recently (within the past 4-5 years)?
Where did you see it?
Is it a place surrounded by nature?
I live in Northeast.
In English: They are everywhere near my house.
There are also in places like gardens and company parking lots.
2021 Most Frequently Used Emoji Ranking (Gizmodo Japan) - Yahoo! News
My most frequently used emoji is the crying loudly one.
I think emojis are essential communication tools for modern people.
Recently, there are many messaging apps and chat tools that allow you to use emoji reactions instead of stamps.
Speedy, easy, no reply needed, and soothing elements.
In modern communication, emojis are essential for creating a soft atmosphere, which is highly valued!
So, I wonder what kind of emojis everyone is using.
[View All Images] 2021 Most Used Emoji Ranking: Top 10 most used emojis worldwide in 2021!
Overall, positive and bright emojis are ranking in.
According to the original source Unicode, 92% of the world's internet population uses emojis.
English: The 1st place occupies 5% of the total emoji usage rate!
The crying and laughing emojis in 1st, 3rd, and 5th place are very convenient to use, aren't they?
Interesting times, happy times, of course, I did it!
English: There might be quite a few people who use self-deprecating phrases even during times when nothing can be done or when they feel helpless.
On the contrary, people who have never used any of the top 10 emojis even once are extremely rare.
I hope you can maintain that style.

How do you dispose of computers and peripheral devices?
English: * Computer Farm
I brought it in only once, but even though it's in Misato city, Saitama prefecture, they don't collect it for free from Saitama prefecture.
(If relatively new, available for free)
English: Inverse net
I have never used it, but it seems that if it's Sagawa, cash on delivery shipping is completely free.
I'm thinking of trying it, so if anyone knows about it, I'd like to hear their opinion.
Bulky waste, etc. (paid), additional note: collection box by the local government (small household appliances, free of charge)
English: Sell it as second-hand.
Addition＞Mercari, Hard Off
I wonder if there are people who sell at flea markets or auctions? I've never sold a used PC before.
It might be a wise choice to sell it while it can make money.
English: * Addendum＞LINETT JAPAN Information provided by: /u/CheetahPresent8059
The broken printer that no one will take, and old UPS, etc. have become a nuisance.
It's not oversized garbage, so it probably won't cost any money, but it's somehow being postponed.
I collect coins as a hobby.
Please let me know if anyone can tell me the value of this coin.
Foreign coins in circulation have no value...
In Japan, paper bills are exchanged but coins are not.
If it's a commemorative gold coin, it has value because it contains gold.
Even though they didn't do anything wrong, there are times when you just dislike someone, right?
Yes, it's natural to have likes and dislikes because we are humans.
"(There's no particular reason, but) I just don't like it." That's how it is for people who dislike something.

Men's Volleyball: First finals tournament appearance in 29 years! / Men's Fencing: Fencer finishes in 4th place without winning a medal.
Ryujin Nippon, first quarterfinals in 29 years! Japan men's volleyball team advances to the final tournament; Coach Nakagauchi says "It was a big goal."

Men's Fencing Foil Team: Japan misses out on a medal, defeated by the United States
I feel that the opponent in the semifinals was in a different class compared to the previous ones, but why is such an opponent in the third-place playoff?
I would like to plant trees in my garden that can serve as a visual barrier. If you have any recommendations, please let me know.
As for the preference, it would be nice to have an evergreen tree that is easy to maintain and, if possible, bears fruit.
Nice to meet you. / Please treat me well.
To bear fruit on a feijoa tree, it is better to plant other fruit-bearing trees such as olive, blueberry, and plum nearby.
How much savings do we each need to have in order to live together comfortably?
English: It varies from person to person.
It depends on where you live and what kind of relationship you have.
It is better to stop living together.
There is a high possibility of breaking up.
It is better to properly arrange a matchmaker, hold a betrothal ceremony, attend various bridal events, and have a wedding and reception.
There are no benefits to living together.
I think it's better to quit, but...
Today, I went to the game center and played an arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle: Ganbarizing.
Oh! I thought it was a Legendary Rare, but it turned out to be a re-recorded Legendary Rare (^_^;)
Is it okay to play card games like Ganbarizing as a hobby?
I think it's an ant.
