English: The reason why I left PDP.
Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has revealed some reasons why he left PDP and returned to APC.
English: If not forgotten, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, had defected from the PDP party and joined APC in this month.
Dogara said that he stood by Governor Bala of PDP in Bauchi state and helped the party to win the 2019 election, before he left the party and joined APC.
The main reason for my departure is how PDP is governing in Bauchi state.
English: Everyone knows the kind of role I played in the governorship election where the former Minister of Abuja, Bala Mohammed defeated the incumbent governor, Mohammed Abubakar.
But now, I am the one causing confusion and chaos in Bala's government.
English: Instead of continuing to stay in PDP, they have given me what I deserve, it's better for me to leave them and return to where I came from.
English: Dogara has written a resignation letter from PDP which he sent to the chairman of his constituency, Bogoro C, in Bauchi state.
In the end, he said it was like how he used to show other governors where they failed and where they would improve, but Bala was neither transparent nor fair.
English: Let me go on a trip to meet them.
A fire broke out in a house in Kano.
The fire outbreak occurred around 10 pm in the evening, which lasted for about two hours before it was extinguished, despite the efforts of the Kano State Fire Service, security personnel, and local residents who went to the scene.
English: At the time Freedom Radio visited the place, it found a mix of people and different security personnel at the location from everywhere, as the place is connected to a major motor park known as Kuka Park, where vehicles are being transported from Kano to other states and even countries that share a border with this country.
Behind the Kofar Ruwa market, which has expanded in Northern Nigeria.
English: Freedom Radio had a discussion with some eyewitnesses, who said the explosion caused great panic and fear among the people.
A car dealership in Kofar Ruwa said they have collaborated with security personnel to trace and arrest the thieves who broke in and stole vehicles due to the high rate of theft.
The Kano State Anti-Pollution Agency has confirmed the occurrence of the incident, saying that at the time of compiling this report, it is still gathering information to determine the causes and effects of the pollution, as explained by the agency's spokesperson, Sa'idu Muhammad Ibrahim.
English: In another development, reports say that some thieves attempted to break into the Kofar Ruwa market to steal, but the police and security officers made efforts to chase them away while protecting the properties of the public.
English: It was on this basis that we contacted the Kano State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, who confirmed the incident.
CORONA TREATMENT: Up till now, we have not completed the efficacy test of the treatment developed in Nigeria.
English: As European countries continue to make progress in developing more effective COVID-19 vaccines, Nigeria is not being left behind in the process of creating and testing its own medicines.
English: The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has announced that it is testing 40 traditional medicine coronavirus treatments that have been submitted to the agency by local herbal practitioners.
English: The head of the agency, Mojisola Adeyeye, announced this on Tuesday in the city of Abuja.
Mojisola said they are conducting quality tests on the drugs to avoid people seeking fake medicines in the quest for a cure.
Since the outbreak of the Corona virus, traditional medicine practitioners have intensified research to ensure they are not left behind in finding a cure for the disease.
Many of them have submitted their vaccines to the authorities for testing and verification of their effectiveness.
Similarly, NAFDAC has provided them with some guidelines and requirements that they must follow in producing the medicine.
There will be testing of the efficacy of drugs on animals in the first stage of the experiment.
English: Mojisola warned those using medicines not to make the mistake of trying any medication without the approval of the relevant authorities.
In the month of May, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) announced that it is only on social media and newspaper pages that stories of claims are being seen, stating that they have discovered a traditional medicine that will cure the Coronavirus.
English: Adeyeye explained that an individual appealed to the NAFDAC agency to investigate the potency of the medicine he claims to have produced traditionally, which he said could be effective in the treatment of Coronavirus.
English: As for that other person, it's not like he said he found a cure for the disease immediately.
English: It has been discovered that the symptoms of ill health being observed are symptoms of infection with the disease.
However, after that, some of those with the medicine continued to challenge the authority and their alliance.

To Lagos city, but it is not yet clear when or where these airplanes will come from.
English: According to the Minister of Aviation Hadi Sirika, the purpose of opening this (route) is to see how there are no problems since the resumption of domestic flights on the 8th of July.
Sirika further added that they will ensure all necessary measures are taken to achieve success in the return of the confiscated pigeons.

English: APC Accuses Niger Governor of Attempting to Bring Crisis to the Party - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
English: In a recent statement, the APC party announced that they have accused the Governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, of attempting to cause division within the party.
English: The statement, which was signed by the Chairman of the Engineering Society, Muhammad Jibrin Imam, and the Secretary of the Bar Association, Muhammed Liman, revealed that in the six years the society has been in control of the state, it received only 512 million Naira.
The statement went on to say that the meeting called by the governor with stakeholders, which he presided over on Saturday night at the end of last month, would help in the ongoing efforts to bring development to the state, where they said they have written to the national party secretary about the ongoing events in the state.
According to Engineer Imam, "we understand that the Governor of Niger State is trying to divide the youth members of the party by organizing a watery and weak gathering, which is not based on any principle, because any decision being made on the party leaders should be written to the party secretary to investigate it".
English: He continued, saying that up until now in the six years since establishing the party, there are 512 million naira in the party's account.
He said, what he understood as the Governor's position is being a member of the national reconciliation committee that was established on July 25, 2020, which the President leads in order to coordinate efforts to resolve the issues between the party's youth and resolve disputes that are in court between the party's youth.
He said the funds we received were used to pay for the party secretary's staff and their activities, some of which involve social activities, organizing competitions, solving some youth social problems such as lack of healthcare due to lack of government funding, and not spending any of the party's funds illegally or without following the rules. We are always transparent, and everyone can see how we manage and disburse the party's funds.
As I mentioned earlier, the grassroots elections in the 25 local government areas of the state and beyond are the most important elections we have had in this country, which we conducted together with top-ranking commissioners and those responsible for massive support in all the 25 local government areas of the state, where the funds spent on the elections were given to the commissioners to bring about great results.
English: Therefore, it is a mistake for anyone to say that society's funds are being wasted without following the rules, this is almost unfair and an attempt to deliberately tarnish the reputation, he said there is no committee set up to investigate how the society's funds were spent and who established it.
English: From the evidence that the auditor provided, he said that the misappropriated funds are those that the country's secretary had given out, not some other funds like this. Therefore, I am investigating everyone involved in this matter and he provided evidence to confirm this allegation against her in every way.
Imam said we have taken a strong stand to protect the APC party from any individual or group trying to destabilize the party. He added that any accusation against the party or any party leader from the state level will be put in writing to the committee in charge of disciplinary measures, as stated in section 21 (B) (b), (d) on page 82 of the party's constitution.
Therefore, the party members who are involved in water and noise issues have no significant impact when they attempt to overthrow the committee's power, and thus their judgment has no effect.
English: Due to this reason, they are the approved leaders of the party which they agreed to in the state, specifically at point 21 and paragraph 6 on page 87 of the party's constitution, and anything contrary to this will not be beneficial.
English: Because of the judgement made, the love and trust in the leaders had led them to make a mistake.
English: He said, those who presented themselves for approval in yesterday's Monday meeting in which he did not participate, which included Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, as well as Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all the commissioners, were not members of the party's revenue committee in the state.
The water and sanitation committee of the association is led by the association's president, Engineer Mohammed Imam, who will be in charge of it alone, not the governor, who will be in charge of the association's leaders at the state level.
The statement further stated that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello recalled the issue of fulfilling the promises made to the people of the state during the election, as well as the journey and involvement of the party's stakeholders in the government so that everyone would benefit in the state and all activities through the provision of political positions, which is the challenge of the governor and the party.
The resolution commended the national assembly members who participated in the conference and drew attention to the need for peace and resolution of all the issues between the various political parties. This is not surprising for the members of the assembly who are aware of their responsibilities and have agreed to uphold integrity as the policy of the party.
English: Therefore, there is a need for the head of the state's investigative committee to draw the attention of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello to the appropriate position so that he does not attempt to interfere in the politics of the state.

How the deteriorating food situation affects people's health in Nigeria.
Some chemistry experts have advised people to avoid eating food prepared with preservatives, stating that consuming such food can cause damage to one's health.
The experts gave this warning after conducting a study on the quality of food being consumed in this country.
The research result shows that there are some foods that are mixed with preservatives to prevent them from spoiling.
The research also shows that this method is most commonly used in fishing, particularly in cities and villages where fish are sold to the public.
English: The medicine is being used so that when a person sees it and feels like buying it, they can use it.
Then eating food that contains this preservative can cause forest disease, stomach pain, heart palpitations and others.
People in this country have been urged to be mindful of consuming these types of food to maintain their health.
English: If not forgotten, a renowned food technologist, Grace Olasumbo, called on Nigerians to stop consuming fruits ripened with Calcium Carbide.
English: Olasumbo explained that Sindarin Calcium Carbide is the most commonly used by traders for the purpose of ripening fruits, specifically bananas.
Research shows that patience and cooperation are among the factors that make market participants benefit from this strategy, as within a day it demonstrates the effectiveness of the methodology.
English: Olasumbo explained that one of the things the market people failed to see is the use of this strategy to indicate the quality control of the materials for the health of individuals except for the price.
English: Due to this, people will become infected with diseases such as conjunctivitis, asthma, abdominal pain, typhoid fever, oral infections, skin diseases, and others.
The President of the African Development Bank has been cleared of allegations - Freedom Radio Nigeria
The integrity committee led by former Irish President Mary Robinson has cleared African Development Bank (AfDB) president Akinwumi Adesina of any wrongdoing.
According to Mr. Akinwumi Adesina's committee, he is not guilty of the corruption allegations against him.

English: Only the committee of experts led by Robinson, along with Gambia's chief justice Hassan Jallow and the World Bank's deputy governor in charge of corruption prevention Leonard McCarthy, have cleared the former agriculture minister of Nigeria from all allegations against him.
In the past, it was the United States that insisted on investigating Mr. Adesina on allegations, following a complaint and a probe by the African Development Bank (AfDB) management, an issue that led to the formation of an expert committee to conduct the investigation on the matter.

English: Nevertheless, the major events will be held in North Carolina.
Trump said in Jacksonville that holding a major rally is not appropriate at this time.

English: Some representatives of the Republican party will gather in Charlotte city, North Carolina, where they will nominate Trump for presidency on the 24th of August.

English: The Feast Achieved Success in Gathering People and Food - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
English: Food is the essence of life for all living things, one cannot survive properly without food.
English: This is the reason why the Chinese government is making more efforts to ensure the country's population is well fed.
In the past 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has achieved remarkable successes in the field of food security, which has amazed the world considering the large population of the country, with an estimated number of Chinese people exceeding 1.4 billion.
This effort greatly helps to address the issue that has led China to provide significant assistance in eradicating hunger worldwide, as the head of the Chinese Department of Grain and Material Reserves, Zhang Wufeng, has repeatedly stated that, since 1949 up to now, at all times, China has prioritized addressing hunger ahead of all other national development and affairs.
English: But in recent days, some people and some news platforms in the western countries have once again "expressed concerns" over whether China would be able to successfully vaccinate its population against the COVID-19 outbreak around the globe?
We are very grateful to them because they always take care of Sinawa's existence in this world.
Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the country has achieved success in providing self-sufficient food through its relentless efforts.
English: The issue of providing food to Sinawa residents is among the major projects of the ruling JKS party every day.
At the end of last month, the Secretary-General of the JKS committee and the President of China, Xi Jinping, issued an important directive to stop wasting food, indicating that everyone should know that every grain of food and hard work is being consumed.
English: Although this year the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the world and also caused damage to China's economy, China is still able to provide sufficient food for its people.
The report released by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics regarding the country's grain output, especially rice production in 2020, shows that the total rice output in the first half of 2020 reached 27.29 million tons, an increase of 1.08 million tons, or 3.9% when compared with the same period of 2019.
English: Shi Ma Ke Bingsheng, the former head of the university's agricultural department in China, said that China has achieved significant success in terms of food security when compared to the early days of implementing household responsibility system and opening doors to private markets.
Huang Jikun, director of the agricultural policy research center in China at Peking University, revealed in an interview with "The China Science Daily" that the current crisis China is facing may last for two or three years, and China may reduce the consumption of corn and rice that it stores in storage silos.
English: Now the average person has access to 474 kilograms instead of the 400 kilograms that every person in the world should have access to every year.
And now, China has introduced some agricultural machinery worth millions of tons for domestic animal husbandry purposes only.
English: Therefore, those who are worried about the issue should calm down, take a bath and go to sleep, or direct their concerns towards activities within their country.
The Sinawa people are capable of providing themselves with the food they produce.
The reason why I sued Ganduje in court - Abba K. Yusuf - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
English: Abba Kabir Yusuf, the Kano governorship candidate of the PDP, has explained his reasons for confronting Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and some traders in front of the state's high court.

English: Behind the Kano state government and the market traders, Abba Kabir Yusuf has also made a promise to the state's ministry of works and infrastructure, the attorney general, the Kano Sharia commissioner and the state's environmental protection agency.
English: Abba Kabir Yusuf has accused the Kano State Government of neglecting some displaced people from the old State Lodge, which is now under the supervision of the Chemical and Natural Science University in Wudil and Shahuci Park, saying that this has violated the laws of the country.
I only like spinach, in a variety of dishes with different styles in 2023.
English: Elder brother and close confidant of Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari, Mamman Daura, has stated that the prevailing rotational system of governance in Nigeria has become outdated.
English: Mamman Daura said Nigeria has already made progress and is now focused on implementing a well-structured plan, paying attention to the 2023 election, which is of utmost importance.
English: BBC Hausa published an interview with Mamman Daura in which he explained this.
This alternating system for electing a president in Nigeria has not brought about the desired change since its inception in 1999.
Instead of that, Daura said attention should be focused on finding who is responsible, not just following this pattern of fruitless searches.
But also, the Igbo people, that is, the Inyamirai, have responded to Daura with their own words regarding this issue.
English: They said it was only after him and his son that President Buhari would succeed in ruling the country through gradual takeover, and now he is expected to come out and advise not to do this in 2023.
English: Buhari himself is not better than all Nigerians, but he was voted for.
Thus, many security guards of this country who have been living in their quarters for many years have not been evicted, and they are not more competent than others in work.
Mantis Insect.
English: A recent political crisis in Nigeria was averted on Wednesday, as the Igbo National Stakeholders Assembly, Ndigbo, retracted its criticism of Mamman Daura for his controversial statement on Nigeria's leadership rotation which affected the Igbo tribe.
In a recent conversation in Daura, which is the hometown of President Muhammadu Buhari, it was said that there will be a rotational system for the presidential election to take place in 2023.
English: In this manner, since his words have not completely disappeared from social media, Ndigbo quickly released a statement concerning Mamman Daura's dismissal, accompanied by a call for an end to the discrimination.
In a statement released on Wednesday, Ndigbo, a group of the Igbo tribe in the southern region, announced that they will support the eastern Shiyyar Kudu in the 2023 presidential election, meaning the Igbo tribe is involved.
English: The spokesperson for the President of the Igbo Zalla Clan Association, Emeka Attamah, said that Mamman Daura's statement on zoning the presidency of Nigeria in 2023 is offensive to the Igbo ethnic group.
English: Apart from contributing, what prevented Mamman Daura from talking about lobbying since 2019?
They have defeated and removed Jonathan, now Daura is strategizing for the southern region, which will lead Nigeria in the 2023 elections.
English: After he has completed transferring the item from the hand of his subordinate, who is currently the leader of this country, he will then present us with an unexpected event that we did not know about in 2023.
English: It is important for him to maintain his position as a responsible individual by upholding the truth and handling it properly.
It is not about bringing out the competition of leadership in this country in 2023, but the competition is about showing love and respect for life.
The VOA Discussion Forum on Fraud.
The issue of child abuse and the molestation of young girls has become a burning issue in northern Nigeria, where reports have been obtained showing how children's rights are being violated.
English: People from various areas gathered at the venue on the 23rd of July to discuss the increasing issues in the country and how best to tackle them.
The challenges in the neighborhood are connected to issues like child trafficking and the kidnapping of some parents.
English: One of the mothers who attended the gathering, Hajiya Fathi'a Sha'ibu, the wife of the former governor of Filato and Neja states during the reign of the late Sani Abacha, described poverty as one of the factors that make parents expose their children to begging.
English: Hajiya Maryam Mamman Nasir, leader of a group advocating for the fight against this menace, said, "First of all, we should create awareness and educate mothers about the dangers of letting their children roam the streets, because it's only when the child goes out that one will see him and abuse him."
We will also call on the scholars to start preaching with a strong voice to parents and relatives who are molesting their daughters and young ones.
English: Indeed, the member of the House of Representatives representing Maiyama, Koko, and Besse constituency in Kebbi State, Honorable Shehu Mohammad, highlighted the seriousness of the issue and expressed support for ensuring the implementation of a strict law that would punish anyone caught committing rape in the country.
English: From the end of Hajiya Madina Dauda and Nasiru El-hikaya, who led the event, they expressed their gratitude to those who received the invitation to the event with the help of VOA administration, and they celebrated their inauguration.
The Efforts of 'Arewa Media Writers' in Supporting the Northern Region.
English: Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bakandamiya, and others have long been actively involved in providing communication channels, fostering connections and cohesion among people from different parts of the world, as well as disseminating messages, news, and diverse political, educational, and business information.
English: The youth in Nigeria have embraced this new space by utilizing social media platforms, for travel and modernization, and providing their support or giving their voices to causes that affect their lives.
We can say that these initiatives have brought significant progress that benefits many Northern youths in the areas of commerce, economy, education, and regional politics.
Many people obtain food through writing and sending messages on the internet; they carry out tasks or even expand the tasks they are performing.
The only sad thing is seeing some young people, instead of making use of this opportunity to contribute to the progress that has been made, follow those who take advantage of vulnerable children in the southern part of the country, who run into the world to cause public outrage, both in and outside the country, or to engage in writing malicious and slanderous falsehoods and criticisms against authorities and elders.
The lack of progress, particularly in the lives of the youth in this country, is evident.
English: The arrival of the Arewa Media Writers group in this country is a great blessing, as it aims to provide Northern youth with proper guidance and pure content on social media, so that they become meaningful and knowledgeable writers that contribute to the development of the Arewa community.
English: It is our responsibility to support this group's collaboration and provide what it needs to achieve its positive objectives, which will bring benefits not only to our Northern region but also to the entire Nigeria.
I am advising our youths, especially those who use social media platforms to come together to protect the dignity of the North and its unity, and also to create a system that will bring improvement to everyone.
English: Just like our northern leaders who have emulated the likes of the Premier of the Northern Region, Sir Ahmadu Bello, the first Sardauna of Sokoto, and others who have had the ambition to serve the people of the North.
It is reported that the late great warrior and antagonist of injustice and poverty, Malam Aminu Kano, once said, "Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows their own house!"
Therefore, we say, it is undeniable that during our call for national development and improving the transport and governance sectors, in every aspect, we continue to appeal for the cooperation of the people of the North, without showing any religious or tribal bias, in order to bring progress to our region.
English: If we consider how the North was, it is not like that anymore.
Therefore, we should make use of the wisdom and guidance that Allah has given us, in order to provide the North with a sustainable path for progress and economic growth.
It is necessary for the North to create ways to generate income in order to sustain its economy without relying on the federal government to provide funds.
Progressively, if indeed we desire the development of the North, we must give importance to education, agriculture, and the opening of opportunities, as well as health and chemistry and physics.
English: No matter how little, we will contribute, there are different ways to do so.
We see it that way, the North will overcome our challenges and achieve their goals!
The North is our pride.
The government has allocated 126 billion naira for the renovation of hospitals in this country.
The federal government has allocated 126 billion naira from the economic stabilization fund to improve hospitals in the country.
English: The hospitals to be renovated include the FMC hospital, places for performing surgeries, the emergency care department, the section for treating patients with contagious diseases that should not spread to others, and educational hospitals located in the 36 states of the country.
In the past years, some experts in the health sector have called on the government to join hands in allocating more funds to improve the health sector of this country.
The authorities made this call at a conference to provide an affordable health care system to people with ease, which was held in Abuja.
In his response, the senator representing Kwara North under the platform of the APC party, Sadiq Umar, said it is necessary for the Nigerian government to prioritize improving the health sector of the country due to its importance.
He said the lack of doing so is what causes the area to face financial problems, which in turn leads to increased dependence on aid from foreign countries.
Umar said that despite these reliefs being received, there is no significant improvement seen in the government's role in the health sector, which has led them to start reducing the assistance they are providing.

In Longyuan village of Hongsipu district in Wuzhong city, located in the northern-central region of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, which is in the northern part of China.
There is an exceptional woman named Li Yaomei, also known as Sadiya (which is her Muslim name), who is famous for her incredible resilience in life and her success in escaping the grip of poverty.
English: His story tells us that effort, determination, and seeking success are things that lie within the heart.
English: Firstly, Li Yaomei or Sadiya, she never stayed in a place with the intention of getting an education, a situation which made her unable to read or write.
Only God can give her the gift of great insight and wisdom in abundance, making her an example in the field of striving and patience.
About 20 years ago, Madam Li Yaomei suffered from severe abdominal pain, which led to her undergoing surgery for it three times.
After developing her wings, she encountered a dangerous threat, and now she's traveling with the added strength put into her wings.
These challenges and their effects have plunged her into a precarious situation, affecting her health and even the issue of medication, which is why she has incurred a debt of about 3 million Yuan, equivalent to 16 million Naira.
English: It's surprising, this challenge that Malama Sadiya faced has become a way for her to escape and fight for the improvement of her life.
Furthermore, the support that the Chinese government has given, has greatly strengthened her.

English: Seeing the challenges Malama Sadiya has faced, and her continued efforts to improve her life and her family's, it can be understood that she is indeed determined to succeed and find a way.
The struggle against poverty and improving life is not a responsibility solely resting on the government.
English: If the government continues to provide assistance, but people lack the resources or desire to improve their lives by seeking opportunities based on their current situation, then progress will only be made step by step without achieving any significant success.
English: The report indicates that carrying out a trade or work to earn entry fees does not require any special permissions or traveling to other cities or foreign countries.
In order to adapt to her situation, she made use of the resources available in her environment to improve her life.
Against all odds, malama Sadiya carried out these tasks independently and skillfully without relying on her husband, who had fled and left her.
English: That is, determination and perseverance in seeking success, is something that lies within the heart.
Then, it showed the kind of strength that women possess in changing their lives and standing on their own without seeking help from anyone.
This is a lesson that shows that whatever a person does, he should be mindful of his actions, because dealing with someone else is never certain.
Indeed, Malama Sadiya is an intelligent person, endowed with wisdom and foresight, who has become an exemplar and a source of knowledge for others.
Up until today, until the month of March ends, Malama Sadiya has completed paying all the debts she owes, and also stopped receiving any assistance from the government based on her own decision.

English: There are Concerns that American Politicians Will Hinder Efforts to Combat COVID-19 - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In recent days, the World Health Organization's (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has expressed concern about the measures some countries are taking to hoard COVID-19 vaccines, which are hoped to be produced soon. He emphasized the importance of transparency and solidarity among different countries when distributing the coronavirus vaccine.
And it is necessary to distribute the vaccine through appropriate means around the world, because doing so will align with the great responsibility of different countries.
English: Indeed, some American politicians are carrying out efforts to show their patriotism, regarding the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and they are also intensifying cooperation between countries in the fight against the pandemic.
As of now, the total number of people confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 worldwide has exceeded 23 million.
English: Among the number, there are people who lost their lives due to the disease, which has claimed more than 800 lives.
English: Under this kind of challenging circumstance, more attention is being given to the impact of the vaccine, and the good news is that in recent days, significant progress has been made in studying the vaccine in some countries, an achievement that has brought hope and confidence to nearly half of the world's population.
English: However, the real issue is that some American politicians have shown their desire to seize the opportunity.
Even the journal "Science" has revealed that the US government has already pre-ordered COVID-19 vaccine doses worth over $6 billion, from various pharmaceutical companies.
English: Despite understanding the intentions of the American government, being at the forefront of vaccine distribution, other countries still need support in obtaining vaccines, considering that they are more affected by the lack of adequate health care resources.
English: The magazine "The Ecologist" also indicated that if America achieves its goal of reducing emissions, the number of emissions produced by developing countries will decrease.
Chicken seller, the director of the Africa CDC, Mr. John Nkengasong, also expressed concern about this issue.
English: As some commentators have pointed out on daily issues, even with the successful production of the vaccine, it will not be possible to achieve the goal of eradicating the disease unless the distribution of the vaccine is well planned, which is of paramount importance for country to country.
And it is appropriate for countries of the world to strengthen the cooperation among them.
English: The WHO's Director-General Tedros emphasized that if they want to successfully combat the pandemic, it is necessary to stop transmission in all sectors worldwide; otherwise, it may not be possible for some parts of the world or specific countries to achieve their desired immunity from the virus alone.

In an appeal to Tope Akinyade, he informed the High Court in Kado, Abuja, where he requested that they be prosecuted, because they had violated the federal government's directive on curfews and lockdown at the time.
He said there is a serious injustice to the Nigerian youth who were indiscriminately arrested and prosecuted during the lockdown, but also some influential people have violated the law, and none of them have been prosecuted.
He said if Buhari's government is indeed ensuring justice, then there is no reason for them to constantly arrest poor people if they violate the Corona law.
Also, some powerful people within the government have violated the policy, but they have been pardoned.
English: Among those Tope took to court, there are Secretary to the Federal Government, Boss Mustapha, Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, and Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management, Sadiya Umar.

English: But then, it was Tope who reminded the lawyer that he was the one who had brought the case to court without any interference from the police.
He said it is the judge's duty to send a notice to all those who are accused and would be asked to defend themselves.
For he has only done what the Nigerian law has given him the right to do in taking the matter to court.
The lawyer has postponed the hearing and the judgment, saying it will be moved to court on the 4th of August, in order to continue the hearing.

And we are also those terrorists, they are citizens of this country, it is said that there will be no peace with them.
