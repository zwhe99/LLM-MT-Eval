Shouted at the world
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have gotten off to a good start, and the shouts and calls out in nature are starting to pull in people from far and wide across the world.
"You own the riddle, I need Iceland," says a woman somewhere out in the great wide world in comments on an advertisement from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on the content platform YouTube.
English: Another spectator claims they will cherish Iceland in their heart for all eternity, and a young woman says she absolutely must get to Iceland as soon as possible, as her lover is living there.
To her great misfortune, she is however in the United States and therefore expects to have to wait for several more months.
Another spectator asks if the walking path to Iceland is passable, as there are no airplanes.
English: It is not mentioned in the story whether he comes from another time period.
English: Egill Þórðarson from the advertising agency Peel, which collaborated on the creation of the ad campaigns together with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says the reception has exceeded expectations.
English: "I have been a part of many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign is already breaking records."
In essence, this is about creating PR value, that is, getting foreign media to cover the campaign, and it has been incredibly successful.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received coverage in about seven hundred media outlets around the world, which together reach over two billion people.
The value of that coverage is estimated at 1.8 billion krona.
English: It is not strange.
The main market is usually the United States, and the campaign has been very successful there, even though Americans are not on their way to the country anytime soon.
According to Egill, well-known market areas such as Denmark, Britain, and Germany have also received them well, as has Russia, which comes as a pleasant surprise.
Then there were reactions from foreign regions, such as India, which were not specifically addressed.
English: "These advertisements have traveled farther than we expected," says Egill, but it should be mentioned that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
"We could not have wished for a better start."
The photos here at the opening were taken by Árni Sæberg, a photographer for Morgunblaðið, during the shooting of advertisements with the headline "Let It Out" in the middle of last month.
The shots were taken far and wide, such as on Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavik, in Reynisfjara, near Skógarfoss, on Sólheimajökull, and in a cave by Hjörleifshöfði.
Directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson from Skoti productions and cameraman Óttar Guðnason.
In the roles in the filmed scenes were the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary.
English: Ten Icelanders were involved in creating the advertisements, but at the same time as the recordings took place in the South, another group was in the West and the Westfjords.
According to Egill, "Let It Out" is just the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but the plan is for a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
"This is just the first phase in this work for Íslandsstofa," says Egill, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has been going extremely well.
English: "It is wonderful to work with them."
In such projects, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to."
Sprengisandur: Discuss the situation in the labor market, pension funds, and much more
English: Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children, will attend Sprengisand, which starts at ten o'clock on Bylgja today.
He is also the Minister of Labor and oversees the situation in the labor market as such, the Icelandair case, and several other matters.
He also deals with rural issues and the relocation of jobs to the countryside, which has gone poorly and been controversial in recent years and decades.
English: Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of VR, also appears in the program, where he will discuss his criticism regarding pension funds' investments and put forward ideas for the labor movement and employers to withdraw from the funds' boards in order to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Then there will be a discussion with Ívar Ingimarsson, a travel service manager in East Iceland, and Árnheiður Jóhannsdóttir, the executive director of the North Iceland Marketing Office, about the situation of tourism in rural areas.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder whether the success of the summer is a misleading omen of what is to come.
English: You can listen to the show below, which starts at ten o'clock.
English: This is what she looks like today, 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in various teenage shows.
Worldwide fame she gained though for her role as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
English: She also starred in the shows Sabrina: The Teenage Witch alongside Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and in Beverly Hills 90210.
English: Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Little has happened to her lately, but she managed to look back on her past and express herself about Clueless on Australian television the other day.
She speaks beautifully about Brittany Murphy, who passed away unexpectedly in 2009, and says she was a wonderful person.
English: "I have to admit that I mostly based the character on girls I met in school who were not nice to me."
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this character was," said Donovan about her role in Clueless.
Would not leave the police station after an overnight stay
English: About fifty cases were brought to the police in the capital region today, and the police diary states that the cases have been diverse.
English: The day at the police station on Hverfisgata began with the police having to deal with a man who had recently been released from a detention cell after having stayed there due to a drunk driving incident.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey the police's orders to go away.
The man earned himself an extended stay at the police station due to his behavior.
Then a man was arrested in the early morning, suspected of a break-in at a company in Kópavogur.
English: The police also had to intervene with two men in Breiðholt due to a report of physical assault.
Then it also happened that a woman who was eating at a shopping mall in Kópavogur could not pay for the bill after the meal and therefore the police was called.
English: It was also reported about a car theft in the downtown area this morning.
The driver of a white Renault delivery van looked away from her for a moment and then she was taken captive.
The car has not been found.
Curse of the Joy Brigade - The Terrible Fate of the Gleestars
English: The theory has gained traction on the Internet that a curse lies over the series about the Joy Squad, as actress Naya Rivera drowned in California recently, thereby becoming the third main actor of the series to lose their life far too young.
The episodes about the cheerleading team (i.e. Glee) are a popular series featuring singing, dancing, and joy.
The episodes were about a so-called youth entertainment group in high school, their love lives, and their destinies.
English: It was not always easy to be in the joy squad, but through song and dance, the characters seemed to overcome whatever situations they encountered in their lives.
But away from the filming locations, great misfortunes have befallen the actors and staff of the show, so much so that theories have arisen suggesting a curse rests on the series.
English: Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez in the show, a cheerleader who didn't call her grandmother anything much.
After the series had run its course, Rivera started dating actor Ryan Dorsey and had their first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her spouse and they separated shortly after.
English: Dorsey, however, refused to file a complaint and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8th, it was announced that Rivera had been reported missing after her four-year-old son was found alone on a drifting boat on Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket on board the boat and was able to tell the police authorities that he and his mother had gone for a swim and then Rivera had brought him back onto the boat but never returned there herself.
A large-scale search for Rivera began.
The day after the search began, the local police chief explained that the search was based on the assumption that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially declared dead.
It is believed that she encountered a strong current in the water and used her last strength to save her son.
The cause of death was recorded as drowning from an accident.
English: Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the series, the American football player with the angelic voice who played a key role in bringing the Glee Club to success and respect.
English: Outside of the episodes, Moneith still wrestled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and it proved difficult to escape it.
In 2013, his colleagues in the show had enough, intervened and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then underwent treatment and everything seemed to be heading in a better direction.
English: Only two months after finishing the treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after having gone out to have fun with friends.
The poison turned out to be a deadly mix of drugs and alcohol.
It was not considered that it was an act of will in question.
Mon-eith had undergone treatment and his tolerance for narcotic substances had decreased so much that a dose he had previously tolerated well, proved to be fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he lost his life.
English: His passing weighed heavily on his colleagues, but at the insistence of his co-star, Lea Michele, it was decided to continue filming the episodes and dedicate an entire episode to the memory of Moneith and his character Finn.
English: Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the series. Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his classmates in the Glee Club, or until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles, suspected of possessing child pornography.
During a house search at his home, an enormous amount of child pornography was found and the case quickly became public knowledge.
It was clear that Salling had been ready.
English: He was subsequently charged and convicted for his crimes.
He faced four to seven years in prison, in addition to having to be registered as a sex offender and seeking treatment for pedophilia.
English: Before the judge had determined the punishment, Salling, who was then out on bail, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
English: It was not only the actors of the show who left long before their time.
English: Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the episodes.
He suddenly passed away in his sleep in 2013, only 41 years old.
English: A woman named Nancy Motes also worked on the episode.
She was the younger sister of the mega star Julia Roberts and didn't speak kindly of her sister as she accused Roberts of being dominating and having a disrespectful attitude.
Motes took her own life in 2014, as she struggled with severe depression.
English: She left a letter to her lover, where she accused her mother and sister, among others, of being responsible for how she was treated.
"My mother and so-called siblings get nothing from me except the memory that they were the ones who caused my worst depression."
English: Lea Michele was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of subjecting her co-stars to bullying and abuse on set and having an excessively aggressive attitude.
English: Jesse Luken played a guest role in the series in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which caused great outrage.
English: Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the series.
She experienced in the year 2010 that unscrupulous computer hackers gained access to her nude photos and published them on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both starred in the show and had a romantic relationship outside of it.
English: Benoist later reported that Jenner had subjected her to violence in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything
It increases the maturity of children when they get to play outside in the garden with their parents, cultivating flowers and watching them grow and flourish.
It is also endlessly possible to do with flowers, as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel suggests.
Just having a moment with the children in the garden is something that is never forgotten.
English: They will remember the flowers, the fragrance, and of course, the precious time they had with their parents.
Bought a boat after tenth grade
English: "I don't think there are many sailors who work at the country's kindergartens," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who practices shore fishing in the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter time."
Beach fishing is a very convenient summer job when you are studying.
If fishing is successful, it is possible to have good earnings, and I think it's great to be able to avoid taking student loans.
The income suits me well into the winter,“ says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student, who goes shore fishing in the summer as in previous summers.
English: Axel had recently arrived at the pier in Tálknafjörður when a journalist managed to speak with him late in the evening at the beginning of the week.
English: "The winter I was in tenth grade, I obtained a boat license for boats under twelve meters long, and I bought my boat the summer after I finished elementary school."
I have been fishing from my boat every summer since.
I bought the used boat from my acquaintance, Hartmann Jónsson, and I named the boat after him.
English: Hartmann had become an adult when I bought the boat and stopped going to sea, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann passed away a few years after I took over the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
"I made an agreement with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of summer and the other half at the end of summer when I would be done fishing.
English: So, I owned the boat without any debt by the end of my first summer on it.
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay for a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
English: "I had saved up and gathered money, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I spent the whole summer fishing with him and got my share."
I also put my confirmation money into my boat fund.
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, where all his mother's family is from, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
English: "I can fish here in the western region because my legal residence is at my grandmother's in Ísafjörður."
English: I learned in this area here to the west by rowing with dad.
English: I move between fjords depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers the entire Westfjords.
Even though I prefer being in the west, I have also visited around the Snæfellsnes peninsula and beyond.
English: "I have also fished in the south, mostly for haddock," says Axel, who always rows alone early in the morning and claims to sometimes talk to the seagulls and sing to the sky, while spending time alone out on the open sea.
"The internet connection out at sea is good, so I can make calls, listen to podcasts, and music."
I don't mind being alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid getting into danger, but certainly, there have been a few occasions where something has been amiss, but never any serious risk," says Axel, who is fortunate to never get seasick.
He says the length of the workday depends on how the catch goes each time.
"In shore fishing, I never spend more than 14 hours fishing at once, but I also fish in other systems, such as leasing quotas, and then I have been continuously fishing for one and a half days at sea."
The arrangement in shore fishing, he says, is such that he is allowed to catch 770 kilograms per day, which he finds restrictive.
English: "Other restrictions are that I cannot fish on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I can only fish for twelve days a month, during these four months that beach fishing takes place, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days based on the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to row instead of having 48 days throughout the whole summer and being able to choose according to their preference.
English: The regional division could also go my way, and well-located fishing spots near fishing centers should be allowed to enjoy it," says Axel, who mostly catches cod from the salty sea in his coastal fishing, but also a bit of ling and a few other floating species.
Axel works during the winter time with his university studies at the Núpi kindergarten in Kópavogur.
English: "I think there are not many sailors who work in the kindergartens of the country," says Axel proudly, adding that he had only intended to work temporarily at the kindergarten.
English: "I committed to it because I find this job wonderful."
I hope that the psychology studies will be useful for me at the kindergarten level in the future," says Axel, who is also well advanced in his business studies.
A registration error prevented the homecoming infection screening
Mistake in the registration form that people fill out when they arrive in the country caused an individual, residing here, not to be called back for sampling.
English: It is not a requirement to register an ID number if the person fills out the form in English, just as it is when it is done in Icelandic.
English: "This will be examined during the week," says an expert in the field of infection prevention at the Chief Epidemiologist's office.
Three domestic infections were identified at the Virology Department of the National Hospital yesterday.
One of them who tested positive arrived in the country on July 15th, two days after the rules for so-called homecoming infection control took effect.
Those who were living in Iceland are then screened upon arrival to the country and invited for sampling four to five days later.
It was reported in RÚV's noon news that the person concerned had, however, followed the old system.
The demonstration at the borders was negative and he was not called back for screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert in the field of infection control at the Directorate of Health, says in an interview with the news agency that this can be traced back to an error in the digital registration form.
Filling out the registration form in English is not a requirement to include the personal identification number, unlike in the Icelandic version.
Finally, it was primarily intended for foreign tourists.
English: Therefore, the person concerned has not received an automatic invitation to come for a sampling.
English: Kamilla says that many people have followed the rules regarding domestic infection control upon returning home, even though they have registered in English and in some cases, employers have also been vigilant in sending people for testing again after arriving in the country.
"This will be examined during the week how to facilitate people's access to this and draw their attention to the process."
The man is in isolation and six have been placed in quarantine.
English: They all go to get tested, but two had already started showing symptoms.
Infection tracing is now underway for the three cases that were diagnosed yesterday, but it is mostly completed for the two infections that were reported on Friday.
In both cases, the analysis of Icelandic Genetics has revealed that there are mutations of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the other case, the ties have been directed towards Israel, although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says that it should be clear tomorrow where the virus is coming from.
English: In total, there are now 15 people in isolation according to the COVID.is website.
English: 135 are in quarantine.
Four out of five infections unrelated
Five domestic infections have been detected in the country in recent days.
Of those, four are completely unrelated and for example, the origin of the infection that emerged at the Rey Cup sports event yesterday has not been found yet.
Infection tracking is still ongoing.
Originally, there were over thirty individuals in quarantine, but their number was reduced to sixteen.
In total, there are 34 in quarantine due to these new infections detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period that infection has been detected at a sports event, and it has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, communications director at the Civil Protection Department of the National Police Commissioner, says it is quite possible, as long as people follow guidelines and rules.
"We are constantly emphasizing to everyone who lives here that it is necessary to maintain individual infection protection measures.
We also need to remind people organizing events that there are specific rules in place that must be followed.
Then it is possible to hold an event,“ says Jóhann.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by maintaining individual infection protection measures in the air.
Rules and standards are also constantly under review.
English: "What needs to be done, and what the Civil Protection Department and the Chief Medical Office are constantly emphasizing for people, is to focus on these individual infection protection measures."
Both at home and similarly at service companies.
English: That people wash their hands and use sanitizer.
English: "It prevents the infection from spreading," says Jóhann.
"We need to emphasize to people the importance of continuing on the good journey we have been on, in order to maintain the success we have achieved so far."
English: 40% of COVID-19 victims had type 2 diabetes
Devon Brumfield heard through the phone how hard her father was struggling to breathe.
Her father had diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical assistance.
The day after, he was deceased.
The death was attributed to sudden respiratory difficulties due to coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was identified on the death certificate as an underlying issue, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that the same fate awaits him.
English: Reuters news agency says Brumfield's fear is not unfounded.
English: Numbers from a new study that US authorities have commissioned show that nearly 40% of those who died had type 2 diabetes as an underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached 65 years of age is examined, the proportion rises to half.
English: The investigation of the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) involved more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus during the period from February to May.
English: Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease specialist at the CDC, says the results are striking, not least for those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.
English: The slow growth was folded in a Reuters survey and the answers from those 12 countries that responded to comparable proportions.
10 states, including California, Arizona, and Columbia, are not yet starting to report on underlying diseases.
English: "Diabetes was already an epidemic of slow growth.
English: Now, COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful wave," Reuters quotes Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among black people and those of South American origin, who have also fared worse from the coronavirus.
One of the best defenses for those with type 2 diabetes is to manage the disease in stages with physical exercise, a healthy diet, and the assistance of healthcare professionals.
The coronavirus pandemic, however, has made it difficult for many people to maintain a routine.
Then the high price of insulin has forced some to continue going to work and thus risk being exposed to the virus.
English: Reuters points out that US authorities may have been aware of the risks that those with type 2 diabetes could face from the virus.
English: During the SARS coronavirus outbreak in 2003, approximately 20% of those with the disease were at risk, and during the swine flu pandemic in 2009, this group was three times more likely to require hospitalization.
English: When MERS appeared in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
English: Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that due to the impact of the COVID-19 virus, the pandemic could reveal a number of previously unknown complications if it lasts longer.
"I fear that we will see a wave of problems when this is over," says Andrew Bolton, chairman of the International Association of Diabetic Patients.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus pandemic could indirectly lead to an increase in complications related to diabetes, including kidney diseases and kidney failure.
English: Recent research suggests that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in diabetes cases.
Reuters reports that scientists are trying to understand the connection between the coronavirus and Type 2 diabetes.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs, and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
Then, a high proportion of glucose and lipids in diabetic patients can cause a so-called "cell signaling storm", as it is called when the immune system reacts too harshly and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can cause life-threatening blood clots.
"This is all one big jigsaw puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
"This is all interconnected."
The news has been corrected.
"We were offered champagne, then they left the room"
English: The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason received the unusual request from the artist Ragnar Kjartansson to engage in sexual intercourse in front of a camera for a piece the artist was setting up in Paris.
"We loved each other so much that this was not complicated."
Atli Bollason never forgets the first time he met his wife and mother of his child, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir.
English: "I became very captivated by her."
Of course, it was just the radiation, but then I also thought she was incredibly sweet.
And he still thinks so," he says.
Ásrún also remembers this, as her husband regularly brings up their first meeting.
English: "I am always hearing this story."
English: "Just last weekend," she says, who was also attracted to her husband at first acquaintance.
English: "I found and still find so much wonder surrounding Atli, whom I like."
There is a lot going on and much happening, and I am fascinated by it.
English: Atli says that the couple has emphasized in their relationship to go their own separate ways.
"We do not tie our bags with the same knots as our fellow travelers."
We avoid routines that we identify around us.
It is possibly the reason that they welcomed the message from Ragnar Kjartansson, the visual artist, with open arms, even though it was, to say the least, unusual.
"Kristín Anna, our mutual friend, contacts us and asks if we can come to eat dessert with her, Ragga, and Ingibjörg, Ragnar's wife, at Snaps."
English: They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps and had dessert wine and a dessert each.
They listened to Ragnar who led them through his plans for an art exhibition that he intended to set up in Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
English: "He had a multi-faceted video work called Scenes from Western Culture."
English: He described it in a simple way.
Ásrún says that he described the work as banal and decadent scenes from the everyday life of Westerners.
English: "He had sketches of all the scenes he intended to shoot, and finally, he told us about what he wanted to know if we would be interested in participating in."
The scene that Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was supposed to depict a young middle-class couple in love in a minimalist room.
"This is a journey with a beginning and an end," says Atli.
English: The couple did not know Ragnar well, even though they knew about him and he about them, "but they knew us and thought we fit into this.
They had agreed that they did not want to advertise for people.
English: Maybe they thought they would not get the right people, but rather people who obtained sexual pleasure from performing for others.
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to consider the matter, but it did not take a long time.
"When we walked out of Snaps we said: Aren't we just ready for this?
English: It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and his entire team,“ says Ásrún, and Atli agrees.
"This is about love and closeness"
The scene was filmed in a nice apartment on Mýrargata.
There was a very small film crew; a cameraman, Ragnar, a sound technician, and a couple.
English: After the recording had started, everyone left the room to wait outside in the car except for Atli and Ásrún.
English: "We had not yet decided how we were supposed to be.
English: We got some small instructions, but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be clueless about what we were doing and for whom.
There was no game, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Ásrún.
But was this romantic?
"Yes, this was a bit romantic," says Atli, and Ásrún agrees.
English: "We were offered champagne before they left the room."
This was a bit like being on vacation at a nice hotel in Paris.
The team was pleased with the couple's performance in the project that moved them.
"When Tommi, the cameraman, watched this, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful," says Atli.
"This is just as much about love and intimacy as it is about the journeys themselves," says Ásrún.
The parents of the couple have seen the artwork, and Atli says that his mother heard the voice in the son at the Reykjavik Art Museum and then realized that he was a part of the artwork.
"Then she turns around and starts thinking about this," says Atli.
English: "Mom and dad saw this in Paris."
We hadn't told anyone about this, but then dad just sends me a message and says: "Nice to bump into the little family in Palais de Tokyo," Ásrún recalls.
And did participation in the project deepen the connection between Ásrún and Atli?
English: "At least we are still together, so maybe this deepened something."
At least this deepened my connection with my extended family," says Ásrún, laughing.
English: Ásrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.
"I found it a bit difficult not being with you but with someone else," she says and turns to her husband.
"But it was fun to see this because this is just one scene in a much larger work and when you saw this with the other works, it's very impressive."
I managed to break away from this a little bit and was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach," says Ásrún, who was pregnant with the couple's second child when the scene was filmed.
"This was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked with Ásrún and Atli on Love Stories on Rás 1.
Swansea with a victory in the first semi-final match
English: Swansea won 1-0 victory over Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the teams' first game in the play-off semi-finals to advance to the English Premier League.
The game took place at Swansea's home ground in Wales.
English: The score at halftime was 0–0.
Home players in Swansea received a penalty in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew broke the deadlock from the penalty spot and defended himself.
Only two minutes later, Rico Henry, a Brentford player, received a red card.
English: Brentford played the rest of the game with one less player, and in the 82nd minute, Swansea players took advantage of the difference in team numbers.
English: Andre Ayew made up for the penalty mistake by scoring a fantastic goal and secured a 1-0 victory for Swansea.
Swansea leads 1-0 in the duel, but the second match will take place next Wednesday at Brentford's home ground.
Ambassador-free for five years from the year 2009
English: Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the American ambassador to Iceland, is in the media spotlight after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard as he feared for his life.
However, it has not been without difficulties for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador here in the country.
Since Carol Van Voorst left her post as the US ambassador in April 2009, the country has been without an ambassador for a total of 62 months, more than five years.
English: Van Voorst resigned from office under peculiar circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she was supposed to receive the Order of the Falcon.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a phone call from the presidential office stating that she would not be honored with the order.
After she left Iceland, she taught international relations at the Army War College.
English: Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor started working, in September 2010.
To some extent, it can be traced back to Robert S. Connan having been appointed as an ambassador, but then he quit.
English: Finally, Loius Ariega took over the job, having worked in the foreign service for several decades.
He left his job in the fall of 2013 and took up the position of ambassador in Guatemala.
English: Then another period without an ambassador began.
English: Robert Barber received the approval of the United States Congress in January 2015 and began working shortly thereafter, but at that time there had been no ambassador at the post for 13 months.
Barber was a political appointee, but not a diplomat; instead, he had worked as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama's election fund.
He left his duties as soon as Donald Trump took office as President on January 20, 2017, as is customary with politically appointed ambassadors.
English: The Trump administration was unusually slow to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking officials in the Washington government system.
English: Two years passed until the United States Congress summoned Jeffrey Ross Gunter to their meeting to question him thoroughly and confirm him afterwards as the ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony at the parliament, he said he had never been to Iceland but often to Western Europe, while his late wife was said to be of Dutch origin.
Gunter is politically appointed, was previously a dermatologist in California, and has been prominent in the Jewish associations in the Republican Party, Republican Jewish Coalition.
Casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded the association, but Adelson is a fervent supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter started working in Iceland in May 2019, but by then, no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest such example in Iceland.
English: The reason is both how long Trump's administration took to appoint people to key positions, and in recent years the work of the US Congress has been taking a long time, including confirming ambassadors to their posts.
Since 2009, there has therefore been a total of over five years without an ambassador in Iceland.
However, that has not prevented the execution of projects on behalf of the embassy, which recently opened headquarters at Engjateig.
The construction is estimated to have cost around 6.5 billion, and thick security walls surround the building, with bulletproof glass in all the windows.
It seems, however, that this has not been enough to satisfy the current ambassador's sense of security, as he is said to fear for his life and has requested an armed bodyguard.
Former ÍBV player experienced racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
English: Tonny Mawejje, former ÍBV player, says he experienced racism while in Iceland and regrets coming to the country.
This is mentioned in an interview with Tonny, which was published in the Ugandan media outlet Daily Monitor.
English: Tonny recently joined the team Uganda Police FC, which plays in the top division of Uganda.
In the interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny discusses many things, among them his time in the country where he played with ÍBV, Valur and Þróttur in Iceland.
"When I came to Iceland, I didn't play in the middle as I was used to playing.
English: The team's captain was in that position, but in addition, he also had the jersey number I wanted, so I didn't get either of the things I wanted," says Tonny, who played on the right-wing during the game time with ÍBV.
Among the topics Tonny discusses is the racism he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
"Once this happened to me, but since I didn't understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me."
English: Later on I heard about the matter and then I asked my friend what the issue was about.
He told me then that my opponent had made racist comments about me after I tackled him.
In 2014, Tonny from Iceland went to Norway, where he joined the team in Haugesund.
There, he is said to have made the mistakes he regrets the most.
Tonny had not managed to make it into the starting lineup for Haugesund, but he wanted to play more in order to get into the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but then he joined forces with Val.
English: "It was a mistake to return to Iceland on a loan."
English: "I think if I had stayed longer in Norway, I would have gotten the opportunity I wanted," says Tonny, who hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would probably go further.
He seems to think that the loan to Iceland has ruined his dreams of joining a major team in Europe.
Found a snake in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 cm long black worm in the salivary gland of a woman who sought treatment there.
English: Doctors managed to pull the worm out with forceps.
The investigation revealed that it was a parasite in question.
English: CNN reports on this.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days earlier, which are thin slices of meat.
The woman recovered quickly after the worm was removed, but parasites like this are often found in raw meat or fish.
English: After sushi gained popularity in Western countries, cases where parasites have infected people have increased, according to CNN.
Fear that another wave is starting in Europe
Spain is now in the spotlight in connection with concerns about a second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, where authorities have taken measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic once again.
In Catalonia, all entertainment life has been put on hold for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also taken measures due to the increase in infections in Spain, but in the UK everyone has to go into quarantine upon returning from Spain, similar to in Norway, and the French have been warned against traveling to Spain.
Infections are also increasing again in France and Germany, where authorities are trying to strike a balance between curbing the spread of the virus and restarting the economy.
The situation in Europe is good compared to other places in the world, but new infections worldwide are approaching 300 thousand per day, with the majority of cases in America and South Asia.
Confirmed infections have reached 16 million worldwide, according to a count by Johns Hopkins University, and confirmed deaths linked to the virus have become 644 thousand.
Mosaic artwork of Gerður finally gets to be fully enjoyed
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavik is a large and deep cave.
Above her, there are people with orange helmets.
There is also a large grave.
And more small work machines.
The road is closed to traffic.
But the path is passable, and many now stop and admire the artwork made from millions of mosaic tiles - as if they had never seen it before.
English: Maybe they have never seen it before.
At least not considered it for themselves.
The work has been quite hidden so far, right in front of it were parking spaces that were always occupied.
English: People stopped there, quickly locked their cars, and then set off to run their errands in the city center.
"Lively and diverse public spaces" and "attractive urban landscape" are guiding principles for the reconstruction of Tryggvagata, which is currently underway.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow Gerður Helgadóttir's mosaic work on the Customs House to be better appreciated.
In front of the construction there will be a square, and since the area is well exposed to the sun, it is considered suitable as a resting area for travelers.
The artwork will be illuminated and now the material can be enjoyed better than before on this 142 square meter surface.
In the area, there will also be small "fog sprayers", a kind of water sculptures, which offer play and give the area a certain mysterious charm.
With this approach, the improvements are described by Reykjavik City, which is responsible for the implementation along with Veitur.
The water supply, heating supply, and electricity supply systems will be renewed.
Many of them have reached their years, but the school pool and the cold water pool date from 1925 and have therefore served residents and businesses in the downtown area for almost a century.
When the street is reopened after the completion of the construction work, cars can drive on it again.
But it will become a one-way street and at the same time create a calmer and more accessible space for pedestrians.
In the knowledge about the Custom House on the website of the customs director, it says that the house was put into use in 1971 and its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Due to the harbor warehouse extending through the house, a 250 square meter windowless wall surface was formed facing the street.
English: The building committee and architect agreed that such a flat surface would have a negative impact on the overall street view if special measures were not taken to enhance the appearance of the house.
The parties thus agreed to assume that a permanent piece of art would be installed there.
At that time, there was much talk about Gerður Helgadóttir, an artist, according to the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaic artworks in Germany and beyond.
The suggestion was to contact her first before deciding whether there would be a competition for the project.
Often it had been discussed that the work needed to reflect the life at the harbor, as the harbor had been the lifeline of Reykjavik since its construction.
When the artist was interviewed, she became quite fascinated by such a work.
English: It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she left the country again since she would be working on the proposals abroad.
Gerður got the time she decided herself was needed, and when she returned home, she put forward several suggestions for discussion.
It was immediately agreed to ask her to do the work.
At the same time, there was a request to make a total contract with her and the famous art company in Germany, Brothers Oidtmann, because Gerður had long collaborated with them on the installation of famous artworks across Europe.
The agreements were reached and Gerður completed the artwork under the installation at the brothers' workshop, who then took care of the installation at the Customs House.
All the work was exceptionally well resolved, both on behalf of Gerður Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann brothers, according to the summary.
Has it ever since withstood the harsh Icelandic weather.
It took Gerði about two years to complete the work, which was done and set up in the years 1972 and 1973.
The artist passed away two years after the Customs House project was completed, only 47 years old.
Prepares the relocation of more institutions to the countryside
English: Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs, announces that more public institutions will be relocated to the countryside soon.
English: The minister said this in the Sprengisandi show on Bylgjan at noon.
Recently, it was announced that the fire safety department of the Housing and Building Authority will be moved to Sauðárkrókur in the autumn.
Six fire safety experts work at the institution, but none of them plan to accompany the institution to the north, and the National Association of Firefighters and Ambulance Workers has criticized the relocation of resources.
English: "I think we should take further steps in this existence."
I am preparing further steps for this project.
"Further transport," said Ásmundur.
He claims to be convinced that a large majority of the nation wants to see greater distribution of public institutions across the country.
"I think there needs to be further political decisions made about moving public institutions to the countryside, just like I did with the Housing and Construction Authority," said Ásmundur, who also cited examples of other institutions that have been relocated to rural areas and had a significant impact on local communities, such as the relocation of the Food Administration to Selfoss, the Icelandic Surveyors to Akranes, and unemployment insurance to Skagaströnd.
English: All the main highlights from the second day of the Masters Tournament
English: The 94th Icelandic Athletics Championships concluded today at Thorsvollur in Akureyri.
English: Some objections were raised on the second day of the competition.
English: An exciting competition in women's hammer throw was expected at Þórsvöllur, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set an Icelandic record in hammer throw in 2014, which lasted until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR improved the record in May last year.
English: Vigdís won the Icelandic Championship earlier this summer and has been in fantastic form lately, having broken the Icelandic Championship record three times so far this summer.
English: Elísabet Rut has been struggling with injuries and did not manage to compete today.
She only had one valid throw out of five, threw 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the furthest of everyone today, measuring 60.08 meters in her last attempt and setting a competition record in the process.
Her Icelandic record she set earlier in July is 62.69 meters, so she was still quite far from it.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from ÍR had the second best throw of the day as she improved her personal best with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's category, FH athlete Hilmar Örn Jónsson, the Icelandic record holder in hammer throw, secured a comfortable victory as he threw 73.84 meters in his second to last throw and set a competition record.
His Icelandic record in the event is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, an Olympic participant and Iceland record holder in discus throw, won a shot put competition at Þórsvöllur yesterday, but today he competed in discus throw, which is his main event.
Icelandic National record of Guðni Valur is 65.53 meters, but today he threw his longest at 59.13 meters and secured the victory.
English: Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second longest today, but he had one valid throw that was enough for 2nd place, 49.43 meters.
English: Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, Iceland's record holder in long jump, won the long jump competition with a great margin as Hafdís jumped 6.25 meters today, which is just under 40 cm from her Icelandic record.
In the women's 200 meter race, it was the Icelandic athlete Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was the strongest, finishing with a time of 24.04 seconds, while her Icelandic record in the event stands at 23.45 seconds.
English: Guðbjörg Jóna was successful in Akureyri as she won two gold medals yesterday, in the 100 meters race and in the 4 x 100 meters relay, and also in the 4 x 400 meters relay today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH came first in the 200-meter race with a time of 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Máni Samúelsson from Ármann.
English: Just like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 meters yesterday as well as in the 400 meter race.
Cannot be fined for 27 million krona Bitcoin harvest
The Tax Appeals Committee has rejected the demand of the tax investigation director who sought a penalty against an individual for underreporting their financial income resulting from the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
The committee comes to the conclusion that the tax investigation director has not provided clear reasons for why it would be necessary to fine the individual.
In the committee's decision, it is stated that the tax investigation director believed the man had submitted substantially incorrect tax returns for the income years 2016 and 2017.
English: He would have underreported his capital gains, which were derived from the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, amounting to 27 million, either intentionally or due to gross negligence.
The sect should punish the person for their arrogance.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
English: However, he managed to sell cryptocurrency for 27 million in 2016.
He could have acquired it with a miner in the years 2009 and 2010, when it would have been both easy and inexpensive with a regular home computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the cryptocurrency, the tax implications of such a sale had been significantly unclear and unpredictable.
It could hardly have been expected that ordinary citizens would realize such provisions in the tax proposal.
English: He had not intended to avoid paying taxes on the harvest and had declared his property as a deposit on a foreign currency account in advance.
English: He would have inquired with both knowledgeable people and the Director of Internal Revenue about how this would be done, but without success.
Then he believed that it was necessary to consider the fact that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
English: He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to familiarize himself with the complex rules that the tax authorities had not formed a clear opinion on.
The man therefore considered it fair that his taxes for these two income years would be re-evaluated and a penalty applied, but otherwise no punishment would be imposed.
Then he reiterated that he lived in Iceland and had been paying taxes here in the country since 2012.
He never intended to evade his duties in a disobedient manner.
The demand for a fine would be excessive and would plunge him into debt.
Brynjolfur raises discussion: "This man understands what football is"
Brynjolfur Andersen Willumsson has been a topic of discussion among people due to his impressive performance with Breidablik in the Pepsi Max League this season.
Glimpses will be on the frontline tonight when they take on IA in a live broadcast on Channel 2 Sport.
English: Brynjólfur receives a suspension due to four warnings during the playtime and therefore does not play with a new haircut like in the games of the summer so far.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his forehead for the game against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
"I don't know exactly who he was responding to with the payment, but speaking of character, this one was rather trying in the game."
He did not go into hiding.
English: He wants to get the ball every single time, and if anyone was going to even out this game, I thought he would do it or make it happen," said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max studio, when the conversation turned to Brynjólfur.
"I am supposed to be here for the people."
"It is difficult sometimes to understand in what situation he is in.
English: He looks a bit to the left side when the game starts, but he has a very free role in the team," said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Thorkell Máni Pétursson says Brynjólf is a real entertainer and welcomes having such a colorful person in the division: "No one disputes that this is a character.
This is a fun character and I love this with the hair, and being always ready to meet and respond in interviews.
There is an incredible amount of people fascinated by him, which tells me that this man understands what football is all about.
"I am an entertainer."
I am supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it.
English: People are reading the interviews with Brynjólf, people are paying to enter and follow what is next on his agenda.
English: "This man is just a genius," said Máni.
KR player says he wants to leave the club - "I have been in contact with several teams in the B-division"
Tobias Thomsen, a player for KR in the Pepsi Max League, seems to be on his way out of the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to go back home to Denmark.
English: Fótbolti.net also reported on the matter.
English: Tobias wants to make the beginning of the season in his home country, but first he needs to terminate his contract with KR since the Danish division starts before the Icelandic one ends.
The club knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me great understanding,“ said Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
"I have been in contact with several teams in the B-division and will likely switch over before the Icelandic season ends."
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay for my contract with KR."
Then he says that he probably needs to accept a pay cut in Denmark.
"Organizations in Denmark have probably experienced more economic impacts from the virus than in Iceland."
The bicycle whisperer Bjartmar has recovered bicycles worth millions - Now responds after coverage by DV
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.
He recovers and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes, and scooters.
English: Has Bjartmar earned himself the nickname "the bicycle whisperer" for a reason.
Yesterday, there was quite a stir when a man published a account of his interactions with Bjartmar.
DV then referred to discussions in a Facebook group of West Town residents, where it was revealed that Bjartmar had approached the man in East Square and said the scooter might possibly be stolen.
There was no other way to read the original writings of the electrician than to conclude that Bjartmar had accused him of theft.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original DV news has been updated accordingly.
English: Bjartmar says that the original news about the matter does not at all describe what actually happened yesterday at Austurvöllur.
English: Bjartmar claimed to have received information from a victim of electric scooter theft that these were indeed his electric scooters.
English: The alleged owner received that information from others, but the information turned out to be wrong, says Bjartmar.
English: "I looked towards the rock and examined the shuttle, as I had information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and had been searched for.
English: I definitely hesitated at first, but when I saw him preparing to take off on the scooter, I decided to cool down and talk to the man.
The owner was certain in his case, and therefore I decided to have a conversation with the man.
English: Generally, I handle such matters quite well, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken the word from me.
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric scooter barely asked him to show him the receipt for the bicycle and even called the police himself.
"Yes, great," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this sorted out."
So it happened that the owner of the electric scooter proved ownership of their electric scooter and took off.
English: Later, the rightful owner of the electric scooter shared their story on Facebook, similar to what was reported in the previous news article.
In this spacious year that Bjartmar has spent on this practice of his, he says he can count the times he came into conflict with people on the fingers of one hand.
"I have had peaceful interactions with the most difficult people in Reykjavik," said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are often the least regarded brothers and sisters of society - addicts, mentally disabled people, and others who, for some reason, are on the streets.
"Addiction is a harsh master and somehow, there needs to be financing for the next dose, unfortunately, stealing such loose assets is an easy way to achieve that goal," says Bjartmar.
English: "My interactions with these people are actually so good that I have many of those good people on my team."
Examples exist of people who have undergone treatment and improved themselves, and then sought me out and assisted me with what I am doing," he says.
In general, Bjartmar's interactions with cyclists are on polite terms.
Some know about him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, bicycle serial numbers, and so on.
Bicycle theft is a big problem that has received little attention.
Moreover, Bjartmar says that the police have even started suggesting people to talk to him because of stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with the previous news coverage of DV and claims not to be some kind of self-appointed police in a personal search for justice.
English: When asked whether he may now be on thin ice with his actions, and whether this is primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says that it is indeed so.
"Of course the police should do this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are simply not taking care of it.
English: For example, I have seen police officers drive away from a large pile of stolen bicycles.
English: She is, quite frankly, hopeless in these matters.
"When the police aren't doing anything about this, and it's just right in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can achieve results in this type of case, then why not?" asks Bjartmar.
English: He claims to have achieved such great success in recovering stolen bicycles that sometimes he bumps into his "protégés" on the street who have just managed to get their bikes back from Bjartmar, which they had previously lost.
The times that Bjartmar has called for police assistance have occurred because they simply didn't show up.
English: "This is just not working with the police, and it is not my fault and it is not the fault of the bicycle owners," said Bjartmar and thinks it's sad that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer due to the negligence of the police in dealing with these types of cases.
There is no dispute about Bjartmar's success.
English: Widely, stories can be found of people thanking Bjartmar for having managed to return their possessions to them.
English: Bjartmar himself says that he has long since lost count of the number of bikes he has returned, but the amount obviously runs into the millions, if not tens of millions.
English: Electric scooters, electric bicycles, and electric shuttles are heavy, but an electric bicycle can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works at a kindergarten during the day and every other weekend he works at a communal residence.
His bike path is therefore unpaid work that he devotes himself to in his free time.
Pension funds and long shadows
English: The year 2019 was a significant anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
English: Although officials had indeed received pensions from the Danish king since the 19th century, in 1919 a civil servant pension fund was established, which eventually became the pension fund for all public employees.
The foundation of the current pension funds for general wage earners was then laid with the all-encompassing collective wage agreements in the labor market in 1969, which stipulated an employment-related pension fund with mandatory membership and full-fledged fund collection starting from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were then enacted on the basis of these agreements, and the life insurance system continued to strengthen after that.
The pension system for wage earners was not the only radical change that the 20th-century labor movement pushed forward with its wage struggle.
Unemployment insurance had been obtained in a similar manner in the historic strike struggles of 1955, and the unions also gradually advanced their demands for sick leave rights, a health fund, significant vacation rights, shortened working hours, improvements in housing issues, and other such matters of great importance.
All these rights came at a great and fierce struggle, but in retrospect, proved to be a much greater and more lasting wage improvement than the multiplication of coins in the wage package, which disappeared just as quickly into the heat of the inflation that characterized the period after the war and up until 1990, as many will remember.
The process leading up to the establishment of general pension funds in 1969 was both lengthy and complex.
English: Although people eventually agreed that the funds should in reality be owned by the fund associations, the labor movement had to accept that their boards should be appointed by equal representatives of employers and fund associations.
In the following years after the establishment of the funds, the demand for a majority of workers in the management of the funds was often debated in the wage earners' associations, but it never succeeded, and therefore we still have the unusual arrangement that representatives of the fund's members are not in the majority in the management of the funds.
In Article 36 of Act no. 129/1997 on mandatory pension rights insurance and the operations of pension funds, the investment policy of the funds is discussed.
There it says in paragraph 1 that "a pension fund must have the interests of fund members as a guiding principle."
Also, in paragraph 5 it states: "A pension fund must establish ethical guidelines for investments."
English: In the shareholder policy of the Merchant's Pension Fund, among other things, the following provisions are included, following the aforementioned legal provisions:
The pension fund is a party to the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investments, along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the West and Europe.
In the rules, it is discussed how an emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as good corporate governance practices, can contribute to improved investment performance of securities portfolios.
Thus, the interests of investors and the goals of society in a broader context come together.
English: The LV considers it important that companies, especially those listed on the stock market, adopt an official policy on: adhering to good governance practices, employment conditions, social responsibility, and environmental issues.
English: The Gildi Pension Fund, which is among the largest funds in the country, has established a "policy on responsible investments" and it contains provisions of a similar nature.
This is all brought up here as an introduction to the latest fashion word in Icelandic, "shadow management".
Since the word is new to the language, it is not expected to have been clearly defined yet, but the following definition now seems to be the most widely accepted: Shadow governance is when a union leader announces in the media that they intend to send the union's representatives to the board of a pension fund with instructions or directives on how they should decide on a particular issue.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be forced to step down from the government at the first opportunity.
English: If the leader does not bring this to the media and does not discuss resignation, then it is not "shadow management" as such communication between people is naturally always present in the financial world as well as elsewhere.
I leave it to the reader to consider which way they find "more suspicious."
English: There are mainly two men who have tried to shape this definition when this is written, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
English: They are Hörður Ægisson, a journalist at Fréttablaðið, and Ásgeir Jónsson, the central bank governor.
The occasion for both arose after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, announced his intention to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and flight staff (lay them off), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavik Merchants' Association, then issued a directive to the Association's representatives on the board of the Pension Fund of merchants not to support any possible purchase of the Fund's shares in the company, or else they might have to step down.
English: Somewhat later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and subsequently, Ragnar Þór followed suit with his own remarks, which naturally were aimed at Bogi's decision.
English: Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to discuss the matter at length in the Friday edition of Fréttablaðið, using strong words about shadow governance, legal violations, and a great need for changes in laws.
There, a small mound had to truly roll a heavy load even though the blessed mound had been in a connecting mode and, in addition to that, had been quickly dried out.
English: Since the matter is important, we should focus on the content itself in the end.
English: I dealt here earlier with those provisions in the pension fund legislation that relate to this matter.
English: It implies that fund managers must safeguard the interests of fund members and maintain ethical standards in investments, and these points are further elaborated in the regulations of both the Gildi Pension Fund and the Commerce Pension Fund, as I mentioned.
Pension funds, on the other hand, should NOT focus solely on short-term profitability goals in their investments.
Such a policy would indeed be highly dangerous, and one does not have to look far for examples in the past, where large loans from banks and funds have ended up in the hands of unscrupulous adventurers and environmental disasters, with disastrous consequences.
English: The CEO of Icelandair was clearly on thin ice when it occurred to him to wipe out an entire group of employees, thereby significantly reducing the goodwill the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he saw it coming and pulled it back.
English: Time will reveal whether the pension funds' investment in the company can be considered responsible towards the fund members when it comes down to it.

One of the infected had no homecoming transmission risk
One of the three individuals who tested positive for Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived from an Eastern European country on July 15th, about one and a half weeks ago.
He is an Icelander who is not permanently residing here and therefore did not receive clear instructions on how to undergo the so-called homecoming testing after arriving in the country and go for another test a few days after arrival.
He received a negative result from the screening at the border.
English: "But he is in Icelandic society and should really resort to that measure," says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, an expert in infection prevention at the Directorate of Health and deputy chief medical officer for infection prevention while he is on summer vacation, in an interview with Fréttablaðið today.
"He used the English registration form, and there is no obligation to register the ID number, and if the ID number is not registered, you are not automatically invited to the later show."
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he actually lives abroad, but due to his connections in the country as an Icelander, he should have rather used the Icelandic one.
He, however, had not realized this.
English: "When the social security number is not registered, you need to seek it yourself to participate in the second sample collection."
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that it was the right way,“ says Kamilla.
English: "So it is clear that we need to improve information dissemination about this while we find some way to make an automatic notification system even if Icelanders do not register their identification numbers."
English: Or to somehow make it clearer who the participants in the Icelandic society are in the registration system, "she explains.
As it turns out, the person in question managed to avoid dealing with the municipality for entry into the country, even though they are defined as a participant in Icelandic society, being an Icelander.
English: Only six have been sent to quarantine after he was diagnosed yesterday and these six were all in contact with him.
They have yet to go for testing, but two of them are already showing symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative result from his sample at the border on July 15th.
Kamilla says it is likely that he was so recently infected with the virus that it had not yet been able to be detected in him when the sample was taken at the border.
She does not want to rule out that the man may have been infected here in Iceland, rather than bringing the virus with him to the country.
English: "It is not entirely possible to claim that this is certainly an imported infection because it has been so long since he came to the country that he could have been exposed here just like these two who have caused some commotion in relation to the sports event."
English: She says, however, that it is very unlikely due to how few people the man interacted with here.
"In fact, it is quite unlikely," says Kamilla, but notes that it cannot be ruled out until Icelandic genetic research has sequenced the virus in the person.
English: "If we get a virus strain that has not been seen here before, it is almost certain that someone has brought it to the country."
Pepper spray and explosives used against protesters
A clash occurred between police and protesters in Seattle tonight.
English: Police used pepper spray and non-lethal hand grenades on protesters, but protesters broke windows and started fires.
English: 45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police brutality and racial prejudice were protested against widely in the United States last night, but the demonstrations in Seattle were in support of the protesters in Portland in the state of Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot to death.
According to BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered for peaceful protests.
English: A group of people then set fire to a construction site and broke windows in the city's courthouse.
Following that, the police said the protests were unrest and clashes occurred between groups of protesters and the police.
Demand for justice In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was killed by police in August last year, was remembered by protesters.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of supporters of the black militia gathered and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was killed by police in her home last March.
The group carried firearms and walked in formations towards the closed intersections where the police separated the group from a crowd of people who protested the protests and also carried firearms.
Then, 75 people were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters commemorated James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was killed by a white bar owner in May.
Solskjær: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Manchester United football manager, does not want to make too much of the importance of the game against Leicester today in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United loses the match, and Chelsea does not lose against Wolves, Solskjær and his men will finish in 5th place and thereby miss out on the Champions League spot.
Then they should still have hope of getting into the Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
English: "We have not reached our destination."
If we get points against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven't had a bad period," said Solskjær.
"But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have quite a way to go to catch the two teams above us," said Solskjær.
English: It is clear that people's nerves will be tense at 3 pm today, but Solskjær tried to act as if it were any other game being discussed.
"If a person wants to belong to Manchester United, they must get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season."
This is nothing new, and the company is built on this.
We have created a great opportunity for ourselves to finish the period well and now it's up to us to make use of it," said Solskjær.
"This is not the most important game of the season, this is just the next game."
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our period, we have already had many moments that define this period.
English: "The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us, and I believe that overall, we are in better shape and much stronger mentally than in the last season," said Solskjær.
65,000 infections in 24 hours
English: 65,490 new cases of the coronavirus were detected in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
In total, 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed west of the ocean since the beginning of the pandemic in that country.
English: 900 people died from the virus yesterday, but in the last four days leading up to that, the death toll from the virus was over 1,000 per day.
English: In total, 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
English: A CNN news report states that, according to the US health authorities' forecast model, the number of deaths caused by the virus will reach 175,000 by August 15th.
Fear of a second wave of the pandemic
Authorities in Spain are now trying their best to hold back the increasing spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There have not been more cases diagnosed in a single day since the beginning of May, and the news comes at the same time as Spaniards begin to ease one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe.
The setback led to British authorities now requiring passengers coming from Spain to undergo quarantine upon their return.
A week ago, Spain was on the British list of safe countries.
The situation is at its worst in Catalonia in the northeastern part of Spain, where authorities have implemented extensive restrictions to try to curb the growth.
In the capital city Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and bars must close at midnight.
Then, a curfew is now in effect for 200 thousand inhabitants in Segria county in the western part of Catalonia.
It is believed that the decision of the British will have negative impacts on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and has been badly affected by the pandemic.
Tui, the largest travel agency in the UK, cancelled all flights planned for today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the pandemic, but there seems to be little interest in resorting to the extensive lockdown measures that have widely devastated the economy.
For example, Boris Johnson, the British Prime Minister, has reacted very badly to such things and compared it to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Then Jean Castex, Prime Minister of France, has said that the nation "would not survive, economically or socially," if a nationwide lockdown were to be imposed again.
Many policymakers hope that localized solutions, which reach the residents of individual towns, cities, or regions, will be sufficient to curb the spread of the virus in the next round if it occurs.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three domestic
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday in addition to two more at the border.
English: Thus, five individuals were diagnosed with positive Covid-19 infections yesterday in Iceland.
In a Civil Protection announcement, it states that one infection is connected to the infection that was detected yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
Has that person been sent into isolation and sixteen who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
The infected person was a participant in the social activities of a sports club in Reykjavik and, according to the announcement, is "only a part of the sports team" in quarantine.
Others who were sent into quarantine are connected to the man in another way.
The origin of this infection is undiscovered, and contact tracing is in full swing by the national police commissioner's contact tracing team.
English: The organizers of the ReyCUP tournament have followed the guidelines and regulations of the Chief Epidemiologist and Civil Protection, which are still in force, and appropriate measures have been taken.
Even though the images from the match yesterday caught attention, where one could see in very close company celebrating their team's good performance on the field.
Just before 11 am today, the organizers posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
English: It says, "NOTE: Parents, please respect the rules that competitors must fetch their own equipment in the school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do that.
English: Thank you for the shown understanding.
Another infection was detected yesterday, but it is connected to the infection that was identified the day before yesterday.
The statement says: "Icelandic genetic analysis has identified the infections and a new type of virus has come to light that has not been detected here before."
Work is being done on contact tracing for that case as well, and the infected person is in isolation and 12 are in quarantine due to the infection.
English: The third infection in question is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, on July 15th.
He was located in the southwest corner of the country.
English: He is now in quarantine and six who were in close contact with him are in isolation.
English: Two of them have already started showing symptoms of viral infection.
In addition, two cases were detected at the border and further investigation results are awaited, as the procedure for infections at the border dictates.
In conclusion, the announcement states: The Civil Protection Department of the National Police Commissioner and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer urge people to exercise caution and pay close attention to individual infection prevention measures.
In case of even the slightest doubt about the presence of Covid-19 virus symptoms, the same person is asked to go for a sample collection at the nearest health center.
Patreksfjörður says the campsite is fully booked for the Merchants' Weekend - Directs guests elsewhere
The campsite in Patreksfjörður is fully booked for the weekend, according to an announcement by Vesturbyggð.
It is suggested that guests explore other accommodation options.
English: Mentions Vesturbyggð Bíldudal, Tálknafjörð, Melanes on Rauðasand, Hótel Flókalund, and Hótel Breiðavík as other options in the area.
There is plenty to do in Patreksfjordur this weekend, as the Skjaldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentaries, will be held in town just like in previous years.
She has been held since the year 2007 and has therefore become a strong tradition in the town.
Judging by the interest in the campsite, a good turnout can be expected this year, if the weather does not interfere with the plans, as DV reported earlier today of a rather uncertain forecast.
English: The worst weather can be expected in the south, and hope for the people of Patreksfjörður.
The website bb.is was the first to report, and said that all other accommodations in the town were already fully booked.
A whole apartment building crumbles down in the best area of the city
Romanian workers live freely at Dunhaga 18-20.
While owners seek building permits for renovations, their applications have been delayed in the system for nearly three years.
In one of the oldest, greenest, and most expensive neighborhoods of Reykjavik City, stands a stately three-story apartment building.
On the ground floor of the house, there is about 600 square meters of commercial space.
Behind the house, there are doors of two staircases, each of which contains four rather decent apartments.
English: They are in the range of 93-130 square meters, although most are over 100.
The house has a considerable history to hold.
It was built in 1959 and has, among other things, housed a video rental, the Shoe Store, the Milk Store of the Dairy Cooperative, Jói the gunsmith, a fish sale, and most recently the University Press.
The house has, to put it mildly, seen its share of better days.
The house is now heavily damaged, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 Ltd.
English: According to the company registry, among other owners of D18 ehf. are Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús went before the ownership group of Borgun and was the defense attorney for the property holding company Borgun.
In the group of owners of the property holding company Borgun, there is Stálskip Ltd.
Steelship Ltd. is the investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
English: Guðrún is also the owner of a one-third share in D18 Ltd.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once operated the shipping company Stálskip.
D18 Ltd. bought the house in the summer of 2009, and little to nothing has been done to maintain it since then.
English: Neighbors say that the condition of the house has steadily deteriorated since then, although most notably in recent years.
On the Facebook page of residents in the neighborhood, one resident says that the house had "not been particularly lively in the past years."
English: It is possible that over the past several years, the owners have desired to change the house and the property.
Other neighbors say the house has not been alright for a long time.
"It is long overdue to do something decent about this stain and it's annoying that this has been dragged on for so long."
He also says that he is fed up with the owners of the house for not having pushed themselves to finish this, finding some common ground with the neighbours of the house and stopping this "legal quagmire."
"Do this only in consultation with the surrounding community so that it is possible to carry this out and complete it."
English: The "legal loophole" that the resident refers to is the planning process of the area, which has been underway at least since 2017.
English: The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then sought permission to build a floor on top of the current multi-family house and behind the house, a new elevator building and an extension on one floor with an additional basement.
English: The building permit that was granted for that project was appealed to the Appeals Committee on Environmental and Natural Resources Matters, and the committee invalidated it because the project did not have support in the conflict plan and the neighborhood presentation was not satisfactory.
English: The City of Reykjavik then commenced the dispute plan work and completed it with an advertisement in the Government Gazette in July last year.
That arrangement was also criticized, and the committee abolished it in March 2020.
At this point in time, nearly three years had passed since the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the house were at the starting line.
The house had suffered significant damage during this time and neighbors were starting to get weary.
When DV asked the neighbors about the situation and the neighbors' reactions, the answers varied in different ways.
Some people understood the plans of the house owners, others not at all.
English: Some directed their anger towards the city, others not.
Others were just angry but not necessarily at anyone in particular.
Still others called the parking space a bone of contention, but neighbors have used the unused parking spaces of Dunhaga 18-20 for their vehicles.
One complainant in the case said they were fed up with the government administration:
English: "That we should have to go through the process three times is absolutely unbelievable."
It is as if the City of Reykjavik cannot read.
Today, the house stands empty, abandoned, and neglected.
Memorial of the city's aerial cable administration and the noble plans of the owner and the many years of work of those who are now at the starting point.
English: When the journalist approached the yard at Dunhaga 18, galloping animals and piles of garbage blew at him.
Playstation computer and a recent television were among the other garbage on the ground - victims of Icelandic summer discoloration.
English: The old office of Háskólaprent was open, and judging by the smell, there were quite a few cats inside.
English: It is clear that someone has made a mess in one corner but no one is visible.
Stacks of sofas and beds, and a few sheets of geological pages, which were undoubtedly meant to become a book, fluttered around.
The staircases of the apartment building were also open and there was activity in both of them.
English: A journalist was so lucky to bump into a resident of one of them.
There were Romanians boiling a potato dish for dinner and inviting a journalist in.
The Romanians work for the employment agency Ztrongforce Ltd.
They have been there for some time, and DV sources suggest that the company has paid nothing for the housing except for heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not considered justifiable to collect rent.
Judging by the traces of mail in the entrance of the house, it is clear that a number of foreign workers have been living there in the past few months.
English: The operation of employee leasing has not been spared from the Covid-19 situation, as the contraction in tourism has led to a contraction in the construction sector, and these two industries have been particularly diligent in utilizing the services of employee leasing.
English: Nevertheless, it seemed that the residents of Dunhaga 18 had plenty to do, and the work gloves and mittens were hung in the shared space to dry after a long workday in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the poor condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be reasonably well maintained.
English: When the journalist said goodbye to the Romanian boys, the irony suddenly became clear: In the best location in Reykjavik stands a 1,500 square meter property demolished.
Owners want to improve the house and neighbors want to improve the condition, but they disagree on the definition of "improvement."
English: In between sits the city's planning department at the starting point, a sacrificial lamb of endless consultation processes and complaint possibilities in the planning process, and the lengthy resolution of the Environmental and Natural Resources Dispute Committee.
In the house live Romanian workers, perhaps the ones who will improve the situation when the Icelanders stop fighting.
The article was originally published in DV's weekend edition on July 17th.
In efforts against obesity following the coronavirus pandemic
British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, will provide 10 million pounds in a campaign against obesity, which will include, among other things, a ban on fast food advertisements, following his serious illness, partly due to his weight.
It remains for Johnson to introduce the campaign, which has been named Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe bike rides for their patients in overweight and will also be tackled the increase of bike paths.
Then fast food advertisements on television will be banned before 9 pm in the evening, according to British media sources.
"COVID-19 has alerted us to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more active, and eat healthier food," according to a government spokesperson.
English: Johnson has himself struggled with weight issues, but he was admitted to intensive care when he contracted the coronavirus in the spring, and it is partly due to his weight that he is believed to have become so seriously ill.
Women better suited to lead the changes
She said that the new constitution would be the biggest step that the nation could take towards greater distribution of power, transparency, and in combating corruption and serving the interests of the whole.
English: "We need to start changing gears a little bit now, and who is better suited to lead such changes than the group in our society that has an easier time being in these values.
There are women, "said Helga.
"Women in Iceland are famous for their solidarity among women."
To stand together and be united in leading changes.
English: So now it's just up to us to lead these changes.
She said she was somewhat doubtful about the emphasis on Iceland as the "best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
English: "Then we are not as prepared to look at what needs to be done."
As the Germans are very conscious of their history and consider everything that needs to be done.
English: There is a lot.
We must know where we come from and recognize the history and listen.
Listen to the voices of marginalized groups.
We do not all live by the same rules here,“ said Helga.
English: When asked, she said that women in Iceland are in many ways in a good position, but added that, like elsewhere, Icelanders uphold extremely male-dominated values.
She said that politics revolved around, for example, self-interest, control, and power, which were the forces that maintained inequality in all societies.
"Women have now founded this group and come together and are just getting a little annoyed at the fact that the Parliament seems to constantly ignore this national referendum from 2012," she said.
English: "It is these feminine values that we are thinking about this from."
From the perspective of human rights and environmental protection, cooperation and the fact that we all really sit at the same table, "she said, adding that the aforementioned values are the fundamental values in the new constitution.
"We are a very wealthy country in terms of natural resources, and it is absurd that there are people here living in poverty."
It's ridiculous, we can exchange differently," said Helga.
"It is absurd that there should be some natural law that women's jobs are always paid less.
It is absurd that flight attendants and nurses have to constantly engage in wage struggles just to achieve decent salaries.
It is possible to sign the petition for a new constitution here through Digital Iceland.
Attempted to rob a pedestrian in downtown
A man was arrested in downtown last night after he threatened a walking passerby and tried to take money from him.
The police also stopped drug production in Árbær, where two were arrested in connection with the case.
Then the police stopped a motorcycle driver in Hlíðunum where the driver was going at 146 km/h speed where the maximum speed is 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of his driver's license.
The police in the capital area had their hands full last night, with over 80 cases registered in the police log from five in the evening yesterday to five in the morning today.
Then there was a particularly large number of noise complaints due to gatherings.
On the night before Saturday, reports were received of eleven noisy gatherings, which was considered a lot in the police diary.
English: However, tonight 22 noise complaints were reported to the police.
English: Six were imprisoned in a cell last night.
In Árbær, the police were called out tonight when individuals shot fireworks into the air.
English: They were, however, ready to defend themselves when the police officers arrived.
Then nine drivers were stopped for intoxication and/or driving under the influence of drugs.
Four were arrested due to a brawl in the city center last night, but one of them was placed in a prison cell.
English: Then two were taken to the emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the city center and the other in the western district.
One person was taken to the emergency department after being injured while jumping on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who pulled a trailer at Kjalarnes yesterday.
The bicycle equipment of the bike shed was, according to the police diary, in "very poor condition" and it was immobilized.
Possible to stay at Monet's house during the Merchants' weekend
The house, which impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life in, is now available for rent on the Airbnb website.
The next available nights in the house are during the Merchants' weekend.
The house is small and charming, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The geographer painter lived in the house from the year 1883 until he died in 1926.
In the house there are three bedrooms, two living rooms, and three bathrooms.
English: Monet first got the inspiration to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If someone intends to rent the house, they must rent it for at least two nights.
Based on the Airbnb website, it is almost available after a week, on Sunday of the Merchant's Holiday, and therefore could be ideal for some merchants on vacation to arrange booking the painter's house.
The two nights over the merchant holiday weekend cost only 964 US dollars or just over 130 thousand Icelandic krona, according to Fréttablaðið's best estimate.
English: Ten in quarantine and several of them have started to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
English: Ten people have been placed in quarantine due to this, and some of them have started to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically yesterday, and two at border screening.
A specialist at the Directorate of Health says that an increasing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading further into society.
English: "The domestic infections from before have been traced and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to believe that it has been spreading unnoticed in the community at any time.
This is probably something that has recently come to the country, but of course, we need to be very vigilant now," said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, a specialist in infection prevention at the office of the Chief Medical Officer.
Most of those infected have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
Further tests will be conducted soon, as several individuals who were in contact with the infected are starting to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
English: "Now there is no influenza going on and fewer other respiratory infections, so we can be quite liberal with doing these tests on individuals who, during the flu season, would have had reason to do something else first," said Kamilla.
Infection tracing is mostly finished, but it cannot be ruled out that more people may need to go into quarantine.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending a sports event.
Has it raised questions whether it is defensible to hold such an event.
The Civil Protection Coordinator says it is quite possible as long as people follow guidelines and rules.
Kamilla says it is almost ruled out that the infected ones were infected at the sports events.
"If no more people go into isolation from these individuals after interacting with them at these sports events, then we can assert that our infection prevention measures at the events have worked."
English: "But that has not become clear," said Kamilla.
The Civil Protection Department's procedures are under constant review.
"We need to be prepared to intervene with further recommendations or restrictions if necessary," said Kamilla.
After about a week, it is expected that the number restrictions will be expanded to a thousand people.
This new situation could affect the relaxation.
"Deliberate contemplation of cooking" - See Elísa Viðar's menu
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is an accomplished football player and plays with Val.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, a mother, and works as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for the tasks of the day and often gives herself time to cook good and nutritious food.
A normal day for me starts with arriving at work just after eight," says Elísa.
"After work, I go to the store to prepare dinner before I pick up my daughter from preschool at three o'clock."
Elísa finds it very nurturing to pick up her daughter early from preschool.
"It is good to spend time with her before I go to practice later in the day."
After practice, it is nice to come home and just have to heat up the food.
In the evening, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch an episode to clear our minds.
Elisa does not follow any specific diet.
She is putting the finishing touches on her master's thesis in nutrition and therefore knows well what suits her to eat in order to have enough energy to manage her work, school, family, and exercise.
"What suits me is to eat a varied diet that is well composed of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats."
I think it's most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not categorize it as bad or good, but rather as nutritious or nutrient-poor.
It is perfectly fine to eat everything, just not all at once and not always.
English: Elísa has a great interest in cooking.
English: "I find a certain contemplation in standing in the kitchen cooking and therefore seek it very often."
English: I have to say that self-confidence is with me in the kitchen, and I genuinely believe that I am a decent cook.
Morning meal: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, let soak in almond milk overnight.
Top this meal off with whatever is available each time.
English: Usually it's a banana and a single piece of muesli & COFFEE.
I am a big coffee lady.
In-between meals: Incredibly varied, but fruits or vegetables, flatbreads, plain skyr with banana and muesli, bread with spread, and then I could eat hummus with a spoon straight out of the box if needed.
Lunch: I often make myself all kinds of nutritious salads with whatever is available in the refrigerator, quinoa or barley, falafel balls, rocket salad, oven-baked vegetables with a good dressing is somewhat what I am working with.
If the schedule goes completely haywire (which happens often), the egg machine at work has saved me quite a few times, and then it's 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese, and a boiled egg, don't put more on yourself.
In-between meals: Get me something high in carbohydrates for training, bread with toppings, cereal or fruit.
Dinner: Fish is very often the choice at my home, otherwise some delicious vegetarian dishes.
Conflict between police and protesters in Seattle
City authorities in Seattle in the state of Washington have declared a state of uprising following numerous protests in the city center.
English: Yesterday, the police resorted to tear gas and pepper spray in an attempt to clear a large area occupied by protesters, which stretched over several blocks near the Parliament building in the city.
The police reported on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and an investigation is underway for vandalism that occurred at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of explosive.
City and police authorities say that protesters attacked the police with stones, bottles, stun grenades, and other loose objects, and one police officer was taken to the hospital where his injuries were treated.
The protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time at first.
The blowing was done to show solidarity with the protesters in Portland, Oregon, as there have been repeated instances of violent clashes between protesters and heavily armed federal police squads in the city.
There, like in many other cities in the United States, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, commemorating George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protesting against systemic racism in American society and demanding improvements.
Not revoked until after the vote
English: It is still unclear whether the resignations of those Icelandair flight attendants, which are supposed to take effect around the next month, will be withdrawn.
Digital voting on the collective bargaining agreement of the Icelandic Air Hostess Association on behalf of flight attendants at Icelandair concludes at noon tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, the chairperson of the association, says she is certain that Icelandair will not make a decision on the layoffs until the results of the vote are available.
"This definitely makes sense," says Guðlaug Líney.
"There have been no resignations withdrawn, this must be put in place so that it will be possible to man the machines."
English: So, of course, people are anxious to find out if they will have a job after the end of the month.
The vote is about an agreement that was signed a week ago, on the eve of July 19th.
It is expected that it will be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement that flight attendants had previously voted on.
English: On July 17, the administration and board of trustees of the Icelandic Flight Attendant Association approved an all-out strike at Icelandair, and the members accepted it in a vote.
To her, it never came, but this was decided in the wake of Icelandair's decision to abandon talks with the Flight Attendants' Association, dismiss all of its flight attendants and seek contracts with another union.
Then the association's pilots had to temporarily take on the tasks of security personnel on board.
English: When asked how she thinks the voting will go, Guðlaug Líney says it's hard to predict.
English: "People are hurt after this move by Icelandair, when all the company's flight attendants were laid off and informed that an agreement would be made with another union."
Now it becomes clear whether it has an impact, "she says.
In late April, 940 flight attendants worked for Icelandair, but at that time 900 of them, about 95%, were laid off.
Their notice period varies in length, for those with the shortest employment, it is three months and therefore ends around the end of July-August.
In that group, about 90% of Icelandair's flight attendants are included.
What happens if the agreement is not approved?
English: "Then we wish for ongoing discussions with our counterparts."
With this agreement, we are meeting the demands of Icelandair.
It is clear to the flight attendants that they are being rejected, as they believe they have gone too far.
Voting on the wage agreement ends and Icelandair announces the settlement of the second quarter tomorrow.
The ballot vote for flight attendants on a new collective agreement ends at 12 noon tomorrow.
English: Icelandair's financial statement for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary operating results indicate that the company's revenue has decreased by 85 percent compared to the same period last year.
Electronic voting on the collective bargaining agreement between the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association and the Confederation of Icelandic Employers regarding Icelandair began on Wednesday, 22nd July, and concludes tomorrow, Monday 27th July, at noon.
Those who can vote on the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay membership fees to the Flight Attendants' Association.
English: Icelandair and FFÍ (The Icelandic Flight Attendants' Association) signed a new collective bargaining agreement on Sunday night, July 19th. The Friday before, Icelandair had broken off negotiations with the association after the flight attendants had rejected a previous agreement in a voting process at the beginning of July.
English: Icelandair had then announced layoffs for all flight attendants and crew members of the company on Friday, but those were withdrawn after a new collective bargaining agreement was signed.
According to a new wage agreement, flight attendants must fly five times more per month for the same base salary.
The collective agreement is valid until 2025, but provisions for pilots and flight attendants on how long one can fly during a single shift have been consolidated.
The agreement was presented to the members of the FFÍ at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday, and many flight attendants that the newsroom spoke to then expressed dissatisfaction with the contract.
Most people seemed to agree, however, that the agreement had to be approved in order to keep the Icelandic Football Association (FFÍ) alive.
English: Icelandair's settlement for the second quarter will be announced tomorrow, but the company's EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), according to preliminary operating results, is negative by approximately 100 to 110 million US dollars or about 15 billion Icelandic krona.
English: Icelandair submitted emergency calculations to the Stock Exchange last Wednesday, stating that the company's revenues had decreased by about 60 million dollars in the quarter or about 8.3 billion krona.
Portable funds and their equivalent amounted to approximately 154 million US dollars at the end of the quarter, which is around 21 billion Icelandic krona.
English: Icelandair also aims to offer the company's shares in August.
English: Icelandair aims to complete agreements with fifteen lenders, authorities, and Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before proceeding with a share offering.
New variant rather than a new type of virus
English: "A new virus just means that this has been an individual who came from abroad."
English: "This is not something that has been circulating domestically," says Már Kristjánsson, chief physician at the Infectious Disease Department of Landspitali, regarding the news that "a new strain of virus" has been diagnosed in the country.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two at the borders.
One who was diagnosed had participated in social activities of a sports club at the Rey Cup football tournament, but the origin of the infection is unknown and contact tracing is ongoing.
Also, an infection was detected in an individual who arrived in the country on July 15th, and two people who were in contact with him have started to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Then an infection was detected yesterday that is related to the infection that was identified the day before yesterday, and after a sequence analysis at the Icelandic Institute of Genetics, a "new type of virus that has not been detected here before" came to light.
Infection tracing is completed in connection with that infection.
Már points out that this is not a new virus being discussed, but rather the same virus that has been spreading all over the world, i.e., the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more accurate to talk about a new variant of that virus rather than a new type of virus.
English: Asked what it means and whether it could indicate that a second wave of the epidemic has begun, Már says that as it stands, it is only a single case and it could turn out that nothing more will come of it.
English: "On the other hand, if there are domestic cases that are not connected to foreign sources and have the same genetic variant as this particular deviation, it would be possible to draw that conclusion [about a second wave], but it is premature at this stage," explains Már.
The happiness in the hot pot
Is the secret to Icelanders' happiness hidden in the hot pots?
English: BBC program planners suggest in an entertaining video that sheds light on the swimming pool and hot tub culture of Iceland.
English: Icelandic bathing culture is unique worldwide, and it is claimed that nowhere in the world are there as many bathing places per inhabitant.
The natural geothermal heat is the basis for this, as well as the tradition of swimming that prevails here.
Children's swimming lessons became mandatory in 1940, but older citizens are no less diligent in using the hot water for health benefits.
Swimming trips are described as an integral part of the country's general welfare.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and status.
English: Unbound to mobile phones, people communicate with each other on a personal level about home and space, or enjoy the comforting power of water: contemplating and recharging the batteries of the soul and body.
On a steep path to seek a hundred days in elections
One hundred days are left until Americans go to the polls and elect a president for four years.
Donald Trump seeks re-election but he has an uphill battle to face.
Joe Biden, the expected nominee of the Democratic Party, has a significant lead over Trump nationwide, according to opinion polls.
According to a new survey by the AP news agency, a majority of Americans believe that the nation is on the wrong path.
English: Trump's response to the global pandemic of the new coronavirus is likewise very unpopular, and in addition, more Americans than before believe that the president has poorly managed economic matters.
More specifically, only two out of every ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump's response to the pandemic and 48 percent say he has handled economic issues well.
In March, it was a proportion of 56 percent and in January, it was 67 percent.
According to the FiveThirtyEight average, Biden has 49.9 percent support nationwide, while Trump has 41.9 percent support.
Trump himself has tried to shift attention from his performance towards the pandemic to Biden, fueling so-called cultural disputes and announcing policies aimed at addressing law and order.
The Biden campaign, however, makes great efforts to keep the attention on Trump and believes there is a high chance of winning if the election ultimately revolves around how Trump has performed in office over the last four years.
English: Trump's unpopularity also seems to be affecting Republican congressmen, and progressives fear that the Democrats could even gain a majority in the US Senate, which has so far seemed very unlikely.
English: Politico reported recently that the support for parties and candidates remains comparable, and now the Republican Party is facing its biggest turmoil in decades.
In the 2016 parliamentary elections, the suburban areas proved particularly bad for the party, and now it seems that this trend will continue.
English: In recent days, Trump has tried to scare residents of the suburbs into supporting him, among other things by saying that if Biden becomes president, he will destroy the suburbs of the United States and fuel racial tensions.
Among other things, Trump has repealed a regulation from Barack Obama's time in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in suburbs.
Then he encouraged the "housewives" of suburban America to read an article by the former Assistant Governor of New York, in which she claimed that Biden would destroy the suburbs of the United States and supported Trump in that regard.
English: "Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and the American dream."
I will preserve it, and even make it even better!" said the president.
Inhabitants of the outer regions of the United States are an increasingly growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
English: Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of votes from this group has become president.
English: Except for the year 2012 when Mitt Romney received the majority of votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
English: Opinion polls have shown that although Trump secured a narrow majority in the 2016 suburbs, his support there has decreased significantly.
Although there is a difference between the polls, Biden has recently been measured with about a fifteen percentage point lead over Trump in the projections.

Will the Olympic flame be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that only world wars have interrupted until now, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic flame would be "the light at the end of the tunnel," likely referring to the coronavirus pandemic that the world is now going through in unison.
High-achievers have an additional year to prepare themselves and authorities in Japan are shouldering the cost due to the delay.
Everyone keeps their heads up, as there is a lot on their minds.
When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan would be the venue for the Olympic Games this year, the cheers of the Japanese representatives were unmistakable.
They cried and laughed alternately, as Tokyo had sought to host the 2016 games but that time had to settle for second place to Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo city and Japan both basked in the world's attention.
The games were supposed to take place from July 24th to August 9th, but have been postponed for a year and instead will start on July 23rd, 2021 and end on August 8th.
If it is not possible to hold the games then, if the coronavirus is still too much of a threat, the games will be canceled.
English: However, no one wants to completely think that thought through to the end.
Olympic Games are no ordinary sports competition.
There is no expense spared, the show must always be spectacular and strive to surpass the last performance.
The choice of a city for the Olympic Games is based on the evaluation of a selection committee on the presentations of the cities.
The more magnificent the introduction — the greater the likelihood of receiving the treasure.
Tokyo spent 150 million dollars in trying to host the 2016 Olympic Games, which amounts to roughly 20 billion krona.
In the last instance, when the games of 2020 were sought, 75 million dollars, about ten billion krona, were put into the promotion.
English: In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would get the games that year, Japanese authorities had already allocated about 30 billion krona for the project.
English: But that amount is just a drop in the ocean compared to the cost of building an Olympic Village, stadiums, and generally strengthening the country's infrastructure to handle such an event, prepare for it, and host the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be taking place these days but have been postponed for a year due to the coronavirus, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.
In a report from the state auditor in Japan, released at the end of last year, it was revealed that the cost was almost twice as much as that figure.
English: It is likely that the full cost of postponing the games cannot be accurately assessed, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the original cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore range from 15 to 30 billion dollars.
There are such high figures that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic state would only suffice for just under half of the Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible cost.
Olympic Games are an event of such magnitude that they have often become a subject of discussion among economists, who try to delve into the numbers and examine the benefits and advantages of the games.
In the shortest terms, quite a few people seem to have come to the conclusion that the effects of the Olympic Games are less than positive for the economy of the cities that host them.
Short-term effects are present, for example, the number of jobs increases significantly for a short time, but in the long run, cities often end up with debt and a high operating cost of underutilized infrastructure.
Rio in Brazil is saddled with significant debt due to the 2016 Games and has had trouble affording maintenance on all the large sports facilities that were built for the Games.
English: A review of the figures after the London 2012 Games has revealed that only 10 percent of those who obtained employment related to the Olympics in the city were unemployed beforehand.
That means that there was not much discussion about new jobs except to a small extent.
In general, cities have not fared particularly well financially from hosting the Olympic Games due to the staggering costs associated with the construction of the facilities built for the games.
The benefit is often considered to lie in the increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the games, although there is great uncertainty regarding the 2021 games.
Also, it is uncertain whether it will be possible to accommodate the large number of spectators who usually attend the games.
The main issue, however, is the honor that the cities receive from being chosen, but it is difficult to assess its financial value.
English: Because despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the games bring is not of such a nature that it can be assigned a price tag.
But even though the exhibition is often magnificent and no expense is spared, this is, of course, not just about money.
English: It's the sports heroes who are in the forefront.
For some accomplished people, it is unexpectedly just welcomed to postpone the games.
English: The Australian pentathlete and gold medalist in her event at the last Olympics, Chloe Esposito, for example, is recovering well and would have been far from competing this summer, but increases hope that she will be in competitive shape for the 2021 games.
She is therefore among those athletes who are rather pleased with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
English: For those athletes who planned to retire after the games this year, if they had been held at the right time, the postponement of the games in some cases means that they will end their competition before the games take place.
Simply do not trust their body enough to go through years of additional intense training.
English: Few athletes made as strong an impression in the hearts of the spectators at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games as gymnastics star Simone Biles.
She came home with four golds around her neck and one bronze.
English: Biles has recently attended several interviews in her home country of the United States to discuss the Olympic Games.
She plans to go to the games in 2021, but she is not necessarily certain that she will still be at the top of the games next year, since she will then be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is on the higher side for a gymnast in the front row.
English: "This is a sensitive issue," says Biles, but smiles in a conversation that was published on the Instagram page of the Olympic Committee when asked whether she plans to go as far in the 2021 games as she did in Rio 2016.
"I simply don't know if I'll still be at the top after a whole additional year of training," says Biles.
She has previously talked about her body not being able to handle the stress associated with intense physical training much longer.
English: Nevertheless, she trains diligently for the 2021 Olympic Games.
English: Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to suddenly have to stop training when the pandemic was at its peak and the gymnasium was closed.
No exceptions were made for Biles compared to others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold could not buy her any extra access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like everyone else.
The basic shape is certainly a bit better than for most people.
English: "We have a strict schedule now."
It was difficult to start practicing again after the gymnastics hall reopened.
We started slowly but are now in full swing with the new and I will increase the exercises gradually and densely as the year progresses.
Of course, we don't know exactly how these games will turn out or if they will be held, but we still practice assuming that they will be, we can't do otherwise.
I have put too much on myself to abandon the sport now," says Biles.
With her, like many others, there is doubt or perhaps rather an awareness that the situation may arise where the games will not be held at all in 2021 either.
Predicting that is, however, hopeless.
English: No one can know what the situation of the global pandemic of the coronavirus will be in July 2021 and there is nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympic Games, assuming they will be held that year.
Perhaps the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
Postponed wedding due to pandemic
English: Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are more important things to think about right now," said the actress in an interview with People.
"We definitely want to get married at some point and have the dream wedding with all the people dear to us present."
English: But we decided to postpone it and focus on what is important right now, and that is to assist in spreading information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I pay more attention to world affairs than weddings these days.
There is a lot going on and we should direct our attention to what is happening in the world.
