The item cost under 20 Euros.
English: The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods.
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer and therefore it is no problem for me.
I just need a number or instruction on what I should include with the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I need to cancel the order and reorder for the better price, or is there another way to receive a credit?
I also fundamentally believe that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for older siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Just have a quick look, give a little help, bring the bottle, etc.
This is how they learn responsibility, help out in the family, and are included.
As long as they can still be enough of a child themselves, I see no problem there.
If your K1 keeps themselves busy for a short time and it's OK for them, then that's good.
You can best determine for yourself whether that suits your children.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 and accompany them for hours while falling asleep.
From a purely legal standpoint, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that is also where the statement of the psychologist comes from.
Because if something should actually happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would indeed be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether that's a risk you want to take is, of course, up to your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
English: I remember reading a crime/thriller novel a few years ago, and although I can still remember almost the entire plot, I just can't recall the title. Maybe someone here knows it...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by pouring food over himself and going into the enclosure with his predatory cats.
The case is taken over by a female commissioner who, after a brief investigation, ends up with his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There is an increase in suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before each suicide to go to the location of the suicide and document it, and to post the photos on the internet.
In any case, it ultimately turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain, and the patients ultimately confront their fear in the most extreme way.
English: (a woman jumps out of the window, another deliberately drives herself to death)
This facing the fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
At the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That is roughly the plot, and I'm pretty sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone is familiar with this plot or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh dear, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi available.
English: Must contact my husband first.
English: But that might take a while.
What steps do I need to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years, splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has a wood splinter under the thumbnail (outer side) along the entire length.

Very difficult to grasp.
English: Did not work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try it.
No chance anymore.
Tomorrow we are going to the doctor.

Due to Omicron: Johnson wants to accelerate booster vaccination
Increasing new Omicron cases worry politics and science in the United Kingdom.
By New Year's, all qualifying adults in England should receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson aims to make even faster progress in the COVID-19 booster vaccinations due to rapidly rising Omicron cases than previously targeted.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow countrymen.
So far, the target date has been set for the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
In light of the Omicron variant, we are facing an emergency, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Get boosted now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 additional Omikron cases were registered in the United Kingdom, bringing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a substantial 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I have sent out an application.
Today the invitation to a conversation arrived by email.
English: I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him/her and depending on where he/she has a cultural background from, it can either be a man or a woman.
I have no idea how I should write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and I just don't want to step on any official's toes.
Conclusion: Everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
English: 4 of them go.
Only the one that I bought today does not work
Obviously, the chair had a not apparent defect at the time of sale.
How else can such upholstery damage occur after 9 months?
First attempted on the #PRS_ORG#.
English: But that has been working for about.
English: No longer than 14 days.
Therefore, I have always purchased the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again, and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and charge me for it.
The feeling when I cannot help.
Content Warning: I will write here in some detail about domestic violence.
I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) frequently come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs all too often is that many victims do not allow themselves to be helped or think that we cannot help them.
I am fully aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are few things in my profession that affect me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a one-on-one conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, is that everyone deserves to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to simply accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in every case... I know that I cannot.
However, it never becomes easier.
Please always remember, you are worth living without violence, this is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: How good is the series based on "League of Legends"?

Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against Merlins Crailsheim
At least you could rely on youngster Johannes Patrick.
Again, nothing: For the second time in less than three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick, referring to the cup defeat in early October against Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, said, "We still have some anger in our stomachs."
The situation did not calm down after the game, but rather intensified even more with the 61:72 (28:38) loss in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Whereas more than the bare result, the manner of the performance was disappointing.
Representatively, a statistic should be mentioned that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-pointer rate was only 13 percent, with 4 successful attempts (all by the young Johannes Patrick) out of an astonishing 31 tries - any questions?
The answer was provided by John Patrick: "After the victory in Tenerife, we simply weren't focused enough and didn't implement what we had practiced."
Namely, to move the ball.
Sebastian Gleim, his counterpart, reacted quite differently: "A great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like being in front of 10,000 people."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game for his team.
"The best playmaker I have ever trained," Gleim praised.
English: While in Patrick's team, even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total debacle and came within eight points, after they had already been behind 39:59.
Besides Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time for hesitation.
Already on Wednesday (7 pm) the Giants will host the Skyliners Frankfurt, with a maximum of 750 spectators also in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I already registered a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have sought legal advice again and have therefore contacted you again.
We originally contacted you half a year ago.
Always well-groomed: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to excite his audience with reinterpretations of popular hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe had wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
English: But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been rescheduled to May 2022 - "on official order" to contain the Corona virus.
Other scheduled appearances during the Advent season by the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de) must also be cancelled for now, as stated on their website.
From January, the artists plan to make up for their dates that were already postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962, in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has enjoyed singing a lot since his teenage years.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986, he founded the Palast Orchester with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has received numerous awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place on the charts.
He has made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with his blonde hair neatly combed back and focused on etiquette, Max Raabe has become an indispensable part of the contemporary German-speaking music scene.
With the program "Good day, dear luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it possible to get a small sample piece of the furniture wood in advance?

Federal Minister of Building Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create any new housing
The new Federal Minister of Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as has been demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment; it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to provide tenants with the security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives, or housing associations is, by the way, the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party want to establish an expert commission to determine how to deal with the result of the referendum.
If the situation does not ease, however, Geywitz did not rule out discussions with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent control until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets, and an expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market still does not ease, "we will discuss further steps with the coalition partners," emphasized the SPD politician.

At least 100 dead due to tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have swept across the USA.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths to mourn.
The images from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
English: In the night from Friday to Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the USA and potentially claimed up to one hundred fatalities.
The storms leave a trail of destruction about 320 kilometers long, primarily in the state of Kentucky.
The governor, Andy Beshear, said after visiting the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had passed through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, with the official numbers increasing hourly.
Hello, I just saw that display case #NAME# is sold out.
That is very unfortunate.

Or has it been completely removed from the assortment?
Is there the possibility to order this display case in another country?

If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, the one that is in the shopping cart?
I submitted a return via the contact form and I wanted to ask if it has been received or is being processed, since I have not received any confirmation yet.
English: Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees cash incentives for getting vaccinated.
With this, they are in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, who demanded financial incentives for vaccination today.
Also, the redesign of advertising slogans into vaccination appeals - following the German model - is intended to increase the willingness for Corona vaccinations.
He switched to a company that he has badmouthed.
That does not make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and see and drink tea.
It has been a year.
He obviously hasn't sewn himself back to his old position and has looked for something else.
You are allowed to do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please process the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.

Assistance with first own campaign
English: Greetings from Boron!
I am currently running the adventure "Over the Griffon Pass" for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly guide my heroes into a campaign specifically written for the players.
English: We play The Dark Eye 5.
The big arc is created, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out, and now I am in the process of writing the introductory adventure and already stumble over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a cartload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
There, the further action is supposed to develop.
A few miles away from the village, a group of goblins is said to ambush and lure the heroes into a trap.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, trading, threatening, detecting the danger early, or whatever else the players come up with.
Group strength: 8 ordinary Goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
In case of not being noticed, the goblins lie in wait for the heroes in a sunken lane and flank the carriage with three on each side, armed with bows, while two with spears stop the carriage.
Should it come to a battle and the heroes are defeated, I have two possible solutions.
1. The heroes all become unconscious and are subsequently found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf.
English: Of course, the cart is gone.
2. Should a defeat be inevitable, this half-elf, along with two of his servants, will intervene and come to the heroes' aid in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
English: How appropriate do you consider Deus Ex Machina for Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The group of Goblins will play a decisive role later on, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now have more confidence in my narrative again.
English: I took apart the lamp again.
And put back together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I would still like to return them.
Can you then send the return labels, so I can pack the lamp and bring it to the #PRS_ORG#?

I am annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season the quality on the German Sky has steadily decreased, so with this post I want to vent a little bit.
First of all, today the broadcast was interrupted right in the middle of the F2 race in order to start the F1 pre-event coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and the launch accident had caused the schedule to be far behind the plan, they could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, the situation is such that for legal reasons F1 takes precedence and therefore everything else has to be limited, so Sky DE probably had no choice in this matter.
English: Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has broadcast the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes handled the difficult situation around the severe accident well.
Then, there was once again a lack of knowledge of the rules in F1 among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that it is allowed to change tires under a red flag.
English: Although this situation already occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, it was only when there were corresponding radio messages on this topic to Hamilton that both came to the decision that Verstappen was allowed to change tires.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that this opportunity exists for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that one should simply know such elementary rules when commenting on F1 at a pay-TV broadcaster.
It is also not the first guessing game about what is now possible or prescribed according to rules; both have constant uncertainties regarding the topic of rules.
In general, I do not like the contrived comment style of Roos, but I admit that it is a matter of taste.
But seriously, I even like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant sillinesses that make both of them seem simply unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest to the comment, as he apparently does not take it seriously.
Last but not least, advertising simply gets out of hand on Sky; during the final lap, Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into commercials, as can be heard on F1TV, where only the German audio track has to do without commentary immediately after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two channels have less advertising during training sessions than Sky, and that as free-to-air channels.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very sparse and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, except for the commercials.
At least, the magnificent F1 season is much less enjoyable than it would be with a sensible broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On this one: #PRS_ORG# Pendant Light, Brass and Multicolored Glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and still hasn't been delivered.
English: I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent out on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them already showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
Fan pumps are excellent for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium.
Also, it is possible to operate a filter system using air lifts.
English: This series is offered by us in 3 different versions.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect multiple air stones.
The MK-series has one, two, or four outputs, depending on the model of the fan pump, but it can also be used to create an accent in the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that transforms the air bubbles into a feature.
English: Here one could mention a treasure chest, shell, or something similar.
The MK series features a special, sound-insulated construction, ensuring low operating noise levels.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to a diffuser or similar via a 4/6 mm air hose...and then it's ready to start.
The fan pump should be level with or higher than the water level and should be mounted externally.
English: If the fan pump sits lower than the water level, one should insert a check valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and insert the valve in between.
This would prevent, if water were to flow backwards once, the water from running through the pump from the basin...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, like other air pumps, it should be covered and protected from moisture.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, packages are packed and picked up daily.
If everything goes smoothly on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to take some precautions, so that no one gets upset just because it took a bit longer once.
It would be like this, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the freight forwarding industry...of course, Corona does not stop here either.
Please do not rate poorly immediately just because the delivery is delayed, as this is solely due to the parcel services.
People naturally like to complain about these services, even though we would say at the moment...they have it damn hard.
This is also very different regionally.
Do not be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
English: Can you also order the legs in light color here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut's daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first US-American in space, a TV presenter, and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a brilliantly blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly minted astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961 and after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor of the company. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
English: Blue Origin did not disclose how much each of them paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminisced about her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard during his assignments and do everything himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Also, Michael Strahan expressed his enthusiasm.
He would most like to return to space immediately, said the host.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in altitude
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely automated.
The capsule, which separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the Earth, experiencing temporary weightlessness, before the reusable object landed again, slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth as the border to space, however, there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned space excursion by Blue Origin: During the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
On the second of October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the Deputy Chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
By simply pressing a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should continuously shine in one color or cycle through its entire color repertoire.
Set to color change, the luminous stone maintains a light color for about a minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative shade.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" light proves itself year-round outdoors.
In a snowy environment, their light looks especially good - only a reduced illumination duration can be expected as soon as the days get shorter.
In winter, please just make sure that no snow impairs the functioning of the solar module.
"Smart Stone" uses a common NiMH battery in the Mignon ("AA") format, which can be easily replaced if needed.
You can obtain a suitable replacement battery through our webshop, allowing you to extend the usage time of your decorative light even further.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and find the subject quite interesting overall, and I don't mind being in the lab (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical course).
Of course, I had already informed myself about job prospects before starting my studies. At that time, however, I also thought that I would definitely want to study up to the doctorate level.
English: At the moment, however, I am having doubts, especially the career prospects are weighing heavily on me.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc.), you keep hearing about great job opportunities and the profession being in high demand, but on the other hand, you also hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly low-paid positions.
English: Therefore, I would really be interested in:
English: 1) What are you currently working as?
English: 2) Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
English: 3) What did you study/ What kind of training did you do?
English: Would you do it all again?
Thank you very much for your answers!
I am currently really unsure and am considering possibly quitting my studies in 2022 and starting an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences, feel free to write them down as well :)
Extra Stress before Holidays & Holiday-Weekends
English: This topic came up last week for me.
I had to use my long weekend now to relax from it.
That's why only now a post about it.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, is there a lot of stress in our company.
As it seems, it is also available before public holidays and bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, the vast majority of people and businesses take a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day weekend coming up.
English: So what happened last week?
Everywhere stress.
Numerous emails that absolutely had to be sent out before Ascension Day, order here, order there, all *definitely* before the long weekend.
Because... yes, because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that must not be allowed?
Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also extremely annoyed.
What is the purpose of this self-flagellation because of holidays?
Why do we even have holidays if we can't properly treat ourselves?!
The stress, mind you, did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent in that regard.
My question is simply this: Is it just us, the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed-Protestant way?
Or do you know that in the north as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she hasn't bought any gifts yet.
"The nice thing is, even if there shouldn't be any snow in Erfurt, you can just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the festive spirit by baking cookies and crafting with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
Up until the reflective days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I don't have any gifts yet, I have to get started now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of molting and the renewal of plumage.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg of biotin per kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage occurring in bird keeping can be attributed exclusively to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-rich substance, the formation of a flawless feather dress requires a particularly rich and balanced protein diet for the bird.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large part of animal losses that occur during molting are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed materials is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
English: During the use of NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin supplement should be given.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you very much, I found it.
Unfortunately, it still does not work
DDR Handicraft Model Old Building E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was in operation in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway enthusiast ME issue 11/1968, used with play traces and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working condition.
In 1924, the German Reichsbahn Society commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that should be able to transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a travel speed of 45 km/h on this route.
English: A maximum speed of 65 km/h was required.
English: Consequently, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive, AEG being responsible for the delivery of the mechanical part and Siemens-Schuckertwerke for the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
All survived the Second World War and found themselves afterwards on the territory of the later GDR (German Democratic Republic).
In 1946, the locomotives ended up in the Soviet Union as reparations goods.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
In the Dessau railway repair workshop, it was determined that all six locomotives were worth refurbishing.
English: [4] As the progressive electrification of the Central German network resulted in an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare part donors.
English: In this process, the more widely available E 04, E 44, and E 94 were prioritized and built first.
English: Only when it became apparent that the processing number could no longer be increased for the E 94, the E 95 moved into focus for processing.
Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They arrived at the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in a separate circulation plan in front of coal trains from Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig, and Erfurt.
English: With increasing age, the complicated control system of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
Thus, it often happened that shooters got stuck during switching operations.
Then, the assistant who was constantly traveling on this locomotive had to use a hammer and wooden wedge to release the contactors while the train was in motion.
Damages to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to month-long failures of the locomotive.
English: [5] Since there were enough new locomotives available by the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operations was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most special subclasses, so the E 95 was taken out of service.
In addition, they faced the issue that the German Reichsbahn wanted to staff electric locomotives with only one person, which would have caused problems in train operations due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
English: [5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were decommissioned in mid-1969, the last one to follow them was the E 95 01, which retired from service on October 5, 1970.
The intended new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
English: Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a points heating system at the Halle main train station.
It took some time before the officials at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external refurbishment of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle exhibition in RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive took place.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is taken care of as a museum exhibit.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditional Association Bw Halle P have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum Railway Depot in Arnstadt with a new interior and exterior paint job. During this time, the transformers were checked, and five driving motors are operational.
The locomotives were in service until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching secondary lines, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the Central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia.
Handcrafted model H0 in original packaging, functions well, some visual refinements on the locomotive are necessary to be done by yourself, dusty, with signs of play, basement smell!!!, very rare handcrafted model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
English: The packaging may show labels and signs of storage wear.
Yes, it is the F-parts.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The center beam is supported by two feet. Unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I cannot assemble the bed.
The middle beam is supported by two feet, unfortunately, these have been produced with flaws.
The center beam does not fit into the intended bracket.
So I will receive new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent off?
English: No, no flats.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the correct ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they serve their purpose
With me, they are not flat
Could I have this sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, would you like me to explain the problem to you again?
Residential house fire with two slightly injured and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire at a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-figure euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
English: According to the information, two residents were taken to the hospital on Sunday with minor smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but police did not suspect intentional arson.
The Criminal Investigation Department of Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
That arrives much later though
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To debunk fake news - BioNTech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
English: Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not previously spoken publicly about his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend prompted him to do so, Şahin announced.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
In social media, there were false information that I allegedly was not vaccinated.
Indeed, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the network "LinkedIn".
For several months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself getting vaccinated in order to counteract these false rumors.
So far, he has refused because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I found out that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe case of Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family are not vaccinated, Şahin continued to write.
He did not ask for the reasons.
The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust.
Fear can be difficult to combat with facts; sometimes it is better to share personal experiences instead.
In the internet, an interview is circulating with Deutsche Welle, in which Uğur Şahin says that he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself also clarified.
"Legally, I am currently not allowed to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization in Germany for the administration of the vaccine.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and according to his own statements, the Biontech CEO has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without power
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had paralyzed a transformer station.
English: After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to manage without electricity for around 24 hours.
Due to the fire, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities on Friday evening.
The utility company Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers, both male and female, from the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The utility provider thanked the affected individuals for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW (Technical Relief Agency) for their untiring efforts," said the head of primary technology, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damages will take a few more days, as the Westnetz technicians were initially only able to put some lines back into operation provisionally, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to company information.
Electricity flows again
The fire that broke out on Friday around 7:15 pm has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation, according to information from Westnetz.
There, elaborate cleaning and repair work is necessary.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been established.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
English: Since Saturday 6 PM, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had power again.
English: An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9:30 p.m. onwards.
Since 11:15 pm, even those who were last affected by the outage have had electricity.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed.
The authorities had called for neighborhood assistance on Saturday afternoon after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings.
"What is important now is that citizens take care of older or single people in their neighborhood, and inform local fire stations when help is needed," explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
During the installation and operation of emergency generators, the focus was primarily on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care facilities were set up in schools for those people who were unable to take care of themselves or who needed electricity-dependent medical devices or relied on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy those from you and pay in Euros?
It is about the #PRS_ORG# bedspread in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
English: However, I cannot mount the subframe on the table top.
English: It is about Custom #NAME#.
English: There are 3 versions of it.
We wanted those with table top diameters of #NUMBER#
We have received 155cm in diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however, I cannot slide them together and therefore shorten them.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send it back, as it is not suitable for the purpose otherwise.
I would appreciate a response
Yes, that is really easier!
Then let's do it that way!
Can you send me the return label by email?
The repair is now completed.
This is something I had already tried before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
English: We do not agree with that
Nordic Combined: Riiber wins in combined event
The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepää.
Once again, the duo had to admit defeat to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country ski race with a significant lead after the ski jumping competition.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both have done it new and are using version 4.5...
It could be that they have already heard about problems more often
Have bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on there as well.
As soon as I try to open it, the message appears, oops!
English: This document could not be opened.
The file may be faulty, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone, and now what?
I have to work in between as well!
In order for the paint application to be even and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry off.
Before using the brush with a new color on the model for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do that on the later invisible inner side of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Pull the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Slight overlapping of the color layers ensures a uniform surface later on.
Avoid quickly swiping back and forth with the brush.
English: As a result, surfaces appear unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones might otherwise show through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors are applied at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, there may be unsightly metal streaks if they mix with regular colors.
Let the painted parts dry for one day before you assemble them.
Authentic appearance is achieved by the models through the decals or transfers.
From national emblems on airplanes to ship names to decorative trim and license plates on car models: The decals provide the finishing touch to the model.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easily accessible.
A cockpit can be more easily covered or stickered before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks, when applying adhesive is time, patience, and a steady hand.
Cut out each required decal individually and arrange them for yourself.
Decals are also called water slide images because you moisten their backside briefly with water until the carrier paper becomes dark due to the wetness.
English: Then you just slide the image a little bit off the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper sideways.
Attention: Always check first if the image is positioned correctly before you completely slide it off the paper, so that it does not stick to your finger, wrinkle, or even tear.
Absorb excess water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only briefly open a book, as soon as I look at something else, I can no longer read the book and have to log out and log back in, reload the book and search for the spot up to where I have read.
English: On Saturday, I have already communicated with you once before.
Can I get this via email?
English: Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived at my place in 3 separate packages
Ok, thank you very much anyway!
Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
Do I get that back without any problems?
Fertility treatment for private health insurance / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We were in fertility treatment for some time, but now, when it comes to settling the bill with the private health insurance, they are suddenly being difficult.
English: One after another:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the private health insurance and received approval for 3 attempts.
The experiments were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed with the private health insurance (PKV).
Some time later, we tried to have a second child and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet settle these with the private health insurance.
We applied again for the cost coverage from the private health insurance and were granted 3 more attempts once again.
After a few more attempts (we conducted more attempts than agreed upon, logically billing the most expensive ones with the private health insurance) we submitted the invoices to the private health insurance and received an unpleasant surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the private health insurance only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second desire for a child is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, "The insurance case begins with the medical treatment and ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
English: The questions for the experts in the round here:
English: * Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or us (5 attempts should be refunded)?
Should the private health insurance have pointed out in the commitments that with a birth, the further attempts would be forfeited?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Many thanks in advance for your help!
Can you please send me the three versions by email and tell me how to best reach them again?
Okay.
We will not order anything from them anymore.
If you add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you have obviously lost a good customer.
You are welcome to forward this to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday my colleague told me that the refund was initiated, and now you are telling me that I have to return the item first.
I can't help it if the dresser arrives completely damaged at my place
Please take a look at the screenshot to see what the colleague has written.
There it clearly states that the repayment has been initiated and I still have not received any repayment via #PRS_ORG#.
You can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not do that anymore now.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
A office chair must withstand normal usage.
Otherwise, they may not sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of this, a 24-month warranty applies.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain a different type of packaging.
I will dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transportation company in this way.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools available for purchase, but unfortunately, we cannot find them at your location.
Can you help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What exactly constitutes a low-budget film, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
English: Wikipedia has the following to say about it:
A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
In the web, you can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What attracts you to it?
And what do you maybe not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, and have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to inquire about the best price for the Odelle gray leather sofa.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now also reliable?
Thank you very much
With kind regards
Is there no phone number? A chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I will give up again soon because it simply doesn't work here.
Hello
Partial victory against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can claim a "partial victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
The costs, however, are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Protestant News Service (epd).
Sustainably, the EU has not resolved the confrontation, stated the researcher from the Berlin Science and Politics Foundation (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus doesn't quite give in, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while longer.
The treatment of people at the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, judged Bossong.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not decisively oppose it, this comes at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development simultaneously weakens the cohesion within the Union.
Apparently, she cannot assert herself when a member state decides to do its own thing, as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to its border.
In addition, the EU pays another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
English: Renewed attempt at border crossing
According to Poland's border protection, migrants have once again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on the night of Sunday and returned to the border, said a spokeswoman for the authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials were allegedly pelted with stones by migrants during the incident near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated medically by a military doctor.
English: Overall, the border patrol registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, as the ruler in Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly closed off sections of the border, according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on airlines, said Bossong.
"There, the EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard-hitting tactics and extraterritorial sanctions."
English: Minsk must also take into account domestic political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly smuggles thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
Max Verstappen is believed to have committed two rule breaches during the race, according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last Safety-Car phase when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second appeal was lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the final lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, during which the Dutchman had overtaken the car in front of him.
I'll check that.
I will speak with the bank and get back in touch with you
Thank you for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg fan day
The Europa-Park, namesake for the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sports Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
As the park announces, members and season ticket holders of the sports club from Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit Europa-Park for free on this day.
Additionally, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains shone red and white that day due to the jerseys.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, there has been a cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the amusement park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg.
At the first SC Freiburg fan day at Europa-Park, it once again became clear how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not originally 1699€ as before?
Stages in the career of the new World Champion Verstappen
The Dutchman Max Verstappen is the new Formula 1 World Champion.
Max Verstappen has done it.
The Dutchman claims his first World Championship title in the Red Bull in his seventh year in Formula 1.
His path to the summit of the premier class:
Abu Dhabi - 2012, Italy: Verstappen loses the Kart World Championship after a crash in Sarno.
Father Jos Verstappen leaves him angrily at a gas station on the return journey.
His mother Sophie Kumpen picks up the teenager in the car following behind.
2014, England: The Red Bull junior team acquires promising young talent in Verstappen.

Back then, I already had a huge hassle with them when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# dresser.
English: Judith Hermann read from her novel "At Home"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord," author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday at the sold-out Blue Note and also served as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast, and listens sensitively to the nightly sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form yesterday for the return of an item, but have not received any email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your crazy chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you should fix and not all from our household.
English: Contact Mrs. [NAME].
I cannot chat with them every day
English: We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand, and a return label.
English: This email has not arrived yet.
I would like to bring the package to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me

English: Sorry, but just because he says he is not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
English: That's like when someone from AfD says they have nothing against foreigners.
Both of them will not admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces various anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just completely let it go.
Yes, wow, then you are as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Whoever seriously questions the fundamentals of evolution is simply completely lost.
English: For my sake, a god has set the whole thing in motion.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just spouting nonsense.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously, just like Kollegah.
To achieve an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be brought as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass virtually distortion-free and without color errors up to the edge zone.
Often, magnifying glasses are labeled with magnification specifications.
These specifications only apply to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to make optimal use of your magnifying glass, we kindly ask you to pay attention to the information in the "Technical Specifications" table (see user manual in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices - including folding magnifiers - light reflections occur.
English: With an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
When adhering to the optimal usage conditions - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instruction manual (available in German and English).

Fir tree sale in Schönwolde: In the Krembz community, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced quite a few curious situations during the sale of fir trees.
Once, a man even drove home without his partner because they both could not agree.
Every year, he plants about 2000 pieces for that.
In the process, the 56-year-old has already experienced quite a few curious situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas season a bit fun, he says.
And what about the voucher??
Otherwise, I'll be gone as a customer?!
At least I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions here about which dish is better, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have their names for this reason.
In English, an equivalent might be something like the "Twister," which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
English: Issues with Fiber Optic + Devolo DLan/Magic
English: We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I am now having problems establishing a stable Wifi network.
Before, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit flawlessly except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590, and this speed also reaches the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox.
English: However, at the other Dlan module, which emits the Wifi, the full 500 no longer arrive, but the farther I move away from the module in the house, the less arrives (so I use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the internet with the new fiber-optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (around 45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was indeed slightly better than the DLan, but there were also similarly large losses here.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" through the power line with fiber optics?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely laborious to install LAN cables in the house now.
I am really desperate, which is why I created an account here especially for this.
Therefore, I would be even more pleased to receive a response.
When it's time to switch the checking account
English: Whoever thought there would finally be peace with the current accounts is mistaken.
While many banks have used the fall season to employ various tricks to have their customers confirm past fee increases, the allowances for negative interest rates are also continuing to drop.
For example, Deutsche Bank was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the tax-free allowance and even quartered it for the overnight money.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the corporate division Postbank - to 50,000 euros for checking and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for instant access savings accounts.
English: Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed upon request.
And this applies not only to new contracts, but also to "newly made individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already previously lowered the limit to 50,000 Euros, which still applies, as well as at ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, popular especially among cost-conscious customers, has lowered the tax-free allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least: According to figures from the internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still an ongoing legal dispute with the consumer centers, which have even won their case against this regulation in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court.
Now there are discussions in banks about whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in case the higher authorities also declare negative interest rates as fundamentally inadmissible and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She now officially stands at the top of Hollywood.
Yet, their life resembles a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter."
For her, who made a sensation in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
To take care of her appearance, an entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers is involved.
After all, as Aniston says, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: just ONE single chip from the bag).
That their hearts fly equally to the female and male fans is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she simply has bad luck with happiness - and is still searching for great love.
And has crossed the baby wish off the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would finally become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what is going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame also bring happiness.
Undignified end to a career: Räikkönen has to give up
English: Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight contact with the barrier, Räikkönen had to park his Alfa Romeo during the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi, not even halfway through the race distance.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the motorsport's premier class.
For the farewell, his wife Minttu and their two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position, and made it to the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich achieves 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bobsled - Sport
The goal of the bobsled pilot is to reach the record of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes.
"I did the math, I would need to achieve nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who scored two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
English: First, on Saturday, he fended off the attack by Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, moving from rank three to one.
Then he changed something in the material settings and on Sunday achieved a larger lead of 0.30 seconds.
With his team of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he prevailed over the British Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also achieved his 22nd consecutive win.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who is driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth place this time after previously finishing second.
English: Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after ranking fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, then I would do it that way too," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
In women's category, Laura Nolte secured her third seasonal victory in the two-person bobsleigh on her home track.
After finishing in fourth place in the Monobob the day before, she raced to the World Cup victory on Sunday with her teammate Deborah Levi during the German triple success.
Two-woman bobsled Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen finished in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She secured not only her Olympic qualification but also her first podium finish this winter.
The Wiesbaden native Kim Kalicki finished in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me, it was super cool, first podium finish in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama is taking me along.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the beginning, but the starting times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just about pushing, but there is also a tremendous amount to do around it".
Jamanka was a bit annoyed by the not entirely flawless rides, but she said: "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I just didn't receive it and therefore couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked about it.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he had expired, which annoyed me very much.
English: Look in the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order again, as it is currently discounted :)
Why will the shipping start only on March 16th?
There was no mention of such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
English: Was taken care of by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one.
And do not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear amazing girls and young ladies and women,
I have some things that I just want to write down and maybe some others feel the same way...
I am 24, have C-PTSD, a full-time student and a dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 like my child.
My friend (together for 6 years) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday, and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him shower (because his hand is bandaged due to a burn).
He is also catching a cold and we currently see each other less (1-2 times a week) which really affects me with my needs for affection and love.
My fur baby is currently having a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there for him with a heat lamp and petting.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month right now.
Now we also have housework coming up, which we will of course divide amongst ourselves.
But cooking for myself is currently a lot of work for me...
My PTSD illness is currently well managed, I am reasonably well treated and getting by.
Not good, but I'm managing and almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet, and the day after tomorrow I have an anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week, I have an oral exam right on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more space.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing continues, right?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of vacation.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I am just so stressed right now that I need these mental anchors, because otherwise I can't handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't manage it any other way...
English: Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Truly infinitely grateful, I cannot even put it into words.
I don't know if I would have otherwise survived my kptbs.
I think, this also partly has to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I would surely find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
Today, I received my order, but unfortunately, the entire color is different, the surface is scratched, and the table leg has an imprint.
English: With the first delivery, the color was exactly like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we exchange the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The email for cancellation was sent on 12/26/#NUMBER#.
English: By the way, twice.
English: However, it was not confirmed.
English: Now for something completely different: Back in school, I noticed that many religion teachers do not believe in God and for them it is just another subject like math or geography.
For me, it was always a bit strange, perhaps because I was brought up Christian and I somehow always believed.
How do you feel about it?
English: Maybe you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional, and it makes sense to separate them.
English: There is also a curriculum and so on.
But I would find it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What leads someone to want to teach religion, if they don't believe in it?
Preserve culture or something like that?
English: Hope the question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not? Feel free to write in English, I understand that well too.
That is already very long, then I would refrain from it
Is good, thank you.
I expect a response promptly, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support, #NAME#.
Movie search help please
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24).
I believe it was a movie for teenagers.
In the movie, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern era (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely sure).
Since I cannot describe it more closely in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers in Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action emerges.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live himself, I believe.
The transition is, I believe, also the burial site of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers fight against each other.
If that means anything to you, I am grateful for any answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on their stomach since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
English: Such a child can endure much more than one might think.
Ensure that everything around is right, no cuddly toys, go in and check more often, but do not monitor every minute.
That drives you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
English: Just watch your child when they are sleeping.
English: Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it lift itself up a bit from its belly?
Or is it lying face down directly on the mattress?
From that you can deduce whether everything is in order.
We all grew up as well, and when my husband was born, for example, it was common practice to lay the kids on their stomachs for sleeping.
In addition, we are already a "regular customer" with you and have already bought a lot of items.
But why are you only offering me 20 EUR then?
Hello, I already wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and have received no response so far.
It is about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
I kindly ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is currently not usable.
To put it quite clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
English: It's just that the politics of this station have become utterly lousy by now.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then also going on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one is an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: One does not want to be "a walking advertising column".
English: What does one eat now?
A standard advertising channel that tries to sell its cheap merchandise to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
The rules naturally apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they are allowed to continue insulting people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to cash in at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How can one find all of this good?
Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I request a callback, as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.

Whether as a comforter for stomach aches or simply for cuddling - My little Warm Buddy is versatile and can be used in many ways.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel comfortable, even when they are not feeling so well.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is exclusively suitable for the following areas of application as a heat pad:
Before heating the pillow, check for an unusual smell, mold, or scorch marks and if present, dispose of it immediately.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before heating!
In the microwave, heat at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (follow the microwave manufacturer's instructions!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the warmth evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Afterwards, place the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the initial warm-ups, slight moisture formation may occur on the surface, but this disappears with repeated use.
Definitely adhere to the specified warming instructions, as longer durations or higher energy outputs can cause damage (risk of ignition and combustion!).
Before warming the pillow in the microwave, make sure that heating grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions.
After placing the warmed inner cushion back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43°C) at your elbow!
Do not use the pillow with acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish conditions, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruises and open wounds, as well as with individuals with reduced pain sensitivity.
In case of existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes, or tumor diseases as well as during pregnancy, please consult a doctor before using.
If seams have opened and loose cores are leaking out, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and keep them out of reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the child's temperature should be checked regularly during use to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the relevant authority of the country in which the user is based.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt ranks second after first half of season - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the football Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the bottom of the table.
For Ingolstadt, things are not going well even under the third coach.
Cheering in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top match, joy in Hanover for interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
English: Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and around 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power adapter.
English: I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone would also be sufficient for operation.
Error message, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start anymore despite the plugged-in power adapter.
English: Consequently, I removed the battery, but still nothing is happening.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on mains power?
English: Is there something else broken?
Many thanks for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to be brought to the room.
How can I book that?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
English: Don't know, however, how high the seat surface is.....
Often on tour and still have a lot of equipment with you?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
20 liters of capacity can easily accommodate larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stowed away using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever else you need in everyday items, thanks to practical access points, stays well organized and separable from the camera equipment in the individually configurable interior space.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design literally has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to the photo equipment in seconds.
This works in two ways: Firstly, conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with messenger bags.
In the process, there is a metal locking hook in the closure flap with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered various "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, sturdily riveted, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, simply take the top bar; if it is rather empty, take a lower one.
Flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can be reliably closed without engaging the hook.
The second feature also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other camera backpacks: In addition to the top flap, there is also a zippered opening on both sides of the backpack.
That eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to dig through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: Especially when you are not only carrying your photography equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior space (more on that below) and easily store both items separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
In addition, you can also pull the backpack from the right side to the front of the body, in order to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, for example, while everyday items remain safely in the left half of the backpack and do not get mixed in between.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with that.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even when going to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from your support.
English: #NAME# sent me an email yesterday as confirmation for the commissioning of
Contact initiated by the shipping company for the pickup of the incorrectly delivered table announced.
So far, I have not received any message.
I request immediate processing.
I am now already writing with the third support employee, and with none of them did I get any further than the promise that I would receive an email as confirmation.
It concerns the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#
Can it be estimated when the cupboard could be delivered again?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It works.
Many many thanks for the help

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
English: Order and payment were on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered.
Please call me
If you extend the voucher for me, I will place a larger order immediately, but after all, I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And the fact that the past year went differently than expected, I could not foresee and therefore could not redeem and clarify it in a timely manner.
But as a customer, I am the one who suffers the damage and I do not accept that.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and sparked the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, turning Coloma into one of the fastest-growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
English: Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer seeking wealth in the West and wanting to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers apparently have the same idea!
You must surpass your pioneer colleagues to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources, and build a tableau that increasingly "works" for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style through fine adjustments.
Coloma spans a period of three years from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players will secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
When a location has the most pioneers, it receives a block!
This disables one half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then, the players take turns performing actions, such as gaining resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunslingers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The promoter turns to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the promoter has moved five times, covering each location once and the year comes to an end.
There is a shootout in which the players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
When the players have contributed enough gunslingers and are numerically superior to the bandits, they receive rewards.
If they fail, however, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, followed by the final scoring.
The player with the most victory points wins!
With free shipping, I accept the shipping method, merchandise shipment (games wrapped in foil), up to the dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
For everything else, mostly DPD insured and with shipment tracking (games wrapped in foil, surrounded by fleece and packing paper).
If you are a collector, I can also ship the item in a box within a box for an additional charge of 2 Euros to ensure there is a 100% guarantee of no pressure marks.
English: "Why Children are not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Media Library
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I immediately watched it.
English: >Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce debate on education.
Former patients and legal guardians now raise serious allegations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the film is difficult to endure.
And I am very grateful that many people nowadays think and act differently.
As parents and other responsible persons, it must never, never, never be about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for their development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is sensible and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: States discuss lifting testing requirement for triple vaccinated individuals
The health ministers of the states plan to decide on a nationwide lifting of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated individuals at their next meeting.
"We countries need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the testing obligation can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccinated individuals is "not only medically meaningful but also provides an additional vaccination incentive," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal on this to the Health Ministers' Conference as early as next Tuesday." - afp
So I want to send the lamp back
What is the best way to proceed?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, however, I cannot see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
I can no longer process any purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer works.
English: I have updated the account information.
What could be the reason for this?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, which means sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
The most common occurrence is hearing noises/voices, less frequently seeing images, and the rarest of all is perceiving pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are surgeries that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided in order to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia pre-talk.
Certain anesthesia methods, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
English: EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine does indeed correctly describe awareness, however, by definition, u/Nitemarex had none.
English: Misread your comment.
English: But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is, besides the legal obligation, also standard in the eCommerce sector.
Please check again if you can at least take back the defective chair.
We will sell the second chair privately.
English: There, we also lose a significant amount of money.
I already sent you an email, which you have not answered.
Once again, the question.
In the order and on the invoice, it is stated that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The forwarding company is #NAME#.
English: I just called there.
I was informed that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order, as I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor for me.
Am I not being called?
I had formulated a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle dies at 97
He has made a name for himself as a theater critic and as an artistic director.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97.
There lies the new book on the table, fresh from the press: "An old man grows older."
The shattering diary of a slow farewell to the world, which theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading, the news comes that the author has passed away.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby express my gratitude for life already".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are mainly used as load carriers in the European area.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
In 2020, according to data from Statistik Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria.
The production value was around 79 million Euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not recorded
New York wins MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After the 1:1 draw in regular time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in a penalty shootout with a 4:2 victory.
In the Eastern Conference finals, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
English: I received many great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
That was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and tender like butter!
So, thanks again for that :)
Now I've acquired a taste for it and want to cook Roulades for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow, I will start making a beef broth.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
What happens now?
What is with the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English may not be as good anymore, but I can manage it
English: It concerns a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But until today, the money has not arrived with me.
English: Would you please check that.
Where to find Christmas roasts in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and the gifts.
English: You have not yet procured any poultry?
Now time is running short.
We reveal to you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube power amplifier significantly contributes to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can adjust both the desired level and the distortion content of your sounds.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the "gain" and distortion.
As mentioned earlier, with the POWER LEVEL knob, you can even quickly access a power reserve when things get extremely loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL control, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal present here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that even when using headphones or with direct recordings, you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack, allowing you to jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you do not need a separate tuning device.
English: Whoever treats themselves to an additional VFS5 footswitch can conveniently call up the sounds with their foot, switch the effect blocks on/off, and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packs, VOX takes another step into the future!
English: However, I had seen it like that with others.
English: Is there a possibility to send the lamp back then?
English: Because it hangs too low over a dining table?
So, I would like to send them back then.
Can you help me further with this?
And the chest of drawers?
Do we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs before?
If it's not possible, I would also be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
Under certain circumstances, I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 Euros for goods that I don't need is indeed a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were supposed to be part of the delivery.
English: I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hooks.
That is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time was not worth it.
English: Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations over nuclear agreement
During the negotiations on reviving the international nuclear agreement, progress is emerging according to Iranian reports.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri said on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development," because at first there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement had resumed after a break of almost one week.
English: Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France, and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
Also, a US delegation is in Vienna on site, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia had a Corona incidence rate above the 1000 mark on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day value of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had recently always shown the highest incidence nationwide, this value was at 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2,242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
On Sunday, 200 severely ill Covid-19 patients were treated in hospitals with intensive care.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health departments have been overloaded for weeks and can barely keep up with recording new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery will not take place until the beginning of March, it might be possible by then.
I have to print this out, stick it on the package, and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
Here, I don't need to click/select/fill out anything further?
Exactly that is what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to please take care of the return shipping at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is, in my opinion, an outrage.
It is time for changes
English: ###M Bundestag, greetings to you, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
English: Why is the post here?
When looking at the activity in the past few months of the Bundestag, one can notice one thing: it is non-existent.
We have fallen into a winter hibernation and have extended the summer slump for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the reason?
For the most part, this is probably due to the dissatisfaction with how some things have unfolded here and how we are generally positioned.
In recent days, it has increasingly become apparent that many people here are genuinely still interested in the MBundestag.
What we need to change
At this point, the community surrounding the MBundestag is called upon, who wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who became aware of this project in the last few days and found, simply put, a mess.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have been found who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, as this is the only way this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server where we can exchange ideas with each other and work on concrete tasks.
You can join the server through this link.
English: Goals:
How should the Bundestag function in the future?
Which existing arrangements need to be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we present ourselves externally in the future?
English: * How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I am pretty sure I have forgotten some things, but that's not bad, that's what we have the Discord for in the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to Discord, collaborate, and let's democratically decide on the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you, which is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/bulky for it and not suitable for my taste.
For this, I have already ordered another suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG#, is it available in oversized, like 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cupboard as much as possible for the pick-up - you will have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work then.
English: #PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pickup appointment.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How long would I have to get these or decide on the return?
English: How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague whom I really like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, and currently seems to eat meat very rarely as well.
I myself was also a vegetarian for several years before.
English: In response to the question whether I always wanted to be vegan and whether vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without giving it much thought.
And indeed, I thought for a long time that I would support animal welfare by being a vegetarian, but at some point I reflected and understood that ultimately, I also support animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that discontent arose on her part, as she defended vegetarianism and claimed she knew where her meat came from and that being a vegetarian reduced animal suffering.
Now I wonder, was my answer too "clumsy"?
English: How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan, you quickly get pigeonholed and conflicts arise without intentionally causing them.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception according to § 312d BGB (German Civil Code).
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be on site on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Since I cannot be on site due to a funeral, unfortunately, this cannot be changed either.
Can an alternative pick-up date be assigned to me, please?
English: Starting from 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will be continuously available again.
Lahnsteiner Weir equipped for water rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the state
English: Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, presented a grant notification amounting to 45,000 euros for the new water rescue equipment vehicle of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Brigade to Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein City Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in safety.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this," says Lahnstein's Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment vehicle is used by the Lahnstein Diving Squadron, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, they continuously expect increasing deployments: The boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle, as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of, and then the problems started.
I cannot open the book.
I have followed their recommendations, however neither synchronizing, removing, nor reinstalling the app has worked.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole situation has already cost me a lot of time and now I am hoping for help.
Okay, it is like that.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date during the ordering process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 Standard, the previously mentioned values were determined in the Fenix laboratory at 21°C±3°C, 50%-80% humidity, and with the built-in 275mAh LiPo battery.
The values may vary depending on the flashlight used, age, and environment.

The distributor should offer customer services and Fenix will support these services.
5) The free warranty does not cover damages or failures caused by:
Any defects or damages caused by improper use include, but are not limited to, operation that does not comply with the warranty or instructions in the product specification.
For example, the product specification describes that the sealed head must not be disassembled, as this can damage the flashlight and void the warranty.
Any defects or damages that can be attributed to other behaviors cannot be appropriately controlled by Fenix.
6) To make a warranty claim, please contact our warranty department with the following information: Name, type/model of the warranty item, serial number.
English: First of all, thank you for taking on this whole matter here, I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar occupation, meaning we were also weapon bearers in the executive branch, I don't want to go into more detail about it!
I always find the question about left and right very simplistically posed.
Basically, one should say that, of course, civil servants primarily come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left; this should actually be clear to everyone.
It is of course clear that people with right-wing views beyond conservative are magically attracted to uniforms and weapon carriers. It should also be clear to everyone that these people naturally have a hard time dealing with the lived reality, because alongside the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women, and homosexuals (and by that, I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine stereotype-gay, as they appear less to not at all in the executive, but rather ordinary men and women who you wouldn't notice unless they tell you). I can and must rely on these people because, in case of doubt, they will save your life or risk theirs for you.
But even these marginalized groups, as strange as it may sound at first, represent a conservative attitude in my experience. That is, they are proud of Germany and feel less embraced by exaggerated left-wing politics, even though this politics supposedly advocates for them or thinks they need to please them. Instead, they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the subject of the far-right, since the police and armed forces are naturally a cross-section of society, extreme right-wing individuals can indeed be found there. However, the idea that they can openly express their opinions or even openly forge any plans that endanger the state is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that especially police officers and soldiers, who have often been deployed abroad, start to generalize and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences.
It also happens that like-minded individuals with right-wing attitudes meet and engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, such things are effectively combated and counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so intertwined internationally, and in my opinion that is a good thing, that we absolutely cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German site.
Why should this come from England?
English: When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I already ordered in November.
However, it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available for delivery.
I previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, could you deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany, or is this basket available somewhere in Germany?
I always only find you as a partner company.
But at the top edge of the wooden part, there are two deep notches that have been filled with something yellow.
And on the mirror itself is a small scratch
English: Tidier through child?
Hello, I (w32) have been occupied with one thing for quite some time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (am self-employed, have very little free time), but for my entire life, I have been more unsuccessful than successful at keeping my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything is left lying around, and now and then it grabs me and I clean up and clean.
But actually, it is never the case that "someone could just spontaneously come for a visit."
My husband is (unfortunately) not better either, it bothers me somewhere but mostly household simply loses against work and unwillingness.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly since we enjoy cooking.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more orderly with a child?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it and this question has been bothering me for quite some time.
Because for me, I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as no visitors come and there is always fresh clothes available and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child provide greater motivation or does one remain careless?
Looking forward to your replies.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality preformed anatomical cut offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit, and allows for almost unrestricted freedom of movement.

Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I completed a training program in software development and have been working in the field for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I increasingly notice that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been considering for quite some time to start anew and study social work.
The problem: I have a self-doubting (or anxiously avoidant) personality disorder (AAPD).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and am correspondingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have often been told that I seem unapproachable (although I believe that has already improved).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don't really want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in areas such as addiction counseling or family assistance, for example.
I don't know if the actual workday is really like how I imagine it, and it's difficult to find something about it on the internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it brings me down every time there is something to criticize about my code ("screwing up even the simplest things again") and I find it difficult to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I really should know how to do this by now"/"I'm keeping him from his work with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm really slow" etc.).
The problems will probably occur in any profession, but I wanted to mention it at this point.
English: But you have already received the sofa back, haven't you?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for an appointment for pickup
English: What do you mean by returning it, please!
When I download a book to the #PRS_ORG#, I get the message that your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book.
English: Are there any problems there?
I was in chat with #PRS_ORG#, they asked me if I received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein (protein) ingested with the food is broken down by the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein components (amino acids) and, in turn, builds up its own body proteins from these, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation in the nestling and the feather regeneration in the molting bird are extremely complex processes and involve a particularly high strain on the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as it may otherwise cause disruptions in the breeding process.
Following this course-like administration of NEKTON-Bio, one should switch back to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement preparation).
The protein (protein) absorbed with the food is broken down by the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein components (amino acids) and in turn uses these to build up its own bodily protein substances, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation in the nestling and the feather regeneration in the molting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as it may otherwise cause disruptions in the breeding process.
Following this course-like administration of NEKTON-Bio, one should return to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement).
1 g NEKTON-Bio per 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food every day.
One leveled scoop (included) equals 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
In case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given initially, until the onset of new feather growth is visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until the feather regeneration is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, without direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is being sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
English: This is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a municipal employee contrary to the regulations
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
English: I have the following problem.
On our property, a walnut tree is to be cut down.
English: So, filed a request to the municipality.
A colleague writes to me that the felling of fruit trees, including the walnut, is not part of the bylaws.
In the statutes, however, the walnut tree is explicitly stated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clearly defined.
I thank you for your answers
English: We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
English: What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe that, the only question is whether I can pay in Euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?

Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to all of you!
My Christmas is unfortunately only moderately good, because my dear head is currently overthinking everything that can be overthought.
Before I go into detail here.. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the referee course as a lateral entrant.
Originally, I studied something different and also worked in a field there (to remain at least somewhat anonymous, I won't mention anything specific here).
The whole thing became too boring for me, and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point, I ended up in teaching and was sure that this is it - even though the framework conditions are significantly less flexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't matter to me.
I have now reached the third "I Google other job advertisements".
And it's only been half a year.
English: In the previous times, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after that I can always switch over.
English: But right now, I am absolutely exhausted.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted.
Now it may be vacation, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but back then my weekend was my weekend and my end of the day was my end of the day.
English: Then I had time off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally annoy me.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the ref also runs well, as far as feedback and such are concerned.
But I am completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it completely shuts down - if it isn't doing that already.
I wonder if I want to have it like this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts - or if I should go back to my old field, where I was valued, could take time off when I needed it, and although I found the work somewhat boring, I was paid appropriately and worked together in a team instead of being a lone fighter like it is most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I won't find myself in the same place in a year as I am now and be dissatisfied.
You notice that everything is somehow confusing, but maybe as outsiders, you have advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, where I am completely done and practically start crying at the slightest thought of it.
Making decisions right now while being so emotional will probably not lead to anything good.
But perhaps your perspectives can help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for the time being.
Thank you for reading and please excuse the whiny undertone from me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series by VOX has continually evolved, which, among other things, has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand-new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers boast an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits because they achieve the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier simply better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers feature a closed enclosure and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just bubble out.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and manipulate historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound the way you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound and modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, since then it has been refined several times to meet newly added sound requirements, which in 2010 again led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as a larger number and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: They expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response.
During a thorough analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the power amplifier stage mainly determines the tube character of an amplifier and, based on this finding, developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The Valve Reactor circuit, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, in each VT+ amplifier perfectly replicates the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound characteristics of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - however, it is not enough for a victory against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro dividers, it adjusts according to the needs of your photography equipment and is suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLRs.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible equipment setup could be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a hot shoe flash.
Larger DSLM cameras, such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2, still leave room for additional lenses.
In addition, you can also store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A, or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photographic items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack provides ample space for a DJI Mavic Pro, including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
English: There are no reliable data available on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still did not dare to make a prediction about when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state-owned TV channel RTVE.
Damages amounting to millions
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the outbreak, the more than 1000 degrees hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 residential buildings and other structures, as reported by RTVE.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a one-meter-thick layer of lava.
That is equivalent to almost 1,700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damages are estimated at over 900 million euros.
English: Off the coast, two new land spits with a combined size of about 50 hectares were formed by cooled lava.
Severely affected was primarily the immensely important banana cultivation for the island, on which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants directly or indirectly depend, and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and further areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País."
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is just around the corner, and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly celebration.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something enticing about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
English: All the more important it is to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-establishing "social contract of primitive peoples," can escape rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked the Christmas days with gift-giving.
English: Before, on St. Nicholas Day, gifts were exchanged in one way or another.
The background of this still popular custom today is that Saint Nicholas, as the Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the window of three women one night to save them from continuing to live a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the popular tradition in Germany emerged of filling the boots, especially those of children, with gifts.
Protestants were offended by this custom because they reject intermediaries between God and people as "veneration of saints."
For these reasons, they object to the institution.
Martin Luther transformed Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child, thus establishing a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants do not view such detailed questions so strictly anymore, only a few are still annoyed that the tradition of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martin's tradition with Martin's singing and Martin's procession, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today, one can find everything the heart desires in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to sought-after luxury watches.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources confirm a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving gifts shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian-influenced countries, however, there is a cheerful confusion about the question of who actually brings the children their gifts.
In Germany, depending on the region, either the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of Saint Nicholas to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
This includes, for example, his white, bushy beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and the preference for using the chimney to gain access to houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure in the Christmas celebration.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost has brought some fame.
Here, it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the homeland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the delivery of gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near the Royal Palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had alerted them to a man who was said to have entered a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a weapon.
The man fled in a vehicle, according to authorities, which was stopped by officers shortly thereafter.
There were shots fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene of the crime.
The police did not believe there was a terrorist background.
In the area around Kensington Palace, several embassies are located.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
English: Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative light blends harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area, or rock garden.
The light can be easily set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Glow duration max. 10 hrs.
English: - The robust plastic design can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, they are usually menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow colorfully from within.
Quite harmless, on the other hand, is "Smart Stone": The sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or colored light (in as many as six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is intentionally chosen: Like a naturally shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
His organic curves fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn, or in the rock bed.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he knows how to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparatory work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" does not require any supply lines or batteries.
Place the "Glowing Stone" in any spot that is exposed to sunlight during the day.
English: Two included ground spikes ensure a secure hold when needed.
The matte white plastic casing itself is robust and weatherproof.
English: The "Smart Stone" discreetly hides its solar module inside, along with its battery and two LEDs – one for white light, and the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
At the onset of dusk, "Smart Stone" automatically starts to glow; you can choose the color yourself: In addition to daylight white, there are six attractive light colors to choose from.
English: The turning off also ultimately occurs automatically, as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it becomes light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts anew the next day.
I have already done that several times, it does not work.
Unfortunately, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher is not credited to me, then I will no longer order out of principle.
If you change your mind, please let me know.
Otherwise, today was the last contact.

Pill issue
Hello dear ladies,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually my first post after a year on Reddit.
To my problem: About five years ago, I reluctantly started taking the pill again, mainly because I had such incredibly severe pain during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
Now I would like to stop doing that again, because due to chronic illnesses I already have to take enough medications that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
During my last break of about two years, I suddenly got pimples explosively from 0 to 100, and they were everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it really weighed on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips on how to avoid this happening again.
Perfume-free and without any fuss, my cosmetics are already, but maybe there is something that someone can recommend to me.
The gynecologist unfortunately did not take me very seriously, and the dermatologist appointment is still to come.
Many heartfelt thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had severe neurodermatitis before puberty, then a period of calm, then widespread nodular prurigo and the acne issue.
In terms of nutrition, I have also tried all sorts of things due to chronic illness and ended up with a low sugar, milk, and meat mixed diet because nothing else has worked really well.
It could also be the case that hormonally there's simply a problem, but when you have issues everywhere like me, you just don't want to search for anything else that might be wrong.
English: I had already given everything to their colleague, Semina or similar.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my concern.
I always have to work in between and answer the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.
But is it generally available in large?
since it is available in large black

In the name of the people: Laypeople make judgments together
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothes on the judges' bench.
Yet much depends on their judgment, even though they do not wear robes: Lay judges, together with professional judges, determine whether and for how long someone goes behind bars.
Two of them talk to the "Public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznach Regional Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the Regional Court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately I cannot access the customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice for order number #NUMBER# once again to the email address provided above?

We have no way to store these for so long.
We would use the table as offered by them as if it were our own
I would be happy to. I had already ordered the same chair in blue in November and received it. Therefore, because they are so beautiful, I would now like one in gray.
Does the wardrobe need to be completely dismantled for pickup and refund?
And when would the pickup be?
110-kV underground cable will be newly built in 2022
The approval for the relocation of the new high voltage cable near Tann is legally binding.
The planning approval decision by the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
English: The network operator Bayernwerk has now announced this.
The approximately seven kilometer long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning at Reut.
Good morning,
My order from January 3, 2021, with the order number #NUMBER#, has so far only arrived in parts.
The blue order number: #PRS_ORG# with the tracking number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next steps are?
Have a great start to the week!
You can forget that, I already explained that several times yesterday!
This is a glass dresser and all the sides have burst open, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to enter the apartment due to the #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the dresser cannot be picked up because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message
But why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is with all books, that's why the inquiry at #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
English: Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues and coworkers,
I have been in the internship since summer, I enjoy teaching, but I currently still have major problems planning my geography lessons in a time-efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not well-equipped technically, so in principle I can only use the blackboard, the textbook, and an overhead projector as media.
In school, I can only make black and white copies for free (which is annoying for geography).
Currently, I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently dealing with the topic of geofactors, and for me, each lesson actually stands on its own.
In principle, the methods keep repeating themselves, but on the other hand, I also don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (since I also need that time for lesson preparations and so on).
When planning, I always start from the learning objective (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can structure it (usually, I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
English: Therefore, also the worksheets.
English: Maybe a geography teacher can show me how to work with the book in a time-efficient manner.
I would be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to process the return as quickly as possible for now.
The trade fears for the Christmas business due to the 2G regulation.
In most stores, only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed.
The trade considers this unnecessary and laments declines in sales.
He also has a possible solution ready.
The 2G regulations, from the perspective of the German Retail Association (HDE), are spoiling the important Christmas business for retailers.
In businesses dealing with items not for daily needs, there are drops in sales to complain about, criticized HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of the companies have a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
English: According to the data, merchants with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It is only going well in the food retail sector and the online area.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
The shopping with a mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
"2G while shopping does not get us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deter customers and require a high level of staff deployment.
The ribbon control must be allowed nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer only needs to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the received wristband.
In addition, in retail - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered, or tested) - random sample checks should be sufficient.
Even the shopping center-focused real estate company Deutsche Euroshop spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were recently at around 75 percent of pre-Corona levels without 2G, and revenues were at approximately 90 percent.
These numbers will now certainly drop in the middle of the all-important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, attempts are being made to find and obtain approval for solutions for the centers.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors, for example, can provide their 2G proof once at a central point in the center and afterwards - equipped with a wristband similar to that in a club hotel - can enter all stores without any disturbance". dpa
English: I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a flaw on the frame, which was attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks unsightly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and sealed it.
How do I proceed now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD-LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities ensures the adjustment of color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
Besides adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
English: Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lamp generates a strong light flow with soft, high-quality light, completely flicker-free.
The emission angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively short distance, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool for working both on the film set and in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is a slot for NP-F batteries (not included in the scope of delivery)
User Memory: The memory can store up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To configure the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons until it is assigned, and you're done.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that when switching on again, the known situation is restored - very practical for studio work, for example, when the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
Working with a battery, one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality comes from the ability to operate with affordable NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
English: The DL3120 can also check whether the batteries have sufficient power before the set - a battery tester is built in - for each of the two battery compartments, a value in the two display indicators (the left battery upper indicator, the right one on the lower indicator).
Furthermore, it is, of course, possible to continuously supply power to the headlight using the included power adapter.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
English: They have a 16mm sleeve for attachment as a connection, with that you can directly mount it to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably adjusted using locking devices on both sides.
It was ensured that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and consequently designed for durability and heavy use.
English: Additionally, a tilt joint is included in the scope of delivery.
It's great that a bag is also included in the scope of delivery.
Thus, you can transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy, without any problems and securely.
Too bad, I received it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates goal-filled comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessian team, who had recently suffered two consecutive defeats, seemed to be on their way to another Bundesliga loss.
However, then SGE picked up the pace, shooting away their frustration over a mixed season start within a good hour, and triumphed furiously with a 5:2 victory. "It's madness, what the guys have accomplished today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN, and expressed a "general praise, to each individual who was involved."
English: At first, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, who are still ranked ninth and continue to fall short of their expectations.
English: Patrik Schick had put the Leverkusen team ahead with a 2:0 lead.
What happened then also impressed the SGE coach.
"As the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," continued Glasner.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result as well.
English: Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to be on the field for the first time since the fourth matchday and his recovered muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old and, looking at the result, was particularly happy for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner now wants to maintain focus on himself, and also sees himself well positioned with regard to the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now they want to "proceed step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks at this level until the turn of the year.
Next, as part of the English week, there is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach scheduled for Wednesday (6:30 pm, Sky).
Just now, I received an email that my package is being returned to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be resent to me directly or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
This would unfortunately mean for me that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs before?
Shock for Handball Women before Quarterfinals against Spain
English: Germany's handball women left the court with lowered heads and empty gazes after the humiliation against Denmark.
At the end of the World Championship group stage, the DHB team suffered a bitter defeat with a score of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were much too fearful and had too much respect for the opponent," judged national coach Henk Groener.
Against Spain, we have to show up differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second place behind the Danes (10:0).
It is a pity that we couldn't maintain the flow.
"That was a bad game from all of us, which we have to erase," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the battle for a place in the semi-finals, a significant improvement is needed against the 2019 World Cup runner-up next Tuesday in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Best German scorer in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in the attack nor in the defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded, "We must now quickly look forward."
From front to back not up to par
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par from the kick-off.
Missed throws and technical errors in offense and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully finished a quick counterattack.
However, this was not the hoped-for initial ignition.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make a scene - and when they did, they mostly failed due to the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
Thus, the game was decided early on at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke was also shown a red card shortly afterwards due to a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals, however, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB team get somewhat better into the game and at least closed the gap to five goals by halftime.
The already faint hope for a catch-up game after the change was gone after just seven minutes at a score of 9:19.
Again, the Groener proteges sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal contenders in the final round.
As a result, the German team could not muster any further improvement in performance and left the court as a clear loser.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family Traditions during the Christmas Season
Within the context of the Reddit Advent calendar, we have secured St. Nicholas Day and are taking this opportunity to focus on family traditions during the pre-Christmas season, including Advent, St. Nicholas Day, Christmas Eve, and the Christmas holidays.
How was it back then at your home?
English: How is it with your partner?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children as well?
What is the most beautiful thing for the children?
English: The boot polishing?
Baking cookies?
Tree decorating?
Is music being played?
Does Santa Claus come, the Christ Child, or is the gift actually from Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone makes an effort around Christmas to have the best possible time as a family.
Whether it's fixed traditions or even something different every year: tell us how it went or goes in your family!
Please send me any transaction number, or anything else that could help.
English: Transfer confirmation... etc
I would like to give away a voucher code.
just like with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Does that work for you?
The title suggests it, I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to be completed to a large extent, it continues partly in vaccination centers for me afterwards.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not personally related (e.g., "I am taking medicine X, is it compatible with the vaccination?").
In my area of responsibility, I am in charge of providing information about vaccinations, determining eligibility (the person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Coronavirus Vaccination Regulations and there are no reasons against it), medical documentation, and, if necessary, emergency care for allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for heaven's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who are not able to administer vaccinations themselves (are not allowed?), so in these cases, I also perform most of the vaccinations myself.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
English: What exactly is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by someone from Amberg, the Bavarian Broadcasting TV show "Wir in Bayern" has caused intense contemplation.
However, unlike on many previous days, the term in the series "Understand me?" remained unguessed by the callers this time.
English: No, it was not a "person who is nervous."
And also no one, "for whom everything must happen quickly."
That, the people heard from the TV host, is completely wrong.
English: Whereupon the man from Amberg shared the solution, which probably also caused astonishment among many Upper Palatinate residents.
"The Huidlerer", the viewers learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
With the note, this is said to be a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
With which an educational gap was closed - probably also for some who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
It always shows the following error message after confirmation: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have reset the #PRS_ORG#, restarted it, connected it with the PC, synchronized, and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
Tire choice for racing bikes - really that puncture-proof?
English: This morning I woke up full of energy because I wanted to do at least a little bit of training in preparation for my bike tour coming up next week.
Said and done, and I set off with my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what lurks in almost every city center (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) happened.
Glass shards on the track.
Zack, a loud hissing, and my rear tire absolutely did not want to continue for the rest of the route.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and spare tube due to the weekday, I had to turn around with a somewhat bad mood and take the first available train back home.
It wasn't really that bad mood-wise, maybe it's even better if I practice changing the tire again before the bike tour.
Now, however, I am faced with a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would be extremely reluctant to encounter this issue more often.
English: Now it really wasn't bad, as even the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, who had ridden 120 km by 2 pm on the day I came to pick up the bike) were also already described as suboptimal by him, because he had been riding with them for several years on a roller trainer.
When I think about having to change a tire after driving 80-90km, I believe I'd really be in a bad mood :D
Now I have started a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me in amazement why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really indestructible?
I don't really feel like spending €40/tire right now, just to be disappointed in the end.
Furthermore, I wonder: I currently have, I believe, 25x622 on my racing bike.
Although they do exist (apparently?) with the Marathon Plus tires, the majority are indeed wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me to get different tires for a racing bike?
The Swallow-Page seems to recommend the Durano DD more for my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thank you in advance for the help and warm regards!
Car skids into tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old was driving on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten when his car collided with a central island for an unclear reason and subsequently ended up on the opposite lane, as the police reported.
There, it resulted in a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was subsequently hurled against a tree and the man was trapped inside the vehicle.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

English: After the release of our new high end wideband speaker B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would welcome new additions as well.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and visually resembles the big role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, a suitably designed base is included to elevate the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound quality.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of generating such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and, for her size, extremely impressive and accurate.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight increase in treble.
This is common practice for broadband systems in order to optimize the strong bundling of excessively high frequencies.
Precisely aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with its very clear and fine sound.
Slightly rotated outwards, the treble range can be reduced, thus creating a warmer sound.
Thanks to the point sound source, the localization of individual components of a music piece within the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and astonishingly precise.
The reference-suspect extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamic that is second to none.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our construction kits, it is recommended to think about the final appearance of the speaker at the beginning in order to include the necessary adjustments during construction.
For example, if one wants to veneer the housing, the recess of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds more material.
After all the panels have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate location to be able to easily run the cable through it later.
With the help of a router, the speaker opening is now made in the front so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be installed flush later.
On the back side, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive an interruption in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase."
After that, you begin the actual assembly of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
On this, the back wall, the lid, the front, and the bottom are now glued.
In the process, the three reinforcements should also be inserted and glued.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in material thickness if required, for example, if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next work step, the second page will be attached.
After that, all the plates of the foot follow, meaning both sides, as well as the front.
By using a suitable hole saw or a Forstner drill bit, the installation of the openings for the bass reflex tube and the connection terminal on the back wall is made easier.
Subsequently, use a round router to round off all edges of the actual box.
English: The top surface of the base plate can also be rounded off with this.
Afterwards, the base plate is firmly glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
English: Next is the marking and pre-drilling (2.5-mm drill bit) of the screw attachment points for the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuuming / blowing out), you can begin laying the cable.
The easiest way to achieve this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
In this process, the entire and uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the base until it reaches the terminal opening, leaving approximately 30 cm protruding.
In the upper part of the housing, guide the cable to the speaker opening and let it hang out loosely there as well.
English: Subsequently, the crossover is prepared and put into use.
The construction plan for the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Assembly Instructions Crossover Solo 15.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box follows, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bass reflex opening and with a bit of skill, you can let hot glue drip onto the opening and seal it like that.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, one can accordingly check the sealing.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
Subsequently, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and fastened with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this case, so the positive wire (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the speaker (larger contact).
In the end, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered only at the beginning of June?
Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we are hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, due to known reasons, it is not possible for us to accommodate more than four people in the studio, which has resulted in a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people per switch involved, so we will be following the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We are doing our best to avoid delays or other issues.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - nevertheless, we will do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start at around 0:30.
Get your drinks cold, plan good food and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
