Sometimes it seems to me that through the translator, my thoughts in Czech differ from what I write in Ukrainian.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Good day, I agree to take the course.
However, please tell me, is there an earlier time?
Because I do not live in Prague, there may be difficulties with transportation.
If there are no options, then I agree anyway.
Thank you in advance.
In Kherson, people have taken to the streets again for a rally, Russians did not have time to disperse them.
As the event participants told the agency, the residents of Kherson managed to hold a rally before the Russian military with equipment arrived to disperse it.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now, equipment from the Russian Federation has arrived there," - shared one of the participants of the event.
Earlier, townspeople traditionally gathered for protest actions at Freedom Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and the regional council.
Currently, this square and the building are controlled by armed Russian troops, who use weapons against rally participants and kidnap people.
As reported, on April 3rd, armed Russian occupants used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As reported by Ukrinform, residents of Donetsk region regularly hold peaceful protest actions against the Russian aggressor.
Russian military forces are using force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
Also, Russian invaders kidnap residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded Kherson the special title of "Hero City".

If Nazar works from 5:30, he can use any train:
Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, if it stops beating, our positions will be weak
English: President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the battles for eastern Ukraine, and in particular for Mariupol, determine the course of the war - and if the Ukrainian Armed Forces suffer defeats there, the Russians may leave the negotiations and reoccupy the deoccupied territories.
Direct speech: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It beats - we fight, we get stronger.
If it stops beating - our positions will be weaker.
They (the city defenders - ed.) are people who have attracted a large number of enemies onto themselves.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the JFO (Joint Forces Operation) area, and if they are stronger, the negotiation table will be more favorable for us and we will have advantages in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our situation will be weak in all these directions, then we may not wait for the meeting.
That's because then Russia will be taking all those steps that could lead to the return even to those cities that we have deoccupied now.
They can go for it too.
Then our position in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, even not interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we acknowledge.
We believe in our result, in our victory...
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to go for negotiations after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we must not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them".
Direct speech: "People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
In our conditions, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something - and I don't think they will be satisfied with any peace under any conditions.
But if we speak without emotion, the war must end with peace, or it will end with millions of victims.
And even there, where a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight ‚Äì but for the sake of life.
You cannot fight for the sake of the saw when there is nothing left, no people.
Good day, do you still have available spots for the Czech course for adults at 19:00 on Tuesday?

In connection with the change in the esthesis of Ukrainian literature, new concepts are needed to describe its new qualitative state.
English: Specifically, the analysis of the metaphorical space in Ukrainian literature, the examination of the state
English: The study of Ukrainian poetic metaphor in contemporary literature allows for the analysis of the postmodernist context as such, where metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion.

Moreover, we go to work and raise funds
English: On Monday, we will have a leadership meeting, and we will decide how and when we will hold it.
English: Good, because I already started to worry that I misunderstood something and ended up in the wrong place.
I think this is the right decision, it's better to have fewer people and be able to provide quality assistance to them, rather than having a lot of people.

English: The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian servicemen who took part in the commission of military crimes in the city of Bucha, Kyiv region.
As reported by Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informs about this on Facebook.
English: "Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has obtained a list of servicemen from the 64th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade who are directly involved in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Bucha, according to the statement.
In the GUR MOU, it is noted that for the crimes committed against the peaceful population of Ukraine, all war criminals will stand trial and be held accountable.
You can view the list by following the link.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel, and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from the Russian invaders.
In the liberated cities and villages, mass killings of civilians by Russian military have been documented.
English: On April 1st, the city mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, reported that 280 people were buried in the fraternal graves.
English: General Prosecutor Iryna Venediktova stated that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were removed from the territory of Kyiv region liberated from Russian invaders.
English: On February 24th, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

I watched the weather forecast. It will be cold.
I don't need brandy.
Just nice clothes at reasonable prices and with available sizes.
We were at the store near the railway station
Professions that are offered. Is it possible without language knowledge?
This is important, if there is such a tradition, then I need to know so that I can prepare.
English: I thought in a week, but the situation here is heating up, sirens constantly
Tomorrow there might be poor connection on the road.
I am grateful to every person for the experience, even if it is painful.
I believe that I have gained experience from each situation in order not to repeat mistakes in the future.
Directives are made in the form of numbered written additions, which are part of this Regulation.
I am confident that there will be no problems with this.

The wife is not angry that you are on the phone.
In my daily prayers, I thank God and the Virgin Mary for you.

The location, day, and time will be specified according to interests and possibilities.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
It would be great, I have money for two months rent, in Olomouc the area does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of brutal abuse of civilians north of Kyiv.
Photographs of tortured and executed people have disturbed the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people are questioning each other, how could this happen in the 21st century?! How?!
And from my side, nothing surprised me at all. What I sadly expected is happening...
I evacuated the children and elderly parents from Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then the female colleagues with children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have been consistently helping the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and I have never doubted that in case of occupation of a suburb of Kyiv, my family would not be spared.
Because I was and remain absolutely convinced that the essence of the rotten communo-KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, he simply cannot exist, he is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was executed by firing squad in the prison of the city of Zhytomyr.
Several years ago, at the Zhytomyr Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), they allowed making a copy of the execution case of my great-grandfather: the entire case is over a hundred pages long, but the death sentence is very simple and, therefore, even more terrifying.
The accused was illiterate and denied the guilt.
Ethnic Pole, Catholic, had five children, was from free people, poor "single estate" nobility, never were serfs.
The fact that they lived in hamlets and had several cows was enough to condemn the plowman and the caretaker of young children to execution.
Relatives did not even find out about the burial place.
Grandmother said that nearly a hundred people were taken from the village at that time and all were killed except for two, who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case, there is the surname of the informant Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and would not be surprised if his relative was a KGB informant.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, as it is known...
The firing squad that condemned the peasants to execution were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of my great-grandfather, I became interested in various information resources.
There are wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia, such as "The Immortal Barrack", that qualitatively remind us of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, descendants of NKVD members found ways to punish and eradicate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers - the system first discredited, and then destroyed them.
It seems that they found files with child pornography on the computer, for which they put him in jail, and there he died quickly.
KGB agents are still killing those who try to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?!
There, the most disgusting features of human nature are concentrated.
Over the thousand-year old Horde tradition, the slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th centuries were imposed.
And then, over what came out of it, a beastly genetic experiment was conducted, cutting out intelligence during several waves of red terror.
English: Watch the half-French film "Checkist" from 1992, that's how it all happened.

English: Lyubosh, Ihor asks if it is convenient for you to go tomorrow? (He is off and can go because they haven't looked at the car at the station today yet).
We are very sorry to bother you so much.
You are helping us a lot, thank you!!
English: In Borodyanka near Kyiv, during the dismantling of rubble from two multi-storey residential buildings, the bodies of 7 civilians were discovered.

In Russian prisons, approximately 1,700 Ukrainian defenders and civilians are being held.
Among them - 500 women.
Germany will allocate 1 million euros to support the International Criminal Court, which is investigating war crimes committed by the Russian army in Ukraine.
Canada has imposed sanctions on 33 Russian defense sector companies.
English: In the past day, during battles in the east of Ukraine, one enemy tank, three armored personnel carriers, three artillery systems, 24 units of automotive equipment, one helicopter, and three drones were destroyed.

When girls return from studying, what do they do afterwards?
We arrived at the place where we were settled from the center in Pardubice, the conditions are good.
English: But there is a big "but." Men live here who drink alcohol and smoke in the room, loud music is the least that "disturbed," the smell of cigarettes, drunken men, and we are with children... It's scary to sleep, to be honest.
Please help with housing, for money please.
But where it will be safe and not smoky.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is so strong, as if they are being smoked right here.
I beg you very much, one of them can barely stand on their feet, something screams, something he doesn't like. It's very scary.
I just ask if you can helpüôèüèº

When Mrs. Shahova introduced me as an employee of Fpoint, the first question was how they found the dog, how they found the pug.
Everyone is following the page on Facebook.
They asked to send you greetings and say that they find it very interesting to read the news.
They also talked about Roma people and the privileges they have in Ukraine.
And they agreed that if a child comes and the parents do not understand Czech at all, then after work I can help them by phone.

I don't know about Europe, but in our country people get married for various reasons, mostly for selfish and mercenary purposes.
And I have a problem with this, if I don't love a person, nothing will come out of it.
Yes, we took it home and brought it to the aunt right away.
She was very, very grateful, she even cried.
I was telling her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
She said if it's possible, there might still be some old blanket and pillow.
But it's not obligatory. Only if it will be. I am also very grateful to you.

Before him, they killed my best friend.

Can the children come to Vali and play in the hall?
Alright, let's take a risk then :)
I am also glad to have met you
I was talking to Volodymyr about housing, asking whether I should wait until they find it or keep looking myself. The ladies living with us said that we need to go to the metro station called "Muzeyna," as there is an organization there that helps in finding housing.

I will write to you in any case.

As reported by "European Pravda", Welt writes about this, referring to sources in the government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the relevant proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, amounts to 1.7 billion euros.
As well as offering howitzers in the BTR Boxer version for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in battle have to get relatively close to the enemy's targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at distances of over 30 kilometers.
As reported by Ukrainian government sources with reference to KMW's proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will be carried out using a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers in the shortest possible time, and the gaps that have formed will be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after signing the contract, which means no earlier than the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed until 2027.
And are we together in the first half of the day or in the second half of the day?
Thank you, we will find out how to replenish the account and get in touch. I will write back to you. Thank you.

I will share my thoughts with you.
For me, marriage is the mystery of two people who do not discuss each other with their relatives or friends.
Man and woman decide issues in their family themselves, especially without the participation of relatives.
Can we be together?
This will take some time before we will be together.
Why not try this way for now
I rented a car for 9 people, we will come with Mariana and your family.
How much time do you have? At what time do we need to leave?
Yes, I am glad to listen to jazz
Thank you, I am working with this application, we were told about it during the Czech course on Wednesday.
Over the last four years, I haven't let anyone get close to me, read many philosophy books and have been figuring myself out.
When it hurts very much, it's hard for you to trust.
But one must try again, everyone goes through something that changes them forever, that's life.
Martine, we are already going to bed.
Thank you for such a beautiful and fun day.
We really liked everything.
We feel like we are in our own family.
Children spent the whole evening telling their father, all the grandmothers and grandfathers how nice it was at your place.
From the girls, greetings! From us, the best wishes for the holidaysüòâ
And where are we looking now
I hope that my son will come out alive from this meat grinder.
Let's go today, maybe something will be needed.
How to contact them to open the doors?
Is there any improvement in overcoming the coronavirus?
Very grateful for helping people. If you can, please help us too. Find affordable housing.
We are currently in Slapi, friends have sheltered us for a while.
My family: husband, 6-year-old daughter, 11-year-old son.
The man has already found a job as a driver.
I am a massage therapist, rehabilitation specialist looking for a job.
In order for the children to be able to attend school and for me to work, we need housing not far from civilization.
I just desperately needed to give it today!
Nothing. We'll wait until tomorrow. I didn't know that even big stores would be closed.
I prepare cabbage rolls like this: in a saucepan, I dilute tomato paste in 0.5 liters of water, using 3-4 tablespoons of tomato paste - bring this to a boil.
I place the cabbage rolls in a pot and pour this sauce over them.
Roast in the oven for approximately 1.5 hours.
How much money do I have on this number?
I have to bring all this

I really want to be with you.
Make you happy üò¢.
I don't know, my love, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I treat this as if we are together. That we are a couple.
I would say that after the war there will be a lot of work.
That's why I'm not afraid that I won't find her there.
I know how to do many things.
That's why I'm not afraid that I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know what will happen with housing. üò¢üò¢üòü
I need to undergo an inspection for obtaining a food license. Can I do this with you?
Please let me know, prepare an apartment for 5 guests tomorrow.
Fifth place, I understand, is in the room with the television?
Arrange and make the sofa bed?
Can we stay with you while Mrs. Margarita finds us accommodation?
Don't worry about it
Not new, already used, but it is working and not needed.
Write the address in Czech, let's see on the map where it is located from us.
I don't know how much free space there is, so I can't plan anything with the furniture, but I want to finally take a look at that apartment this week and then understand what kind of furniture I need.
I'm sorry for taking so long to respond, it was a busy day, and it's hard to adapt.
Is this enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I finally want to be with you, to have the opportunity to embrace you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell you how it suits you.
For the child, there is already a crib and a bathtub here, found things for the first time.

I do not want misunderstandings with you
Because I worry that everything will be fine!?
Because with these excursions, we didn't even talk about it!
I understand how important this is for you!
And about myself, I keep silent (for me, it's just a peak that is unattainable)!
How are you feeling today? üòÖ After the celebration?
Hello, sorry, I just woke up, slept poorly
Sorry for bothering you.
I was upset that Kolia and I started translating the test poorly yesterday.
I will ask if Hryhoriy Denysenko or Yonaszek can help me a little with mathematical concepts.
Maybe I can be of some use to them?
If there is such an opportunity, I want to brush up on mathematical terms during the weekend.
Geometry is generally difficult, but we have to practice with Kolya so that there are no mistakes.
Thank you for the test tasks
We really hope for it too
And she is really happy with any gift.
I would like to connect the internet to my Czech phone number
Yesterday at the bus stop of bus 402, I met a Ukrainian woman named Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is alone... her eyes are full of tears and sorrow...
I could not stay aside.
Now we have agreed that we will be friends.
And yesterday evening, I thank God for this girl, because she is the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.
The branch in hall ‚Ññ29 is specifically designated for submitting and processing requests for assistance.
It turned out that I ordered a spare card.
It's not worth it, I am just a person
So that she wouldn't be scared that nobody came
I didn't go. Yes, I baked it myself. I can do that! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So are you leaving the city for a long time?
English: Half a year ago, at the Holocaust Memorial Center "Babyn Yar" in Kyiv, we commemorated the 80th anniversary of the mass execution of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babyn Yar.
I had the honor of speaking after three heads of state, among whom was the President of Germany.
He spoke about the "common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, and a peaceful and secure Europe."
This foundation we must protect - it is also a part of our responsibility, connected with our history.
If "evil demons of the past appear today in new clothing," he said, "then for us, Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The struggle must continue.
Today, Russia attacked a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of peaceful residents, starving the inhabitants of the cities it has blockaded, and letting them die from diseases.
Russian troops are carrying out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings in Babi Yar.
For over a month, Germans have been seeing this in the news in real-time.
Yes, Germany is implementing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which not so long ago was unimaginable.
Germany delays the delivery of heavy weaponry needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to stand against the swastika.
This means to fight by all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes, and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to overcome evil and stop the atrocities happening in Ukraine.
English: I'll sing you a lullaby
We agree, arrange for the tour, and write when to be gathered.
All were sick, only Lidiya was not sick; they had Omicron, a new type of COVID.
Then I'll do it tomorrow
With this coupon, I use it instead of a card
Apologize for the delay in documents.
The ticket cost me 2000 hryvnias from the conductor
Sergiy Sydorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO, and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea, and the beginning of the war in Donbass, the number of NATO opponents began to decrease, while the number of supporters, on the contrary, started to grow.
After the start of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - over 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance NATO provides in times of war, there is currently a lot of criticism towards the Alliance and its member countries - for untimely arms deliveries, refusal to close the sky, and unwillingness to "drag" Russia.
Apart from this, there is a high risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its aspiration for NATO membership due to the position of the Russian Federation if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "Cursed Questions," together with the editor of "European Truth," we talk about how exactly the Alliance has been helping Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for, and what the Alliance is criticized for in vain, why our perspective on NATO membership is closer than ever in history, and why the security guarantees being discussed in negotiations with Russia may become the second Budapest Memorandum.
English: What do you think is here?
In my account, my partner status indicates that my application is under review.
I submitted it through this mobile app
There is no visa, we need to go to the congress center and find out how to do this, because it was processed in Poland, where they did not give visas, but they gave a PESEL (Polish id number).
We will definitely write to you!
Denys went today in a good mood.
English: Agreed with the boy from Ukraine, whom he met yesterday, to meet near the school so that he could show him everything.
So I hope everything is alright with him
Because I don't like it this way, I don't last long
In Ukraine, it is reported that the Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine.
I am going, leaving the children alone, waiting there for 3-4 hours, and then going home because I can't leave them any longer.
And take with you at 6-7 in the morning
Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had sincere feelings for this person, but he acted not very decently and I left him.
After some time, he returned and asked me for forgiveness.
I refused him.
Then, after some time, he called saying that he had undergone heart surgery.
After asking to simply chat with him, I started to feel sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
During this time, we spoke a lot.
At that time, I simultaneously began having problems at work.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual assistance.
And I started wondering, maybe it's really necessary to look at him from a different perspective.
And he proposed to me, and then he died two days later.
Therefore, God himself decided our destinies.
What does being ready for marriage mean to you?
And he speaks only in Czech
I wanted to say that I managed to find housing, and I am very happy about it ‚ò∫ now I have a place to live and be with my child.

Alright, let's talk about something else, because I'm not sleeping anyway, I'm falling asleep and I dream that they're bombing...
God is never late, everything has its time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I fully understand the value of unskilled labor and realize that the kind of job I had at home in Kyiv, I will not be able to have here, and the money I earned at home, I will not be receiving here as well.
But just sitting and doing nothing I cannot do, because then all sorts of bad thoughts enter my head, so I need to occupy myself with some physical activity.
At the airport, documents are processed from 7 in the morning until 7 in the evening, at other times you can just wait.

Please tell me, do you have at least an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments for a month ahead, even for a rough understanding of which days?
I just can't memorize this schedule)
Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kyiv: they say "we have never done this before"
Direct speech of Konashenkov: "We see attempts of sabotage and infliction of strikes by Ukrainian forces on objects in the territory of the Russian Federation.
English: If such incidents continue, the Russian Armed Forces will strike decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, which the Russian army has previously refrained from doing.
Russians launched missile strikes on Kyiv from the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation's occupation forces in Ukraine.
English: On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles, which were shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system, fell on a multi-apartment building in the capital's Pozniaky area.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a multi-story building on Valeriy Lobanovskyi Avenue.
On March 1st, Russians hit a television tower in Dorogozhychi near Babyn Yar, as a result of which 5 pedestrians were killed.
On March 2nd, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying over the Southern Railway Station towards the Ministry of Defense building.
On March 14, debris from a downed occupant's missile destroyed a house and a trolleybus in Kurenivka in Kyiv.
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential area in Vynohradar, resulting in one person killed and 19 others injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping mall in Vinogradar, as a result of which at least 4 people were killed.
Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko once again stated on April 13 that it is too early for residents of the capital who were evacuated from the city to return.
Military officials explained to the local authorities that Russians can still launch missile strikes on Kyiv, and furthermore, there are many mines and unexploded ordnance in the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that Russians are planning to carry out a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to blame Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army towards the civilian population.
English: On April 1st, near Belgorod in Russia, an oil depot exploded, allegedly due to an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
English: In early April, local authorities in Belgorod claimed that an alleged "Ukrainian projectile" had fallen near the city.
It is obvious that the elites in both Washington and Berlin are breaking into a cold sweat at the mere thought of NATO fighters shooting down Russian bombers in the sky over Ukraine.
But Zelensky is speaking not so much with them, but rather with their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands-strong crowds in the squares of Europe's largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was unavailable to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not persuade European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he persuades European nations who elect those politicians.
And these speeches, this sophisticated alloy of strength, emotion, and sometimes despair, gradually achieve their goal.
While Biden is firmly against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against accelerating Ukraine's entry, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want people to consider us as swindlers.
The funds you collect would be better given to people who are more in need.
I can come to you and we'll decide on the spot. I don't mind as long as I can help.

English: You have dreams.
You are planning to buy that dress you saw yesterday at the shopping mall.

He clings to the old reality.
English: You are calling work to find out if you should go to work today or not.
You decide to leave the children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There is hope... this won't last long.
Now ... to agree on something ... something will happen.
The brain refuses to perceive...
Where to go ?? I have no one and nowhere.
I have $50 in my pocket. We spent everything we had at home.
Many people did not receive their salary from our managers at our workplaces.
Where should I go? Who needs me? How do I support my children? Where should I live?

These are tractor drivers who actually go out into the field under fire, because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who agree today to go to temporarily occupied territories in humanitarian convoys in order to bring help there and take people from there.
These are heroic conductors who fearlessly go to the combat zone, calm and help refugees in the wagons, and at peaceful stations help volunteers load humanitarian aid into the wagons.
These are gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway during the first days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are utilities workers who, under fire, remove garbage, repair water pipes and power lines to ensure people have the necessary resources.
These are doctors and nurses who save lives 24 hours a day without complaining, and even volunteer in their spare time, collecting medical kits for the front lines.

I am looking for accommodation for me and my daughter for 3-4 days to come to the Czech Republic and submit passports for visa processing to Canada.
In Warsaw, there are a lot of people at the visa center and the online queue is not working.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's far away, the train journey takes a lot of time, and it will be difficult for the child.
That is why I decided to search for accommodation in Prague or not far from it.
No, everything suits us

Up until that time - they put such stamps and then equated these stamps to visas
Foreign Electoral District of Ukraine (FED Ukraine) ‚Äî an electoral district that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of voting premises at embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises on military bases abroad [footnote 1] where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents are present (Kosovo and the Democratic Republic of Congo).

Head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak reported that Russia is starting a "fake operation" regarding the weapons that our allies are supplying us.
Direct speech of Yermak: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and want to "knock down" weapon deliveries by any methods.
For example, one of the latest fakes - allegedly the destruction of the S-300 air defense systems transferred by Slovakia.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What will happen next? We are familiar with Russian scenarios. Name one of them.
They can spread fake news that Ukrainian soldiers are supposedly surrendering with weapons from allies, and these weapons massively transition to the armament of the Russian army.
I want to immediately warn against such fakes.
Because the weapons in the hands of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exclusively send the enemy to the next world.
Excuse me, please, I forgot to ask how much the kindergarten will cost per month and will it be operating in the summer?

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after the emergence of evidence that Russian forces committed atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine, and Moscow dismissed these reports as a "provocation."
"Reports of Ukrainians killed, raped, and severely wounded by Russian troops are worth condemning," - stated New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to journalists in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents "a violation of international law."
Statements were made after reports emerged that hundreds of civilians were shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kyiv, in Bucha, by Russian forces that had left the area after an occupation lasting several weeks.
English: Photos allegedly depicting the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied have shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
English: President of France Emmanuel Macron stated in a radio interview on April 4th that there are signs that Russian troops committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez stated that Russian forces could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," ‚Äì said Sanchez in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3rd, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as a "provocation."
She claimed without evidence that the United States and NATO "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me, the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who 'ordered' this story," said Zakharova.
Earlier, the Russian Ministry of Defense also claimed without evidence that the Bucha images are "another staged act by the Kyiv regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city before March 30th.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to convene on April 4th to discuss what it called "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
The Investigative Committee of Russia published a statement on April 4, in which it announced an "investigation" into allegations of Ukraine spreading "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on April 3, accusing Russian forces of committing "genocide" in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military has done.
English: "I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being executed," Zelensky said in a video message, switching from the Ukrainian language to Russian.
And there is shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For shots in the back of the head," he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and beheaded, I do not understand," he said about the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a town approximately 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
English: On April 2, a correspondent for the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty saw what appeared to be bodies of civilians on the streets of a small town.
Only in one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various locations in Bucha.
English: The bodies of one group of nine people - all in civilian clothes - were scattered on the ground near a location that, according to local residents, was used by Russian forces as a base.
It seems that the victims were killed at close range.
Overall, the Ukrainian authorities stated that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the Kyiv region, which was controlled by Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything according to the list.
"They were told: There is no Kyiv". How occupiers insidiously transported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, tortures.
In this list, there is another point about which there is currently much less information - the evacuation of the local population to the enemy territory.
Approximately since mid-March, Russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed president Lukashenko has effectively handed over to the Russian military training ground.
The "Ukrainian Pravda" found the transported Ukrainians and their relatives in order to inquire about how the so-called "evacuation" takes place and if there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text agreed to a voluntary-compulsory evacuation beyond the borders of Ukraine under psychological pressure and due to hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and maintaining contact with their relatives.
However, considering the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were forcibly transported to Russia and Belarus under strict coercion.
So, in Melitopol, Russians abducted the staff of the second maternity hospital, took children away from there without parents, among whom is 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian swimming champion Yosyp Zache_pinsky.
Alexander's family, Marina, and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
English: Oleksandr has just got a job at the "Antonov" airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers away from the village.
The family settled in the territory of a military town, even though they were civilians.
As true scouts, Denis and Marina had prepared emergency suitcases in advance, but they did not manage to evacuate on the morning of February 24th.
They did not have their own car, and suburban buses were no longer taking anyone.
Approximately at 12 o'clock on the 24th of February, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the arrival of the first projectiles.
One of them hit the neighboring house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17th, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In their basement, about 40 people were hiding.
Not everyone decided to go.
At 6 o'clock in the evening on February 24th, people entered the entrance who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They ask: "Is there anyone?" - I say, yes. - "Come out!".
They searched me, asked who is in the basement, and if there are any weapons.
All men were questioned whether they had served in the army.
Women were told: "We came to protect you on the order of Ramzan Kadyrov."
This was Chechen riot police, not even military, young guys around 25-35 years old.
They said, "Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sashko Bilyi (commanded the squad of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking", which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UPA), now we came to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we were lacking.
We say that there was a big problem with the water.
They broke into the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "the Russians will take it anyway" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is a video on the internet where children thank Kadyrov for the food.
So after they robbed the store, they brought the sausages and said: "We understand that it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
Nobody really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful arrangement.
Our child there says: "You have 7 days to return our phones" - they laughed.
Moreover, they constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said it was good that they came because they didn't want war, they support Ukrainians, and in general are good: "Putin is a degenerate, so is Kadyrov, but we can't do anything because our families are there."
And mainly they did not fight, but went to loot stores and marauded.
They brought in a bunch of chickens, tied a St. George ribbon to one leg of one of them, and their white tape to the other, and called her "militia woman."
In Ukraine, they arrived completely unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten in Bucha, so much so that they didn't even take their dead, they asked us: "Do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had assembled units - the Chechens didn't know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords to identify whether they were friend or foe.
They were with us until the 13th of March, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Omsk Airborne.
They placed 30-40 units of equipment between the buildings - ours constantly hit them with "Bayraktars".
But they were coming and telling us that there are no ZSU anymore, but there is "Azov", and according to their words, there are about 100 thousand "Azov" in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been promoted since early March.
Once a Russian came to us - either a paratrooper officer or a representative of the FSB - and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio - there was information about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought maybe they would give us a "green corridor" as well.
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But they tell us: "You are being taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."
We say that we don't want to go either there or there.
What they replied was: "Then, take care of your children's mental health!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house - either with "Grads" or mortars.
And then it flew back... Neighboring houses just burned down, part of them collapsed.
In our house, there was a direct hit on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Part of them didn't go, saying that it's for traitors of the homeland ‚Äì supposedly, "you'll be shot there, [and] sold for organs."
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were ruins, broken equipment, although the Belarusians told us that the Russians immediately export the equipment to them.
Very many bunkers, buried equipment, and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed an improvised control, many people were without documents at all, because they burned down.
We were placed in Red Cross tents and given tea.
And then we hear gunshots! A missile is fired, and a trail is visible - it's the "Iskander" targeting Kyiv.
Although those from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, these are planes flying, turning around at the border."
But we are from aviation, have education, and understand what it is.
Next, we were loaded onto a bus and taken to the "Chonky" sanatorium near Gomel.
His manager, Venger Vasyl Stepanovich, came and said: "Here I am, a Ukrainian, I am from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until they finish off your thieves.
The poor people suffer!
And we have such a good Lukashenko!
As he says, so it will be.
They offered to give an interview to Belarusian journalists, but nobody wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "You are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN representation (at least they called themselves that) spread disinformation that men cannot go to Poland.
Many people believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we still decided to go abroad, even though we had a problem with documents - our daughter did not have an international passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, but the war started on Thursday.
In the Ukrainian consulate, they couldn't help us with anything, and in Minsk at the train station, they said that without passports, no one would be allowed on the bus.
Here I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were settled in Minsk, and the escort was provided.
In the sanatorium, they did not hold by force.
Our second group's migration representative said that you can stay here for a maximum of one to one and a half weeks, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw launches of ballistic missiles towards Ukraine: the missile first takes off, shines beautifully, and then goes out.
People who got on the bus in Mozyr reported that Russians constantly shoot from the training grounds there.
But I can say that Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals are being discharged from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something for her son if he gets called up.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is located, generally does not believe.
They say: "You are lying, we are a peaceful nation."
They do not perceive that their training grounds are being used for shelling Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting who took us to Estonia.
Currently, we are going through the registration process and deciding what we will do next.
In Estonia, there are probably as many Ukrainian flags as there are Estonian ones right now.
Marina lived in the military town of Hostomel together with her brother's family - his wife and two children, aged 18 and 22.
In the morning of February 24th, she called her nephews and asked them to gather the most essential things and documents.
In the evening, they went to spend the night in the basement of the neighboring building.
Marina herself couldn't return home and essentially won't be able to ‚Äì the house is gone.
English: Nobody really knew anything about the evacuation.
And on Monday, will you not be able to somewhere in the center?
Thank you, we have everything. And we are always waiting for you as guests!
Thank you for the agreement, the butterflies are beautiful
And in this small apartment there is no Wi-Fi, mostly I answer all your questions and now I don't know what to do? And starting from Monday, the children have online classes, but there is no internet.
So, I will live with two women from Ukraine and their children? Is this a family that is ready to accept us?

Maryana is a specialist in eyelash extension and she can work from home, while the other Maryana doesn't have any special skills, meaning she is also a general worker.
Can we agree on the best way to do this?
On April 1st, the city mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, shared the joyful news ‚Äì Ukrainian military forces had liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31st.
The next day, the occupiers were expelled from the entire Kyiv region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should have felt at that moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because it became known that in Bucha alone, Russians shot at least 280 peaceful residents.
They were killed right on the street, some had their hands tied and were shot in the back of the head, a part of the killed were minors.
The village elder of Motyzhyn, Olha Suhenko, her husband Ihor, and son Oleksandr were found dead with signs of torture, after being kidnapped on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Oleksandr were in a mass grave, Ihor's - in the sewer.
On both sides of the highway, 20 km from Kyiv, they discovered the bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket.
Russians tried to burn them.

President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
About this, he said in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, writes "European Truth".
All the equipment, everything they are already sending, for some types of equipment it has been done too late.
English: So, when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100-percent support, it is really true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," said Zelensky.
On the question of whether Ukraine has received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "Not yet, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine were a NATO member, this war would not have taken place, or it would have had a different appearance.
English: "It would have unfolded differently, we would have had the shoulder of close neighbors, we could have fought together.
But he was sure that there would not have been a war after all," - he added.
Reminder: The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.

If this is the case, then I will be able to, for example, work a few days a week for several hours.
For exactly how many hours and on which days will I see how it goes for me, so that I can also go for cleaning apartments, as they pay more for cleaning there, so I don't want to refuse that job either.
I am a water supply technician, so I can taste the water quality immediately.
She said there are inexpensive and tasty cakes there
But overall, everything is good
By the way, can I submit tests these days?
In the evening, I might go live if they let me go home for the night! ) You'll see me üòá
There are currently 3 of us (me and the kids aged 3 and 17 years), possibly later my husband will move in with us, as he is currently staying in a dormitory.
How long do the courses last and what language level can be expected after completing them?
Great, so on Monday I am free.
And that would be very good for me.
I will prepare all the materials.
I have a great book where the Czech language is step by step.
English: The only time I would really appreciate if possible would be 13:00-14:00 because I work until 12:30.
To be able to get to that place in time. Will it be so good?
None, that after the war. None, that you didn't think of.

In the Czech Republic, there are very nice people. I came on vacation to visit my children aged 10 and 15 and grandma (located in Marianske Lazne).
It is impossible to understand these women.
We offer free accommodation.
We live in a village in a large family house with a big garden and a closed courtyard between Yihlava and Havlichkuv Brod.
We have 2 small children.
We will provide a room.
The kitchen, bathroom, and other rooms are shared.

Thank you very much for your care.

My husband can bring him to your house tomorrow or on Saturday. If that suits you.
No, he didn't call, the guys passed it on through the chain. I know for sure that God is with him.
Ok, then we can go to the playground near the river.
For everything there is a time. If you don't have your own family now, it means that the time hasn't come yet. It also means that when you do have a family, it will be 10 times bigger and closer than it should have been.

All were sick, and they had symptoms, but we did not go to the hospital.
Just now, a woman called me from DameYdlo and said that they sent me an email with information about further actions, but I haven't responded yet.

In men, there are also many nuances
He was a very wealthy person, but he liked me because I had my own perspective on life. I met with him, then left him.
He was a very wealthy person. After some time, he called and informed that he had undergone heart surgery.
He asked me just to talk and support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very wealthy person and thought that I could be his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he made me an offer
The car was standing in my yard, resembling a crocodile, and it was shooting hail.
And they kept me in the house, then took me to the basement, and there were many people there, about 400 people, there was nothing to breathe.
And regarding the accommodation, what about the photos you sent?
I haven't really gotten there yet
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already debunked this fake.

Okay, he will come there and pick them up.
I am not greedy for everything
I understand that I can't sit with you, I need to work
I understand. Thank you, but we do not need 1+1 and generally Ukrainian television.
I see all the news on the Internet.
And 1+1 is a pro-presidential, propagandist channel, not interesting for me at all.
What happened at the bus stop with the man that the police and ambulance arrived? Is everything okay with him?
Diana did not answer me and you
Alright, I just need to print out coloring pages for the children. So that will be good. When can I come?
But maybe you need a more detailed knowledge of the Czech language.
I worry that you will be satisfied with my work.
In this case, I know a girl who is Ukrainian, but studies in the Czech Republic, majoring in tourism.
You really don't want to come for a minute with the kids calmly and with grandma.
I want you to be with me. Waking up next to you.
In general, it is hard to live in a foreign country, with each passing day the desire to go home increases.
Mrs. Agata, if you need this photo, I will take a picture.

English: "I tell her that the "repair of the TV and radio receiver" dragged on due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances have been warned not to blurt out anything extra when they call."
For the whole month, we've been hiding information about the war from our mothers-in-law.
So far, it's working out.
However, in Plyamka (a cat ‚Äì UP), the fur has fallen out on the belly and hind legs ‚Äì this could be due to stress, change in diet, and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, but unfortunately, the stress is not dependent on me.
A stain, unlike remorse, is not deaf, it hears both sirens and explosions.
Thanks to the fact that Olga has poor hearing and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in the apartment with her "incognito" for a month.
On April 1st, 93-year-old Oksana Polova took up arms for the first time in her life.
English: "For 33 days, I lived with her in the apartment like a partisan."
From her, they hid both the war and the fact that I was nearby - I formally came as always for several hours.
English: But when her friend started talking, I gave her the receiver ‚Äì she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours.
The radio receiver was always near the bed.
Most of the time, the mother-in-law spends in her room.
Hears poorly - this allowed me to be unnoticed by her.
If I heard the sound of her "steps", I would hide in my room.
First of all, she hid the receiver and TV from her.
Then she called everyone she communicates with. That's 6-7 people.
She asked to talk with her about anything, just not about the war.
I will ask my friend, she was there from the very beginning until the end.
On April 17th - I have cleaning of 2 apartments :)
Good evening, I somehow didn't even think about it :)
Hello, if our help is needed tomorrow, we can come.
English: Is it mandatory to order lunch, or can I bring lunch from home? Do I need to print these documents, or will they be printed on site and I can sign them there?
I offer men's, women's, and children's haircuts with a visit to your place. Anyone interested, please write in private messages. Price:
I understand you and do not complain, but in my situation, I will continue searching here for now.
I'm telling you, the embassy is only here.
English: The Briton who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The British man, who is a serviceman of the Marine Corps Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine participating in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they will lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupants.
Source: Twitter page of Aidan Eyslin, a Briton who served in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine since 2018, BBC referring to family members and friends of Eyslin, Atlas News citing the words of Eyslin's friend who spoke with him
Aislinn's literal tweet: "We received a message from him: "It's been 48 days, we've tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian forces."
We have run out of food and ammunition.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will end soon.
Details: Eyslin served in the 36th separate marine brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is participating in the defensive operation of Mariupol.
BBC journalists contacted the mother of soldier En Wood, and she confirmed that her son informed her over the phone that they plan to surrender.
English: Friend of the military Brennan Phillips also confirmed to journalists that in the last phone call, Aislin spoke about the plans for their unit's surrender.
According to him, the brigade has run out of ammunition and food.
Journalists from Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that Eyslin's unit intends to surrender to Russian units in order not to fall into the hands of the so-called "Kadyrovtsy" without weapons and bullets.
Also, on social networks, an audio recording of a phone conversation was spread, in which Aislinn seems to be talking with her American friend who plans to travel to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Aislinn said that they tried to leave the city in civilian clothes, but they were unsuccessful.
Earlier, the Briton reported that representatives of the private military company "Wagner" threatened him on Instagram.
Eyslin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to participate in the fights against terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
In English: Eyslina's friends and family called her Johnny, and on social media, she is more known under the nickname Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you. But I would also like to know. Are we together or not.
But it won't be easy, you will have to find him...

And how much does it cost to rent a two-room apartment in Prague?

The climate is almost the same.
The family is good, I have my mother left, three brothers, and a husband.
One brother is in the war in Mariupol, the other is in Zaporizhia, and today my husband was transferred from Kyiv to Kharkiv.
They call every day saying everything is fine, but who knows, they won't tell the truth anyway.
English: I wanted to come to you, but I still wanted to deal with some matters.
I will ask the man in the morning if he will make it tomorrow.
When you come home, please write to me, I needed to communicate with Danylo.
The Bolshevik attackers fully retaliated for their losses in battle.
English: They shot the teacher Dmytro Pavlytsky, his unknown by name relative, and the young man Boris Oleksiyenko.
Their bodies were thrown into a "deep waste pit, which was covered with earth."
According to memories, "there was some dead silence in the city."
English: Rarely, someone from the residents would run from house to house at a jog.
On the streets, one could constantly encounter bodies tortured by the Bolsheviks
And maybe, I will really go after you. I need you. I can't be without you.
3. What personal activities/actions have helped you or your friends to adapt better to life in the Czech Republic?
But you will not get there, because there is a railway reconstruction here and the entrance is closed.
Reach the bridge where the reconstruction is, tell me that you have arrived, and I will come up to you.
We are waiting for the best future
Lena, can we give you the things that did not fit us in size, or should we give them to Katya?
Yes, I stopped waking up in the middle of the night.
In the morning, I wake up very early without an alarm clock.
I sleep for 4-5 hours currently, but I'm already asleep.
Marina couldn't wake me up today when they arrived)) But it takes time, it has to pass

English: Alright, we will try to go to the social services on Tuesday.

Alright, I will definitely ask him.
As soon as we get settled tomorrow evening, I will call him on Tuesday.
I want to be able to thank everyone who helped us, because it was our last hope, really.
I am not afraid of work, as I have also lived in the village, so I can and like to work physically.
When can we bring you the things?
Very interesting tradition you have, we have such a walk during Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted bill 7176, which is titled "On conducting monitoring of potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the field of economy."
It is surprising that, in essence, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere turned out to be... the place where the members of the supervisory boards of state-owned companies and state banks hold their meetings.
Initiators of the bill believe that decision-making by the supervisory board of a state-owned company in the conditional Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of Ukraine's national security.
We are aware of a large number of new risks for state-owned companies, but so far, we do not know of any company that has had the need to physically hold a meeting of the supervisory board at the address of its location.
The potential threat from such a law is clear - it is an excellent basis for "destroying" all the achievements in the difficult reform of state enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual control.
Such as it was before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies need supervisory boards and who should be included in them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill "takes off" under patriotic slogans, then tomorrow others may also take off - for example, it is possible to demolish the public procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU).
Many things can be attributed to the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the beginning of the war and the draft law 7176.
So, on February 22, this regulation was included in the comparative table of bill 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some people's representatives for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to demonstrate the possible consequences of the draft law, let's examine the arguments used to explain the necessity of its adoption.
And then we will provide our suggestions on how to solve the issue of state enterprise management during the war.
English: The First Deputy Minister of Economy, Denys Kudin, explained the necessity of such an innovation by the risks of losing the internet and other means of communication, which would make remote work of supervisory boards impossible.
In other words, the risk lies in the fact that the supervisory board may not be able to make the necessary decisions, which may result in the paralysis of the company's work.
We agree that there is such a risk, but can the relocation of supervisory board members to Ukraine prevent it?
Imagine a fairly cynical situation where independent members of supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) put their personal safety above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In that case, according to the draft law, they can be dismissed.
And then, most likely, it will lead to the loss of the quorum required for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
On the other hand, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, as the law requires a competitive selection process, which on average takes 3-4 months.
So, the decision proposed by the bill 7176 will most likely not be able to protect from the loss of the supervisory board's ability to make decisions, but rather, on the contrary, will lead to this!
People's Deputy, author of the bill Dmytro Natalukha provides other arguments in its support.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, including the defense industrial complex (DIC), currently need relocation" and therefore "it is hard to imagine that someone can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vienna via Zoom".
To begin with, in Ukraine, there are almost no state-owned defense industry enterprises that have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board exists in "Ukroboronprom", which essentially manages almost all state-owned enterprises in the defense industry complex.
But even in "Ukroboronprom", according to the legislation, the supervisory board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform their duties on a non-gratuitous basis.
The full extent of authority in "Ukroboronprom" belongs to the General Director, who, by the way, will make decisions regarding the necessity of relocating a particular defense industry enterprise that is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand up to criticism also because bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned defense industry enterprises.
English: Mr. Dmytro also presents arguments on his Facebook page that can be attributed to the category of "emotional."
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with increasing the efficiency of state-owned companies and state banks, but let's try to understand some of them: "respectable foreign experts, at the very first mention of "war" in 2021, leave Ukraine, but at the same time remain members of the supervisory boards of Ukrainian state enterprises with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself is really suffering from the war."
Firstly, this is manipulation - the majority of such supervisory board members have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically traveled here.
English: Therefore, saying that they are "leaving Ukraine", to put it mildly, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This instrument has long been widespread in global practice, and in absolutely different spheres: business, education, medicine, and so on.
It's also worth noting that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other occupations, and it is electronic communication means that help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively against foreigners.
Interesting, why doesn't Mr. Dmytro express identical complaints to members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is far from the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is just a new convenient opportunity.

In Brovarsky, Vyshgorodsky and Buchansky districts of Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, an enhanced curfew will be introduced for 2 days.
Direct speech of Pavliuk: "In the populated areas of Brovarsky, Vyshgorodsky and Buchansky districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been strengthened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, restrictions will be in effect from 21:00 on April 2nd until 06:00 on April 5th.
Details: According to the head of the regional administration, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport or on foot.
Residents can only go outside during the alarm signal to enter the shelter.
Such restrictions are imposed in order to eliminate the consequences of Russian aggression - to clean and demine the territories.
Omelyanuk urged people who have left these areas to refrain from returning home for now.
English: On the rest of the Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

The Serbian defense budget has been growing exponentially for several years in a row.
Overall, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, updating military equipment, and acquiring modern systems, climbing 22 places in the list of the world's most powerful military states.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries took the predictions of a possible escalation in the Balkans quite seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic resolution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict becomes more complicated and globalized.

Belarusian security forces of Lukashenko's regime detained three Belarusians aged 27 and 28, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signaling system near Osipovichi that ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radio Svoboda", human rights center "Viasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Hennadiy Kazakevich, quoted by the state information agency "BelTA"
In the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, it was reported that during the night of March 30, with the support of special forces "SOBR", three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one of whom was wounded.
According to "Vyasna", during the arrest, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees received an injury and is in a medical facility.
Other people were provided with medical assistance on the spot.
Head of the Criminal Police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennadiy Kazakevich, stated that "acts of terrorism on the railways of the Republic of Belarus will be harshly stopped" by law enforcement using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian Railways, an employee of the Baranovichi branch of "BZD" and an administrator of thematic resources "BZD" on "VKontakte" and "Odnoklassniki" - Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, no fewer than 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
Reminder: The formation of BYpol, declared extremist by Lukashenko's regime, continues to urge Belarusians to carry out sabotage on railway transport and infrastructure facilities in Belarus as part of the "Victory" plan.
Belarusian "rail partisans" are trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine in this way.
As it is known, Russia is transferring live forces and equipment through Belarus to fight in Ukraine.
This is for boosting self-esteem
Do you love to read books?
And in phone mode, do they also not work on Easter holidays?
Can this be done over the phone on any day or not?
Even a separate law was adopted regarding this issue
We traveled here for 4 days, this road is just a nightmare.
They were traveling through the Kyiv region, the city of Irpin, and it was terrible there, shooting, sirens.
I worry about them too.
Silvia, Masha still hasn't received the funds from Kletsana, can we give them a call?
Yes, I will tell them, I think they will be at home.
There are different Muslims. There are fanatics, and there are truly believers.
The meaning of jihad is interpreted differently by various Muslims.
But to be honest, I feel very uncomfortable doing this for money.
You have done a lot of good for me.
I can do it for free.
Temporarily for the period while we are looking for a university, then of course permanent accommodation will be needed.
But maybe she will have a dormitory. (Looking for Prague, Brno, and other places)
We are currently not far from Prague, we have a car, and we are ready to partially pay for our accommodation.
City or village does not matter, it is desirable that it is a separate dwelling.
I accidentally clicked something in Vodafone and connected two unnecessary promotions for which funds were withdrawn, and I cannot disconnect them üò≠

And I don't understand why the money was taken

USA bans investments in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, along with the G7 and the EU, are imposing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, the largest Russian banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank, and also prohibiting all new investments in Russia.
English: This is mentioned in a message on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the US financial system and prohibit US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
For this purpose, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree, which includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
English: "This step is based on the decision to exit Russia, adopted by over 600 transnational companies."
The exit of the private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers, such as legal and consulting firms," according to a White House statement.
The third step of new sanctions from the US involved restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in critical sectors.
This will prohibit US citizens from conducting operations with these organizations and freeze any of their assets within the jurisdiction of the States.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list on the following day, Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of assets of Putin's adult children, wives and daughters of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including ex-president and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions disconnect them from the US financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.
You can only reach up to this place, the passage further is closed and I will come to you.
Vera, can we wash the dishes in the machine now?
My name is Olga, before the war I worked as a flight attendant for SkyUp company, my mother is a seamstress of industrial products, and my son Makarchik attended kindergarten.
We lived beautifully, but didn't even think that we would be forced to flee, because there is no strength left to hide in the basement.
I am lucky and I found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
Therefore, we hope that someone will give us shelter for the first time) We can even pay for a room or an apartment, but only if it's within our budget.
We guarantee cleanliness and order.
We do not have harmful habits.
We will be grateful for such assistance during this difficult time for us.
After lunch, I had one English lesson, and after it, I also went to work in the children's room.
I explained to Margarita how to fill out all the documents there.
I hope she understood everything and will perform everything well.
And I also met Mrs. Lena and talked with her about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought the announcement from the swimming pool.
This is free swimming.
Can you call the school? Kira is not answering the phone, not responding, I don't know if she made it to the school.

I would gladly rent a place with some decent girl.

From my side - I will not let down.
Thank you in advance.
English: I haven't written to you about another person, Natalya, 54 years old. Please write the exact address and how much the courses cost.
I think it would be better for you to make copies of our passports, as they contain all the necessary information.
Surname I did not change, it is the only one I have had since birth :)
Good afternoon, Mr. Reyrard! I apologize, I didn't see it. I will do it right now and send it to you immediately.

Tomorrow I will finish listening, the Internet is working poorly. Good night

We will somehow manage this.
But how will this be paid for, please, no credits.
Write to me directly, and I will help.
We are your partner, or I am not your partner.

Something came from you, I don't see what
I am also very sad
I will remind you about the texture later
Does only your father speak and understand Russian?
In which day does the colleague want to do the house cleaning and how many windows does the house have?
I am embarrassed for distracting you from your affairs
Good evening, I can't help but share with you. There is news from Mariupol about the son - alive and in good shape.
I recommend reading Joe Dispenza, he scientifically conducts research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neuronal connections.
English: Journalist Natalia Nagorna of the "1+1" TV channel published a video on the morning of April 12, which was handed to her by the military of the 36th Marine Infantry Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military say that they have no weapons left to participate in the battles, and there are many wounded.
They said that "the countdown is in hours."
Before this, on April 11th, the 36th separate marine brigade, which is involved in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian language.
In the statement, it was mentioned that April 11th could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command had not been in contact with the fighters for two weeks.
In social networks, there was skepticism expressed that the statement was published in Russian language.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valeriy Zaluzhny, assured that there is a connection with the defense forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defensive operation should not be a subject of public discussion.
Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the "Azovstal" plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
In the evening of April 11, Russian occupiers dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of "Azov" Andriy Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the "Azovstal" plant, which is held by the fighters of the "Azov" regiment.
Thank you, I will adjust to suit you. That would be very good.
The situation is the same, for now we stay here
2 hours of driving)) walks, mom shopping and back)!
It's not an important matter
She forgot what to do here
English: A squadron of Czechüá®üáø drones began flying over Ukraineüá∫üá¶ today.
Almost 50 professional dronesüöÅ will be used for detection, and some of them will be used for the direct destruction of enemy invadersüí•.
Two Zakarpattia and two Czech brothers "birds" were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of Mukachevo City Council, Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today, their friends from Mizhhirya, led by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur, delivered the drones to their intended recipients: they were received by special units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in various cities where combat operations are currently ongoing.
In order to ensure the most effective and safe use of drones, their current deployment location will be kept confidential for now.
Four friends from the Czech Republic, who are helping the Ukrainian army, do not plan to stop; they say that in the coming days, they will send many more interesting "gifts" to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupant and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
Don't worry, everything is fine. I love sweet things, but I can do without them.
I am worried that we will not make it. Lots of luggage.
Soon returning to Ukraine, then working
Alright. If everything is fine, I agree.
I will try to do it myself, but if there are any problems, I will write to you, if that's okay?
The main thing is to understand each other
We personally went to the headwoman in the village in Lviv, she saw me and that I am pregnant, but said that there is no housing available.
Maybe she will be happy and her mood will improve.
Today my phone was repaired.
And I think that today I also got really cold outside.
Drank medicine and tea, feeling worse, but not critical.
I am sorry too, but it is better to meet when I am healthy.
When you have time, send me music that you like.
I'm curious about your musical achievements üòä
Mom and dad should be listened to
You will find it somewhere near your little brother's stroller.
Today it was cooler here and rain. Tomorrow it is supposed to be warm.
But it's not a pity for destroyed houses, it's a pity for people over whom the occupiers mock.
In Kherson, occupiers mocked the "Glory to Ukraine" memorial in Kherson on Perekopska street.
Details: It is noted that unknown individuals tore down the European Union flag, destroyed panels with photographs of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
Occupants tore down portraits of the Heavenly Hundred heroes and fallen participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
Removed the flag.
Good morning, thank you to the children for the carol, we do not have such a tradition so we did not know, we gave the children only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else was needed to be given.
In Czech, there is someone to talk to, if needed.
Because I live in a dormitory-type place, there will be people here until twelve, and then they go to work.
Hello, already a little better.
English: Today I have already been to the kindergarten.
Even today he already slept there.
English: Therefore, we already have great progress.
I will definitely bring varenyky next time!
Today I don't have the strength to do them
Since I am pushing off from the days and time in which there is cleaning work for apartments after guests, I can approximately say for the month of April because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments.
In the month of May - I can roughly say at the end of April or at the beginning of May.
Just asked if you have anything to say about this.
Hello, sorry for not replying for a long time, I was preparing dinner and took a short nap.
If you don't mind, could I come today?)
English: Or let's meet after your arrival)
English: He is modest among us; lately, he has been studying a lot. He realized that it is very much needed in his life.
Hello) everything went very well.
I was a little shocked that I work with people at such a high position.
English: Today I had a lesson with a lady who is the director of the regional economics department in Vysocina.
She was very satisfied with my work.
Grishko behaved well in the nursery.
On Monday, I have to bring confirmation of employment and also pay in cash for the daycare.

If tomorrow he/she goes to the doctor, I would go with you if possible.
I have to bring one more analysis
But it won't be necessary to go there again
Very poor performance of the flush tank, it flushes badly. A master is needed. Needs to be adjusted.
English: So there is enough of everything there
Can you send me the correct email address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course that you have signed up for.
And do they feed children there or do we need to bring food with us?
And now for a moment, can I come to you with one question?
If you need any more help, feel free to write.
If I'm not mistaken, you are celebrating Easter today, right?
From the very beginning, we didn't really want you to raise funds, so that people would not think that we are speculating on this!
But for online completion, two points were not enough for me:
I will go to rest. Recharge my strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Good night.
üòÑüòçWhat a wonderful idea. I will watch the video now. This will be great because the whole family will be drawing.
Kharkiv Karazin University urges employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors, and gossip.
Rely only on official information.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who stayed in Ukraine, also helps the army.
Gathered a few works for the portfolio.
After the holidays, they have to set up the internet.
I would like to be your backup designer.
How will they count the day when I was absent from work if I have a pass?
Headquarters information: Russia prepares provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state."
Literally: "It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation may carry out provocative actions in the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova with the aim of accusing Ukraine of aggression against the neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to build up offensive forces for actions in the Sloboda direction.
Probably, in the coming days, the occupants will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to carry out the preparation and dispatch of personnel, weapons, and equipment for participation in combat actions on the territory of Ukraine.
The preparation of arms and military equipment is underway at the permanent deployment point of the 60th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th General Military Army of the Eastern Military District.
Probably, the specified weapons will be relocated to the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region.
Also, to restore the lost personnel of the battalion tactical group units from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzya, Trans-Baikal Territory) of the 29th All-Military Army of the Eastern Military District, recruitment of servicemen from the mentioned brigade is being carried out.
The enemy faces a particular problem when staffing driver and mechanic-driver positions.
Departure of the selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
English: It is likely that the adversary, in order to disrupt the supply of cargo to the locations of military operations, will continue attacks on transportation infrastructure facilities in the territory of Ukraine with the aim of their destruction or incapacitation.
Certain units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
On the Sloboda direction, separate units from the 6th General Army and the coastal forces of the Northern Fleet continue the partial blockade of the city of Kharkiv, with artillery shelling of certain city districts ongoing.
On the Izium direction, aerial reconnaissance of the area continues with the aim of detecting positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this purpose, the enemy uses the UAV "Orlan-10".
English: With the forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the directions of the populated areas Dovhenke and Dmytrivka, but was unsuccessful and retreated to previously occupied positions.
On the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus its main efforts on taking control of the populated areas of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nyzhne, and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to conduct assault actions in the Zolote area but was not successful.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue assault actions in the areas of the "Azovstal" factory and the seaport.
With the forces of separate units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of the Ukrainian troops in the areas of populated settlements Vysokopillya, Trudolyubivka, and Mar'yanske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Ukrainian defenders repelled four enemy attacks during the past day, destroying five tanks, eight armored units, six automotive units, and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
Did not understand your thoughts?
We will certainly try to make it in time, but I have doubts
And how can you sleep if you want to, but I'm keeping you up
Are you sure you don't mind if I come?
English: Maybe you just don't feel like meeting today, just tell me, I will understand)
Thank you. We didn't watch TV at home either, and even more so 1+1. We don't need it set up :)
I turn on the TV here exclusively for the purpose of listening to the Czech language.
Today my monthly tariff package expires :)
Can we do this today over the phone?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, embroidery threads
I understand, so I can prepare material in this area.
I will ask her. I feel a little shy to ask, she already gives us so many pies.
We will definitely meet with my dad later, for sure üôèüèª
I read the announcement on Facebook, it seems like Google wrote something in its own wayüèµÔ∏è. I think the phone number is enough
Good day, we have taken the things you brought, but there are some items that are too small for us. Can you bring them to us in 10 minutes?
I thought about work-related issues.
If it works for the director, I can start going to work from next week because I plan to go to the employment office tomorrow before lunch to submit documents (if possible, because the lines are very long) and on Saturday it is going to rain :)
Looking for a team at the beginning, really liked chemistry in school, studying the Czech language to know it perfectly, dreaming of working at Teva.
Old and not so old friends, friends with whom I am not personally acquainted, friends in spirit and intellect.
Now hard times have come to you too.
Throughout the last month, I have communicated with many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned upside down, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing from Russia.
And many of you have admitted that you feel guilty and ashamed because of your country's actions towards your neighbors.
Due to the reason for subjecting Ukraine on your behalf.
Over some of you, activists, the threat has been looming for a long time, and you were preparing for a decisive blow.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Oleksandr Cherkasov, my very longtime friend from the "Memorial".
I'll tell you a bit later, - as usual, Sasha replied laconically. - Now, after the search, we walk around the ruins.
English: Others, however ‚Äì cultural figures, artists, critics, writers ‚Äì are shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, the majority of you hate them.
But let's be frank: with the exception of very few of you - those who worked at "Memorial", in "Novaya Gazeta", on "Echo of Moscow", in "Meduza", Navalny's organization and a number of other places, - how many of you have done even something to resist this regime?
Except for maybe participating in rallies, when they still took place.
Also read the column by the Russian journalist "It's too late to hide, too late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your feeling of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Maybe, they are caused by your long-lasting indifference to what is happening around, your apathy, and your passive participation, which now, probably, have heavily burdened your soul and heart?
It was not always like this.
In the 1990s, there was a brief period when you had a certain degree of freedom and democracy - chaotic and even bloody, but genuine.
But the year 1991 turned out to be no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you eventually become so overwhelmed with fear of chaos that you seek salvation behind the back of a tsar, be it Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he has killed, you still feel safer around him. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and publicizing the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you focused on the Dzerzhinsky monument - and allowed the KGB to lay low, rejuvenate, reorganize, and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with the choice between the plunder of the country and the return of the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option - and meekly reconciled with the plunder.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern became survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and boost the economy.
Few of you fell for it, but you either voted for him or preferred not to vote at all.
When he started leveling Chechnya to the ground again, most of you turned a blind eye to it.
I remember those years well.
At that time, I was working in Chechnya, helping those affected by Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Katar-Yurt, Itum-Kale and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I would return to Moscow and have a great time hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: about the torture of civilians, the killed children, and the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me: "Breda, we are already tired of your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.
In response, I was indignant: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I am just a foolish foreigner here.
This is your government bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens.
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic upswing in the mid-zeroes, caused by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to turn a blind eye to the fact that some of the stolen money would remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have started earning well, some have become rich, and even the poorest among you have acquired new housing and found a better job.
Prices were rising, but is it really a problem?
Moscow was festively shining and sparkling with elegance.
When several opposition members - Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko, and others - were killed, many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.
However, things did not go further.
When after two terms Putin handed over the presidency to Medvedev and took the position of prime minister himself, you, as I can see, barely paid attention to it.
When after several months of Medvedev's rule Russia invaded Georgia, most of you either ignored it or remained silent.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi, or in cafes and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while parts of this country were occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we in the West probably didn't do much, if we did anything at all.
A little indignation, a little sanctions; but what did it matter that Russia was blatantly violating international law when there was such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas, and domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, it was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, finally woke up.
When Putin once again swapped places with Medvedev and took the presidential seat, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you massively took to the streets to protest.
Navalny's name has become a rallying cry, you haven't left the streets for half a year, and eventually, the regime has terrifyingly realized that it's losing ground.
After that, he delivered a blow in response.
At first, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands ended up behind bars.
Someone received enormous terms.
"And what could we have done?"
I've heard this so often and still hear it now.
"The state is so strong, yet we are so weak."
Well, take a look at Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Enraged by the pro-Russian president who deceived their European aspirations, they once occupied Maidan - and never left it again.
They independently set up a tent camp and prepared for a determined defense.
When the police arrived and tried to destroy it, they started defending themselves using sticks, rebar, and Molotov cocktails.
In the end, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the offensive.
Many died, but they prevailed.
Yanukovych became the fugitive, and Ukrainians regained their democracy, the right to independently choose their leaders, and to expel them if they do a poor job.
Maidan really displeased Putin.
This was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he seized Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but there was little benefit from it.
And how many of you were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Suddenly, a new myth was born, and many of you, who used to despise Putin and his gang, suddenly turned 180 degrees and started to adore him.
It is difficult for me to find the reason, as right after this we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We are not interested in politics," you said.
And you hid in new books, movies, IKEA catalogs, and parks, completely like new ones after the restoration, which the Moscow mayor started in 2012 ‚Äì with their beanbags, public Wi-Fi, and hipster cafes.
Indeed, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and it only gets better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor, who published my book about Syria, criticized it in an interview, because apparently I understood nothing about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least, I went there and saw for myself how, on the streets of Homs, government snipers cold-bloodedly shoot at my children's peers.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers have been there, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of peaceful residents, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Undoubtedly, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niemoller:
First, they came for the socialists, but I kept silent - because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the union members, but I remained silent - because I am not a union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent - because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say something in my defense.
English: How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you have done this.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some people really do speak now ‚Äì like, for example, Dmytro Glukhovsky, Mykhailo Shyshkin, Mykhailo Zygar, Maksym Osipov, and others.
The majority allows themselves to speak from abroad, while some, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risk getting into a new GULAG or joining Navalny from within the country.
As for the others, you know best which country you live in.
So, I am sure you understand: when Putin deals with Ukrainians - or, which seems very likely, if he fails - he will come after you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who bravely, but mostly alone, went to protests and so far have served a short term, but will soon receive a more serious one.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, expressed disagreement on social networks (even if only with a black square on Instagram), or spoke out in private conversations with colleagues at work.
Times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given just for a joke have not remained in such a distant past - and now they are, with a high probability, waiting for you in the future.
English: Who will then speak for you? Who will be left?
The example of Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - scares the Putin regime: they prove that it is possible to fight against it.
And that reason, motivation, and courage can stop him, no matter how oppressive his advantage may seem on paper.
Taking into account everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that there is an ongoing war in general.
But you, my friends, know well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the internet, and you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows that you know.
Therefore, be prepared.
You understand where all this is going.
Beautiful life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your choices are simply a joke, your laws, excluding the repressive ones, are not worth more than the paper they are written on, the last of your free media no longer exists, your economy collapses faster than I can write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if some flights still remain.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your submission.
And, if you do not give him what he wants, you can try either to somehow leave or you will be crushed.
I doubt that you see any other option.
And yet, there is still one more left.
In the end, which will ultimately bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, under the circumstances that have arisen, less will be required from you than you think.
English: Think about it.
The spark will not ignite from you: due to the economic collapse looming over Russia, it will most likely flare up in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices soar and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years, wanting bread and peace, will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and Saint Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city holds rallies individually, as has already periodically happened, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them one by one.
Necessary organization and coordination will be needed. The crowd will need to be transformed into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool - the internet, which the regime can limit, but which still works and can be adjusted almost under any circumstances.
Navalny's organization was dismantled, but it is possible to create others, more informal, more decentralized.
There are so many of you, millions of you.
Moscow police can handle 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, possibly even with a hundred thousand.
If it exceeds 300 thousand, she will be amazed.
It will be necessary to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to action?
After everything he made them do in Ukraine, all that he forced them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will experience understandable fear; those who have children will be afraid for them.
And this is natural, this is normal.
I would be scared in your place too.
On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to disregard their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but to truly try to achieve it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will make a joke in a computer game chat - and will be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the Internet - and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and will die in a police cell under police batons.
Here is what has been happening for many years - and will continue to intensify, gaining larger and larger scales.
So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know what the outcome will be.
Act calmly, think strategically, and achieve making this a reality.
We were at the class on Friday, and we were told that we could come on Monday.
In the evening we will be at home

Because when the children were going home, one mother refused to pick up her child, saying that she came to look at things and arrange them in that room with clothes, and Mr. Valeriy opened our children's room for her until 19:00 yesterday.
Is it really possible?
