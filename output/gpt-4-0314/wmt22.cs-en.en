The big return of the Czech unlucky person is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL.
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning back to the NHL.
The 31-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the bench and could soon make it to the goal as well.
Former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Plzeň, or Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
Exactly halfway through the match with Vegas, he was substituted, and since then he has not yet appeared on the NHL ice rinks.
The incident occurred at the moment when the experienced goalkeeper moved from one post to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks due to a lower body injury," announced the Denver team at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL goal was eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, American time, he was called up from the farm where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he recorded 94.5% of the saves.
The product of Pilsen hockey finally wants to assert himself and confirm that he belongs in the best league in the world.
In the last season, he had problems with his hips and in the shortened pandemic season, he did not play a single match.
In the NHL, "Francík" played in 36 games, with his save percentage at 92.3%.
English: Charles puts a face mask on Camille for the Christmas greeting, William and Kate pose in Jordan
English: British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas wish this year.
Prince Charles also made his wish public, using a photo in which he helps his wife Camilla put on a face mask at the races.
On its website, the British news station BBC reported about it.
Wishes are sent to friends, colleagues, and foundations with whom they cooperate.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color, and Princess Charlotte is also wearing a dress.
English: Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a collared shirt just like Prince George and Louis.
Who took the photo, William and Kate did not specify, it is not even clear when exactly it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country residence in Norfolk County for a photograph intended as a Christmas greeting.
English: The photo, which will serve as a Christmas greeting, was also published by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, and his wife Camilla.
English: Photographer Sam Hussein captured it in June at the races in Ascot.
Charles, who has a cylinder hat on his head and a face mask on, is helping Camille put on her color-coordinated face mask that matches her light-colored dress.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbrov a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - Detectives in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the information that the accused former vice-president of the Czech Football Association, Roman Berbr, was promised a million crowns by the Prague Slavia club for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
English: The website efotbal.cz reported on this, stating that they obtained access to part of the police files.
Chairman of the board of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that the red and whites did not commit any corrupt behavior.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which the main figure from Slavia is its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who finished in the championship club last summer.
Former influential official of the red and whites was, according to the file, in frequent contact with both Berbr and former sports director of the then second-league Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
English: Criminal investigators reportedly worked with information that Slavia Berbrovi promised a financial reward for winning the title.
English: In 2019, the team SK Slavia Prague won the title in the first league.
The police authority had information that Roman (Berbr) was promised a million-dollar bribe from SK Slavia Prague officials for winning the league, the website quoted from the file.
A day later, according to criminal investigators, Berbr not only met with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the Slavia board, Tvrdik.
From the file, it is not clear, according to the server, whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík rejected any corrupt behavior.
English: Between 2015 and 2017, we actively strived for a change in the conditions of Czech football and offered an opposing alternative for its development.
We have never committed any illegal actions, sought to influence referees contrary to the rules of fair play, and provided no financial benefits to anyone in this context," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former dark-skinned Slavia players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing through referees was triggered last year in mid-October by a police raid at several locations, including the FAČR headquarters in Prague.
The highest-ranking person in the affair is Berbr, who no longer appears in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, just like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks, and armored personnel carriers are Cold War larping.
The guns will be new, but fundamentally of a worse type (artillerymen must leave the armored cabin and carry the rounds manually without cover).
Cars - Toyota Hi-Lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, plus they have already managed to get rid of the Praga V3S even for specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have any at all (but we manufacture and export them abroad)
English: Air Defense: middle - cold-war-era, outdated; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
I have a hunting ground right next to the city.
From the river, coypus were crawling and causing damage to crops, so I went there to sit down.
When I was coming, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I hoped that he would leave before something comes up, but of course, the fox went after a while.
I let her come within 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost crapped himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was just a fox.
Before I climbed down from the hunting stand, it was gone.
English: That means the meadow can be a mess for the man.
On the other hand, it's not a war, there would have to be a series of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be visible in thermal imaging, which almost everyone has today.
So, in a visible place, put valuable items by your feet in the sleeping bag and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Ministry of the Interior procured respirators at a significantly lower cost than the Ministry of Health.
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of face masks, masks, and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
English: The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that the amounts for respirators varied by hundreds of crowns during a single day.
English: Why have the prices changed so dramatically?
Which offices behaved economically?
And why did others shop more expensively?
English: Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with the editor of the iRozhlas website, Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and the army (probably not affected by memories of the Czechoslovak People's Army, which older generations experienced), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from mandatory military service.
We do not even have large warehouses of technology that trained people could handle, we do not actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, in addition modern technology is constantly becoming more complex, so the abilities of reservists will rapidly decline over time.
English: Modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can be deployed, will take place very quickly, and there won't be time to retrain someone.
And finally, reservists/territorial defense forces have great importance for countries like Ukraine, where massive guerrilla warfare can be conducted and it is also an explicit necessity for deterring the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, a battle will only take place in a conflict of such scale and intensity where guerilla warfare will already be irrelevant, and we do not even have suitable geography for it.
Mainly, we do not have individual skill.
That's not even the worst.
English: The worst part is that half of them play as if they had it.
English: Then such situations arise when you watch a guy who, 2 minutes ago, couldn't hit an empty goal, now attacks alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss players and you think to yourself, "tvl (damn), what do you think will happen now?".
Well, of course they will take him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "dribble past a defender" is so terrible that I caught myself being genuinely surprised when I see our striker manage to get around one of the opponent's players.
English: First swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down; however, experts do not expect any significant turnaround in the coming weeks.
The pressure on hospitals, according to statistical models, will still last for some time, and as is known, a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the Omicron variant, which is very likely spreading faster than the currently predominant Delta.
At the same time, it cannot be said with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course, to what extent vaccination helps against it, or the post-infection immunity acquired from a previous illness.
In the COVID equation, however, an unexpected phenomenon also entered on the plus side this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease progression and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be complemented by the drug Paxlovid from Pfizer, which, according to the current results, reports an efficacy rate of as much as 85 percent.
English: The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, however, besides offering hope for expanding the portfolio of useful tools in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how well the local administration is prepared for incoming drugs.
As mentioned, the first to reach domestic patients will be Merck's molnupiravir.
The company finished first on the tape also because the development of the drug began long before the outbreak of the current pandemic, with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for viral horse diseases in the South American continent.
In this research, it is often overlooked that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
English: They are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
English: Thus, Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are used to speaking "as our beak has grown".
English: Conduct a survey where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you no without hesitation.
In the West, they will tell you how much they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist bastards.
And then they go and vote for parties like AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing a job and media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the surveys, West good, East bad.
But it will really find out what people think.
In France, both Le Pen and Zemmour have over 20% according to a survey.
English: We even know that there are three objects in Czech and they are completely identical.
Identical due to the rotation of units, so soldiers don't have to relearn where everything is, all objects are exactly the same.
From one is the Atom Museum Brdy and the remaining two are abandoned.
English: The funny thing is, the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for security reasons or for the speed of deployment of warheads due to their more western position.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple tree), only the warheads were stored, not the entire rockets, as it is said.
English: If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit would arrive, which would pick up this warhead and mount it on some carrying device.
In addition to that museum maple, the remaining ones are in a desolate state.
English: In the second grade of elementary school, we had a Romani classmate, and we were with him for 4 years.
He was quite relaxed, made good jokes, often expressed himself too much, but he was kind of our mascot.
English: Everyone enjoyed talking to him, he often went and wanted to clarify something, he was rarely absent, attended regularly, played sports with us, didn't steal snacks or phones, and wore clean clothes.
He also went on school trips in nature, did various monkey business, but he was fine, probably never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, Gypsies, joined the same year, different classes.
Shortly after that, they beat up the teacher, the police often dealt with something there, they threatened and endangered other students.
Personally, I occasionally sell something in an advertisement (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Roma people, they always had money, they didn't try any attempts to stretch the price, communication was calm.
I even sold a car like this, the guy called after a month saying that he had already transferred it to his name.
About myself, I say that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue, or any other color, as long as they behave in a way that is appropriate for polite society (they work, function, do not beat women, basically display normal behavior).
But when someone comes, reaches out, clears out apartments and houses, has only chaos around them, causes problems... it doesn't matter what color they are, but it will bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants if they integrate, start businesses, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), and respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, it doesn't matter to me, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs too.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachaticko
"Young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokesperson for the South Bohemian emergency medical services, told Právo.
The accident was likely caused by the driver who was carrying the girl.
English: The eighteen-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was probably traveling from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov, and for unknown reasons, he went into the opposite lane in a curve.
After colliding with a Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on its roof off the road, described the accident spokesperson for the South Bohemian Police, Štěpánka Schwarzová.
English: The young Peugeot driver suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
It involved multiple injuries and he remained trapped in the vehicle.
After being rescued, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and was airlifted to the České Budějovice hospital in a stable condition, stated paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the second car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to the hospital.
For packages from countries outside the EU, new rules apply; customers often do not provide information about them.
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly collects trading cards.
"Usually, it can be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars upwards, where it's still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the postage is often free," the collector explains.
From October, ordering small shipments has become slightly more expensive for him, as he now needs to add VAT and provide customs information to the post office.
He will receive an email with the message that customs officers are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then, you just need to fill in the information about the shipment, and if the seller did not include VAT at the time of sale, the customs office will assess it from the total amount for the shipment and for transport.
In case the addressee does not arrange the customs clearance himself, the total amount must also include a fee for the carrier.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I will tick one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it usually takes about five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments, however, can be delivered smoothly.
Due to new customs regulations, the daily number of international parcels received at the Prague post office has decreased from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to Czech Post, another problem is that people do not respond to requests for providing information needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30 thousand shipments at the international post office that we need to process.
If people filled in all the required information, and did so on time, we would be about halfway there, says the spokesperson for the Czech Postal Service, Matyáš Vitík.
Solution to inflation
English: See the title, how would you suggest a solution to the current inflation?
Currently, we are at 9.9% inflation and further growth is expected.
What do you think the state should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, a reduction in VAT on food and fuel in Poland. Is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where it is heading?
English: Prices are rising faster than wages, in my opinion, it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
English: How much did you receive, for example, as an additional amount (who is an employee)?
This year, they added 2% to my gross salary, which is a mockery, but fortunately, I have a similar income from the business that I run alongside my employment.
English: Would someone be able to explain to me why proven convicted criminals are sent behind bars for maybe just 6 months?
English: I just can't wrap my head around this, how can a court send such an animal to jail for only 6 months just for them to do it again as soon as they get out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, negatively affecting their sexual relationships and relationships in general.
And not to mention that the rape victim may never recover from it either.
Doesn't this also discourage potential future reporting of rape by victims?
Man from Hrob "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlaty
English: The man from Hrob accidentally helped the guards secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom there was an arrest warrant.
English: He himself called her over, after all.
He went there, but took a detour.
First, he approached a passer-by and made up a story that he had been robbed.
English: The guards arrived at the location after being called on the emergency line and were surprised when the alleged "robbed" person informed them that he had made everything up, just to get the guards to come to the place.
In fact, he just wanted to ask the guards for advice on how to report an incident to the Czech Republic Police.
During an identity check of the man and his girlfriend, the guards found out that the woman is on the list of wanted persons, in a nationwide search, and there is an arrest warrant issued for her.
English: Therefore, the case is being handled by the Czech Police (PČR).
Sincere question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we Slavs have not been ethnically or culturally for a long time, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with the meme, of course. It's a shame that Churchill couldn't arrange the liberation of Prague by the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can truly believe in something completely without evidence just because it could potentially bring benefits.
In such a case, I personally would not consider it a true belief.
Here, I cannot agree with Pascal, as there are, if I am not mistaken, an estimated ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should a person choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of those thousands of religions, there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in a different god.
However, even in the Ten Commandments it is stated that there is no other god but Yahweh.
English: In such a case, wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god, rather than risking that out of those thousands of gods, I choose the wrong one, and the one true god, whom I didn't find, would send me to hell or some similar place for that?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in the reserves.
The Swiss model is, I believe, similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months for each one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
English: If a person performs well, they can get a professional offer.
All components of the ACR would find something like this useful.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defense.
We can talk like this: Cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being discussed, companies are recruiting in schools, and there is some kind of blending, where the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment relationships.
Not only during adolescence, but this process continues constantly, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Similar integration should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I perceive this also as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, German, or even a Mongolian invader will never invade here again.
It seems funny to me how you consider NATO to be something carved in stone; we have allies, and they will defend us if trouble arises.
Well, please the gentleman.
English: Just one election in the USA that tightens their budget and the whole NATO goes to hell.
English: The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown once that it's enough to show them our backs and they will take what they want.
The only thing that works in the long term as a guarantor of independence is an army armed to the teeth and a population that knows how to operate the military technology of their time.
And today, every teenager can pilot remotely controlled vehicles, so why wouldn't it be possible.
We don't need border fortifications, that's useless nowadays, but a nimble teenager with a remote control device will manage.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Unwrap the gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are at home overwhelmed with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is reused by e-shops, which lack packaging materials.
A map of stores was created, which will welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
That's why it's a shame to treat them like disposable waste.
English: Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains nearly 150 of them) after agreement.
By doing so, it will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated, and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
English: The stores themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply in the market, as well as the money saved since the price of the packaging cardboard has increased by 50% recently.
In the eyes of ecologically-minded customers, I am also strengthening my brand.
One of such businesses is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-friendly household cleaning products and cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are brought to us in Popůvky near Brna by individuals who accumulate them at home. However, we also hear from companies with which we have arranged regular pickups of discarded cardboard.
We will use everything for packing shipments from our e-shop.
English: Thanks to individuals and companies, we are creating a more considerate world together.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauties of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
English: However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only collection points for packaging materials.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted waste from households, where to hand in expired medicines, tires, used electronics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All waste can thus end up in the right place, and reusable items can find their second home.
English: In total, the project map contains over 100,000 such places.
"Gradually, more collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs, and other places are being added, which help find uses for things that would otherwise unnecessarily become waste," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliďme Česko association.
It seems rather unfortunate to me that in today's age, technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or phone to play games on them do not learn basic computer skills in the process.
Recently, a problem has emerged (mainly in English articles) that college students do not understand the principle of folders on computers.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple photo applications or actually mobile phones in general simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and put everything on a single screen in the app.
Feel free to use technology from childhood, but mainly learn something.
English: Let's rewrite history, seriously
English: Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU over the weekend - starting in January - and it was grand.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he revealed the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the streets – and mentioned so many actions that they cannot be accomplished in half a year.
French politicians like it that way and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters, straddling between the right and the left, agree on very little, but they do agree on Europe.
And in France, there will be new presidential elections in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader, among other things, mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is prepared to create conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators rushed to criticize, saying that Macron is promoting pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying more to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is currently touring France with the argument that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is having quite a success with the French people.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of having one history textbook seriously and not focus on what's happening in France.
English: Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story of us versus them and never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, French, Czechs find out who beat whom in which battle.
However, if they don't have an enlightened teacher, they won't find out the broader context of the event.
The movie of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
English: Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the Srebrenica massacre in 1995, also won awards for best director and best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, it held onto the top spots of the audience rankings.
In Berlin, Anthony Hopkins became the best actor for the movie The Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
English: It was approximately like "having the flu/being congested." I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't feel like smoking much...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
English: I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I don't claim that everyone has it like this)

Prosaic texts that follow the previous similar collection by Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another serving of observations of the world and descriptions of everyday things with extraordinary poetic attentiveness, depth, and atmosphere.
In his second prose, photographer Šesták attempted to capture the essence of a small town as well as Czech society.
Narrative about returning to one's roots, which turns out to be just a desired illusion.
The Bohemist and comparatist transfers the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood into the setting of a contemporary village.

In his penultimate novel, the author tells a much less sentimental story about returning from emigration than we are used to listening to.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to have a life together.
Trains start running according to the new schedule; in some places, the carriers will change.
English: Starting Sunday, trains on the railway will operate according to a new timetable.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some routes, for example, between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts to operate instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, and possibly their route slightly as well.
On the tracks, there will also be dozens of new trains.
English: The transport operators started selling tickets already during the fall.
Czech Railways plans to operate an average of 6,783 passenger transport connections daily in the new timetable, of which an average of 478 long-distance trains will be operated daily.
During the new timetable, trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers.
English: In addition to domestic routes, the new timetable will also include routes to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, and Switzerland.
The company, along with the new timetable, will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will operate on routes from Prague to Cheb.
English: The carrier will dispatch more new trains in Northern Moravia or Western Bohemia.
From next year, the carrier will also traditionally increase the fare prices, on average by 3.2 percent.
The railways take inflation into account in their tariffs annually.
The biggest change in RegioJet's timetable is the entry to the R23 line Ústí nad Labem - Mělník - Nymburk - Kolín.
The carrier will replace Czech Railways here after success in the Ministry of Transport competition.
English: RegioJet will operate a total of 16 connections on the route daily, eight in each direction.
English: Further changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou, and Kolín stations.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia, and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to the spokesperson Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to maintain as similar as possible travel times for its long-distance trains, even despite the planned track closures.
English: The operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should also continue without major changes.
The carrier will also be replaced on some regional lines.
Changes are awaiting passengers, for example in the Česká Lípa region, where on the route from Mladá Boleslav through Česká Lípa to Rumburk, Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will operate instead of Czech Railways.
English: Passengers will also be able to use a uniform fare on the railway for the second year.
Just like with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I must disagree.
Are we not learning to see the other side's perspective?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work hard, they died.
In my life, I have never heard teachings from the perspective of the slave-owning side or from that time, nobody defends this, only condemns it.
No one even tells you in schools that black people were often sold into slavery by other black people and that they were often the worst slave traders.
English: Nobody in school will teach you that colonizers often bought land from the Indians; everywhere they just tell you how brutally we, Europeans, exterminated them, even though they had been killing each other long before.
For some time, I also spent time in the USA, directly at schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern ones.
English: I have not encountered anyone deliberately concealing facts, but I have heard before that it happens and, in my opinion, it is a problem, I do not deny that (for example, the atrocities of WW2 are quite taboo in Japan).
My point was rather that history is not black and white, and we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History is not interested in someone's feelings, it simply is what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at the matter from the perspective of that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, speaking of those southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and famous slave owners are quite popular there, but on the other hand, they also had some of their own successes and it seemed absurd to me to condemn them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people idealize it today.
And many people also forget that not everyone in the South were slave owners and a lot of things were also against their will.
English: I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie, and manipulate, and moreover, our point of view doesn't exist for them (there was even a video on YT from a TV where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found funny about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
Overall, it seemed to me that at some universities it was terrible, those students were quite radicalized and the schools often supported them in this.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, it makes me feel a bit sick that this could be the majority voice, because it exists among the youth and even within the ruling elite.
It seems to me that, for example, feminism has long since achieved what it was supposed to, and it's no longer about the same thing; it has become radicalized.
Currently, those who have nothing in common with feminism and ignore basic biological facts are identifying themselves as feminists, as well as other groups like LGBT, which leads to radicalization on the opposite side, often leading to resistance even in quite reasonable matters.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they can be heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I have also never encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
English: Rather, I came across bad geography, but it was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't achieve myself?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality overall to be unnecessary in terms of any personal identity.
English: If anything connects me with people, it's common interests, worldviews, and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
That Slovak priest is a terribly nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always messes up with some nonsense about the coronavirus, that everyone gets embarrassed.
English: Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially, they are Protestants, but in reality, they originated from Catholic modernism and are essentially Catholics without a Pope.
I know many people who are Catholics, but attend services with the Hussites because it is very similar theologically, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
English: Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans, and they even hold a mass in Latin there every Sunday at 15:00, as it was done before Vatican II.
The Flame of Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts received it from Austria
Břeclav - The flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
English: Scouts did not go to Vienna for it even this time due to the coronavirus pandemic, they took it from their Austrian colleagues in the morning at the Reintal - Břeclav border crossing.
At the border, they took it over last year as well.
English: The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in with the group every year, I am really looking forward to it.
It is an honor for me to have been chosen, said scout Amálie Budíková to the present journalists.
English: While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now it is happening at the Reintal – Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
English: Scouts usually travel to Vienna by train for him.
There are no changes in the distribution of the flame throughout the Czech Republic.
With the Bethlehem light, the scouts traditionally set out by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday, December 18th, scout couriers will take care of the subsequent distribution of light, traveling through selected express and local trains.
From them, local scouts or volunteers at the stations will take over the light, who will then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic and to places where the tracks do not lead.
This year, scouts must also adhere to the valid measures against the spread of coronavirus.
It is happening similar to last year.
We give recommendations to both courier teams and local event organizers to, of course, wear masks, try to maintain distancing, have as few people as possible, not sing to colleagues, and simply behave in such a way as to make it as safe as possible, described the spokeswoman of the Bethlehem Light event, Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light, which travels across Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship, and harmony along with the flame.
Bethlehem's light is a symbol of hope, light overcoming darkness, for believers.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and girl scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event relies on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human solidarity.
All the latest updates, including a list of places where people can come for the Bethlehem Light, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the fundamentals of economics that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
Development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare, and education will make proper use of the money. I just don't understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry, and companies in general.
As mentioned - an unnecessary product is being produced, and it disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work in a factory myself, where there are a million signs in the corridors saying "xy financed/co-financed by project xy," and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
English: This is not support for a company that provides jobs for x people, this is hindering development when this company is barely holding on and taking orders/employees from other companies, which could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Absolute agreement, it's terrible.
Occasionally, even a person who was born in the Internet age can also fall for some trick or trap - especially advertisements.
I think to myself that internet ads don't affect me, but then I catch myself being influenced by them anyway - it's just so sophisticated now that a person can't always resist it.
And for that reason, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament, who currently want to impose an absolute ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertisements...
It's all nonsense, in the words of a classic - I would ban those internets.
English: I have a feeling that this belief has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe in something that most people believe in and makes sense, I am not a sheep, but I would rather believe in something that is less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion which I will claim is critical thinking."
English: 2. "I won't believe everything the media says, after all."
English: 3. "I don't trust politicians"
Televisions have succumbed to the trend of Christmas movies, with two hundred of them premiering this year.
Los Angeles - Cinemas, television stations, and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have succumbed to the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will premiere a record-breaking more than two hundred of them to their viewers.
The operator of the IMDb film database has calculated it.
Genre of Christmas family and romantic movies has been scoring with the audience in recent years and significantly increasing viewership, which is why more and more of these films are being made.
This year, four times more Christmas movies were filmed than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
English: The IMDb database, meanwhile, included in its total only those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so there will actually be many more holiday films.
Movies, which people traditionally associate with Christmas, have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is mainly associated with fairy tales, while globally popular films include Home Alone, Love Actually, and the classic Christmas story It's a Wonderful Life from 1946.
English: The real boom of Christmas movies, however, began in 2009 when the American cable television channel Hallmark introduced a special film series, as BBC's website reminded us.
Her Advent project called Countdown to Christmas (Odpočítávání do Vánoc) at that time included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station began tuning its viewers for Christmas on October 22nd and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Competitive station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its program this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the total sum.
English: "In this magical period, the story doesn't matter that much, the important thing is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray described this genre with exaggeration, the author of the book about Christmas films titled I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies).
"For viewers, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a bit of calm for at least two hours amidst all the holiday madness and the madness of the world in which we have been living for the last couple of years," added Gray.
According to him, for example, Hallmark television uses the same formula for its films which is uniform, but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then about half an hour before the end, some misunderstanding arises, which, however, is successfully resolved and the two of them kiss.
This is how it goes round and round, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after another, adds Gray.
Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19, will not participate in the final F1 race.
English: Only nineteen drivers will head to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for covid-19 and will not participate in the last race of the season.
Haas Stable will send only one formula car on the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better position from the 20th place, which he achieved in the qualification.
Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team, however, will ultimately not participate in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He was indeed tested positive for COVID-19.
On the starting grid, only nineteen cars will appear. Starting from the last position, Nikita Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher will take to the track, while Max Verstappen, who will be battling for the title with Lewis Hamilton, will start from the first position.
English: According to Haas team statements, Mazepin is relatively fine and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
Now in isolation, she will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all parties involved," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not send a substitute driver to the race, nor can they.
A possible substitute would therefore have to complete the qualification or drive in another part of the weekend.
With Covid-19, the first racer is not struggling.
At the start of the just-ending season, Kimi Räikkönen had COVID-19, last year Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
For this, they can also lock you up.
And everyone will not care that the boss said.
From the perspective of the law, Covid is on the list of infectious diseases.
So, in the same group as HIV, plague, hepatitis, or typhus.
English: § 152 Spread of contagious human disease
English: (1) Whoever intentionally causes or increases the risk of introduction or spread of an infectious disease among humans will be punished with imprisonment for six months to three years, prohibition of activity or forfeiture of property.
(2) The offender will be punished by imprisonment for two to eight years.
c) if by such an act he/she violates an important obligation arising from his/her employment, profession, position or function, or imposed on him/her by law, or
English: d) if such an act causes serious harm to health.
(3) The offender will be punished with deprivation of liberty for three to ten years, should the act referred to in paragraph 1 cause serious harm to the health of at least two persons or death.
English: (4) The perpetrator shall be punished with imprisonment for five to twelve years if he/she causes the death of at least two persons by the act specified in paragraph 1.

Gold, silver, and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put half a year of work and all their savings into it.
English: "I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience since we didn't wear sweaters much at home," admits Liban, who spent 3000 hours working on his project in half a year.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France, and the company Swarovski supplied 2,000 decorative crystals.
English: The silver stars were then decorated with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk adds softness to the sweater," praises the creator of his work, which, however, he does not recommend washing.
And there's one more catch.
"I am completely broke, I need to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold so far, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.
If the Ministry of Health is detached from reality, it doesn't matter too much - it allows the defective circuit to fly off and be replaced with a new one.
English: The fact is that the departure of FB from Europe would greatly help its non-Russian part (the one under influence is out of luck).
I think it would clear up the social climate quite a bit.
Potentially, the channels of "Soviet brotherly assistance" to some of our political parties and representatives would also be better clarified.
Then people who vote for them would also know more clearly whose interests they are actually pursuing.
It's a shame they don't own TikTok as well.

About the situation in the USA with a leading African American reporter.
In the United States, new cases of police violence are emerging, this time during interventions at nationwide protests.
English: The demonstrations that erupted after the killing of African American George Floyd by a police officer during an arrest opened a debate on systematic racism, the role of the police, and cases of brutality against American minorities.
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with one of the leading African-American journalists, reporter for The Atlantic magazine Adam Serwer.
But what would increase that funding?
Union pushes money into us through subsidies.
English: If it stops doing that, we'll stop having that money.
English: I really don't see how the fact that the union stops giving us money would cause us to use that money for something else...
You can argue that the money from those subsidies could be used better, but that's a completely different discussion.

The government approved sending up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Bridegrooms, scouts, and drone pilots could set off before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to help their Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
English: Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO countries in connection with the ongoing actions of the Belarusian regime, which has been inviting citizens from the Middle Eastern countries to its territory with false promises of easy crossing of the European Union border for several months.
In Polish territory, British and Estonian soldiers are already operating.
English: Is the Omicron mutation spreading in South Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
English: "Currently, we have reported another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class."
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov Elementary School has not been proven," said Ciupek.
English: Six cases appeared in the region during the week.
"Official confirmation of the variant in our six cases is still being awaited – it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," the director stated.
She added that it involves two nurses from one workplace at the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old students from ZŠ Adamov.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms according to the director, four are asymptomatic.
No one with suspicion of Omicron traveled abroad
None of the mentioned traveled abroad, nor did anyone from their families, nor did they come into contact with anyone who stayed abroad.
The connection with the water polo championship is not relevant to any of the mentioned individuals, said Ciupek.
Chief Hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously stated that an international water polo tournament, which took place in Brno a few weeks ago, is being investigated.
On it, there were also players from the South African Republic and one Belgian player fell ill after returning.
California restricts the sale of weapons.
Wants to proceed like Texas in banning abortions.
English: California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a plan on Saturday to introduce a ban on the sales and production of certain weapons in the most populous American state, using the legal mechanism that Texas employed in its controversial law against abortions performed after the detection of the embryo's heartbeat.
English: People should then be entitled to compensation when suing anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
English: Newsom's announcement reacted to Friday's position of the US Supreme Court, which left the Texas abortion ban in force, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict, which established the right to abortion across the entire USA up to about the 24th month of pregnancy.
The court, however, did not decide on the constitutionality of the entire law, but rather on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public, thereby preventing Texas Republicans from challenging it through the usual judicial process.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) decision of the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the preservation of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," said the California governor.
"If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He reportedly instructed his subordinates to cooperate with the state parliament and the Minister of Justice to work on measures that would authorize representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
These are homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand compensation of at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) and legal expenses from anyone who manufactures, distributes, or sells assault rifles, components for "ghost guns," or kits for their production in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that is precisely what we should do," said the California governor.
English: The AP agency points out that for decades California has banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons, but in June a federal judge blocked the local ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually reinstate the ban now, using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in her dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict warned against the spread of the legal mechanism to other American states.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant complete immunity to the Texas abortion ban against judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue lawsuits against selected officials of the southern US state.
Every emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, during which the vaccination schedule is gradually being determined, and improvements to the vaccines themselves are made based on the results.
From Israel, numerous studies are already rolling out about the effects of the 4th dose.
And according to these studies, the majority of patients experience up to a fivefold increase in antibodies, which already has the mentioned long-term effect.
Simply, like any other vaccination, it will have its vaccination schedule over time, but it's just too early for that now.
English: Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, should be coming to the market soon, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10x greater effectiveness.
English: Feel free to leave the amount of material.
But reconsider WHAT is being learned.
Since the times of Maria Theresa, our civilization and technology has advanced a bit and learning phone directories and copying textbooks into notebooks no longer makes much sense and is really a waste of time.
In these matters, it would be possible to cut back brutally.
On the other hand, how many people leave elementary school with some basic financial literacy?
And what other things will be necessary for life?
How can I legally watch the Champions League online?
Do you know if there is any online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to watch the Champions League for a fee?
At home, we have Netbox and I pay for the Telly sports package for the Spanish and English football leagues.
However, that does not include the UEFA Champions League.
I think O2 offers the Champions League, but I don't want to change my television and internet provider.
Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would be acting in violation of the law if it used its new powers and stopped payment of funds to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan regarding the disbursement of 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
A is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use the mechanism allowing the withdrawal of EU subsidies from countries violating the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU by using its veto in all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, the leader of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable given that the EU is unlawfully denying us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, added the Polish minister.
His party takes a more radical stance towards the EU than the ruling party Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary has undergone during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobra, sets "impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw is facing a "political dictate carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of such an EU that is based on the partnership of sovereign states, and not on the rule of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never agree to such concessions from Brussels, as a result of which the sovereignty of Poland would be limited.
" We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony," he declared.
But figuring it out... In our Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look at the other things, I came across one yogurt several times as well, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves, I gave up and asked.
They had it, that's true, in that narrow section there were all the selected, less common, and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
English: If possible, I won't even set foot in any supermarket, whether there's a sale or not. Instead, I prefer the golden shop on the square. They might not have such a wide selection, but they usually have absolutely everything I need, and it's well-organized, so I'm done in ten minutes.
English: To Lidl so I can take a vacation.
And I really don't care anymore.
For two years, I have been watching how data is treated here like manure. Most opponents of vaccination are just slightly more off-target than most proponents of vaccination.
Rational discussion is indeed taking place at a professional level, but only extreme opinions are reaching public space.
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Prohibit everything, allow everything.
Colorful pies instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples to pears.
English: This state has it like this and we have it like this.
English: But the fact that the data collection methodology is different in those two states is not addressed by anyone.
Phew, I feel relieved now.
English: Sorry for the outburst and I wish a nice day to all of you.
In my childhood, I was punished with a cooking spoon.
It was never about the grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and misbehaved (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I have never been punished without a warning; mom always threatened first, saying that if I did it one more time, I would get hit (sometimes even after catching me again, she would just bring a spatula and place it so I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I receive a few spanks on my buttocks (over my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and measure) are beneficial, because the child responds to them much more than to words.
In my opinion, the important part is the warning part because it gives the child a choice in a way whether to disobey and get punished, or to improve and avoid the punishment.
In the end, usually just a warning was enough for me to start listening.
System defense
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution meant to him - whether it was a sacred document that one swears by and learns about from an early age in school, or on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he definitely leaned towards the first concept.
Once in the institute, we agreed on the democratic rules of our life, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to be cautious with changes.
And imagine this: some nations even like their own rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl voted on the issue at that time.
Recently, however, the opinion that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes has been increasingly appearing among lawyers.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not predict, such as the behavior of a directly-elected president.
In one thing, however, Cepl was right.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be well thought out.
The institution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to coping with most crises that societies encounter throughout history.
The constitution is, among other things, a kind of governing order consisting of individual rules that set the boundaries of the game for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be misused against minorities or individuals, so we tie up policies with prohibitions.
English: At the same time, however, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not discriminate, at Brno University Hospital they are fighting for the life of a several-month-old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus is generally milder in children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been grappling with, especially recently.
English: "We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, it is talked about 2 to 5 percent in comparison with adults," said the head of the Clinic of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation of the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, Petr Dominik, to Novinky.
The course is usually much simpler, easier, and often occurs without symptoms.
There are, however, child patients who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which we see especially in the recent period," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, it concerns dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
English: It takes place at the clinic for children's infectious diseases.
Really seriously ill children with coronavirus have only recently been in the ICU.
Children with post-COVID syndromes were continuously present in the department throughout the whole year, according to the doctor.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute COVID pneumonia, which means inflammation of the lungs that requires a stay on a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease affects not only adults but also adolescents and even infants only a few months old.
In hospitals, there are also children in serious condition due to coronavirus.
"At present, we have a child of several months old as well as an adolescent in our facility," said the head physician.
She is, however, pleased that there have been no child deaths recorded so far due to coronavirus in the children's hospital of University Hospital Brno.
According to available data, as of December 6th, there have been six deaths of children aged 0 to 14 years in the Czech Republic.
According to Dominik, in the children's hospital – not only in the coronavirus department – cooperation with a psychologist is an integral part.
At the same time, it also points out the fact that, just as in adults, vaccination in children alleviates the course of the disease and simultaneously reduces the incidence of post-COVID syndrome.
"Therefore, we recommend the vaccination dose for children as well," added the doctor.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk along the marked paths.
But those quiet zones are not that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map at mapy.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the quiet zone, you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the game reserve).
Skiing/cycling in the forest off marked paths is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course, it is not monitored that much outside of national parks).
English: How does a conductor train?
Music is playing in my head, Josef Kurfiřt laughs.
He was nurtured by the Liberec opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer, he can perform virtually the entire repertoire, and as a conductor, he works not only at the F. Šaldy Theater in Liberec but also, for example, in Pilsen, at the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theater.
English: Collaborates with the Hradec Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic, or the Podkrkonoší Symphony Orchestra.
China is creating the impression of a managed infection and that the authoritarian regime is coping better with the crisis.
Sinologist Jirouš: China is creating the impression of managing the infection and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has launched a healthcare and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing faced criticism for failing to stop the infection, which turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero increase in infections.
States, including the Czech Republic, compete for Chinese protective equipment and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus in many places, such as in the worst-hit Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it about friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets another friend and asks him: hey, do you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
The wife is happy because she saves the grass, washes the car with a trunk, and the children play with him.
English: Well, simply great.
If you want, I will sell you the elephant for 5,000.
Friend: Alright, let's high five, it's going to be awesome...
After some time they meet, and the one who bought it complains: dude, what kind of elephant did you sell????
English: The lawn is trampled, giant poop everywhere, the car is broken down, the children are afraid of it, and the wife wants to get a divorce.
The one who sold it says: you speak unpleasantly about the elephant, you won't sell an elephant like that...
English: World events are controlled by major powers.
Despite the equality of sovereign states, it is the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can become such a great power only if it works on its integration.
So far, it operates at the economic and political level (in selected issues), but military integration is still missing.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15, or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century the moods will be different and it will work out.
That occurred to me as well and it's quite possible.
I am not an expert in Czech, so I might be nitpicking words.
English: I am just assuming that an ellipse usually consists of 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment, "Spanish oranges and tangerines", where it is clear that both are from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and tangerines", it is not clear whether the tangerines are from Spain.
In addition, I base this on the fact that the sentence says "all American forces," including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in that broad concept and there is no need to further specify it for American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just nitpicking :D
Whether it is this way or that way, it is a nonsensical requirement.

Vicki Holland from the United Kingdom tortured the tamarin monkey Milly
Terrifying footage shows the moment when a frightened monkey crouched in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it away and laughed at it.
Hollandová also fed the monkey sausages, kebab, and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The Municipal Court in Gwent has now banned her from keeping animals for life, according to the newspaper The Sun.
Experts in rehabilitation of monkeys, who have been taking care of Milly after her abuse, stated that they have never seen such a frightened primate before.
English: Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation with the staff at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing again with another rescued monkey named Moon.
English: The mother of four admitted to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the Magistrate's Court in Gwent, she was given a twelve-week sentence of imprisonment with a conditional deferral for one year.
Hollandová was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a lifetime ban on keeping animals, and must pay the equivalent of 12,000 crowns in court costs.
Team leader of Small Monkeys, who rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyerová, said: "Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue further."
English: It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid from everyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The little monkey refused to eat for a long time.
And now, even though she has settled down and is satisfied with the male, the sight of new people can still cause her panic.
Psychological scars from the abuse will haunt her forever, adds Sawyerová.
The abuse of Milly was revealed after police in Gwent discovered horrifying footage on the woman's phone during a raid in her apartment due to drug charges.
In the footage, you can hear Milly swearing vulgarly.
In the next video, you can hear Holland offering cocaine to the monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
English: So lick my fingers.
In May, together with her partner Russell Cox (43), she admitted to possessing cocaine with the intention to sell it.
In her house, cocaine worth 1600 pounds (almost 50 thousand Czech crowns) was found hidden in Kinder eggs.
English: Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months, and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that prehistoric era three times in a row when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
So in the first grade, you'll get the same things as in the sixth grade?
And the whole thing kills the idea of cramming, when nobody, with honorable exceptions, cares whether you know it or understand it.
Mainly write a test for 1 and then no one is interested anymore.
English: Go and randomly ask people on the street if they can determine the character of roots of a quadratic equation and its coefficients.
English: Everyone has been through this, and the absolute majority don't even care and will tell you they don't give a damn.
So what the hell are we learning this for?
I am a big fan of general knowledge and the fact is that people do not want and do not need it.
And at that moment it is pointless, and you will never get it into them anyway.
English: It is partly learned for the many people who will need that particular thing.
But seriously, I meant the remark that you really don't need all this while standing at the machine... ...because you simply don't need it.
English: Moreover, we are slowly getting to the time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(Which is probably influenced by our communist past and the persecution of intellectuals and elites in our country) However, the price of having barbarians operate those machines for us is simply high.
If journalists could count, for example, the covid probably would have never reached these dimensions here.
Wedding at First Sight: The war between Kadri and Andrey continues!
English: "That is the main reason why Switzerland cannot be left immediately," Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to the curious questions from fans, wondering what was so disappointing about Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
Between Kadrim and Andrea, there was friction from the very beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea would move there for him, at least until he returns to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused that.
And as it can be seen, their relationship not only did not end with love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! Kadri was upset in response to Andreina's accusation of lies, gambling, and debts.
The alleged sincerity of Kadri's now ex-wife was not liked even by his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly support her brother.
Normally, I do not comment on such things at all, and even in the family, we never really talked about these things much.
I definitely do not want to evoke any pity.
When I see someone trying to publicly harm and tarnish the name of someone I care so much about, I just can't help it!
I am sorry that I have to do this this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it the most, even though he was at such a young age.
The more it upsets me when I have to read such untrue information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I would really wish for everyone to know Kadri as well as I, our close ones and family do, she says in a statement in response to Andrey's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the reality and understand what really happened, she added uncertainly.
A drunk thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what it's because of.
Cchao began his robbery spree in a residential area parking lot, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, in the end, he stole the equivalent of just under 330 crowns from one vehicle.
After that, he couldn't think of anything better than to climb up to the 5th floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
In the footage from one security camera, it captures him walking down the street away from the scene of the crime while eating a banana.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
English: Cchaa subsequently detained them.
English: The man admitted that on the incriminated day he drank some alcohol.
And considering that he needed money, he decided to rob in a drunken state.
English: The whole matter is currently under investigation.
The drunkard climbed the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
English: The pandemic law is time-limited and its effectiveness is tied to the pandemic alert.
When it is canceled, the law will not be effective.
English: The law indeed limits the scope of business
Isn't that reason enough for you?
The right to assemble will be limited, but not abolished.
For Saturday's elections to the representative councils of four municipalities, over 60 percent of voters turned out.
English: On Saturday, people elected new municipal councils in the villages of Komňa in Uherské Hradiště District, Lužice in Most District, Nová Ves in Liberec District, and Rovné in Pelhřimov District.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has dropped below the number set by law, or the elected councils have disintegrated.
On Saturday, 99 candidates competed for a total of 28 seats.
The average age of newly elected councilors is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a relatively demanding, but successful year for us.
In total, four new or repeated elections to municipal councils took place, and primarily the closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said the Vice-Chairwoman of the Czech Statistical Office, Eva Krumpová.
She reminded that due to the Covid-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security.
In Komna, in the Uherské Hradiště district, the Association of Independent Candidates won the Saturday elections, receiving 27.76 percent of the votes and obtaining two seats in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means a gain of two mandates.
Two seats in the assembly were also obtained by Citizens for Komňa, 18.52 percent of voters gave them their vote.
Again, the current mayor of the municipality Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Soukromníků, was elected to the municipal council.
English: Komňané – independent candidates, achieved one term in the assembly.
English: 75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimov region, the association Pro Rovnou won.
It received 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four seats out of seven.
English: Two more representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 got into the municipal council.
Election participation was 93.62 percent.
English: In the repeated elections in Lužice in the Most region, the Association of Lužice and Svinčice, led by Mayor Jindřich John, won again.
It received 56.73 percent of the votes, and just like in 2018, it has four mandates in the seven-member council.
The second place was taken by the candidate from the "Municipality for the People" party, who received 43.27 percent of the votes, thus having three representatives in the council.
English: 76.7 percent of the voters came to the ballot boxes.
Elections in Nova Ves in the Liberec region were won by independent candidates Hope for Nova Ves ahead of the ANO Movement.
For the association of independent candidates, 59.88 percent of voters voted and thus they gained four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
English: ANO received 40.12 percent of the votes and strengthened against regular elections in 2018, gained one more mandate and has three.
Election turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
On Monday, the State Electoral Commission will discuss the election results.
English: Subsequently, they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you already know all these things that people are writing here.
You're just playing the fool so you have someone to "argue" with.
If not, then it's sad.
I am not saying that Christians are degenerates, nor anything like that.
Even many church buildings appeal to me from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal for them to look good).
And it doesn't really matter to me who believes in what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it amassed, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it caused, for example, the Thirty Years War
Tl;dr: Believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster if you want, but the state and the church should not be together
A man fell headfirst from a height of twelve meters.
He survived the impact with concrete.
English: An incredible fall was survived by a man in Ostrava on Sunday night, with regional Emergency Medical Services rescuers intervening on his behalf.
English: Workers of the regional operational center received an emergency call one hour after midnight on Saturday, with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two EMS crews – medical and paramedical – were dispatched to the scene immediately.
Upon arrival at the scene, paramedics found that the twenty-seven-year-old man had fallen from a window from a height of about twelve meters and landed head-first on concrete!
In Vítkovice, the coal caught fire.
But not as it should, and the firefighters went into action.
At the moment of the arrival of the rescue service teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger to his life.
English: The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial ventilation, and after further measures as part of out-of-hospital emergency care, an ambulance transported him to the care of Ostrava's trauma center, according to the spokesperson of the Emergency Medical Services of the Moravian-Silesian Region, Lukáš Humpl.
I have greater concerns about the inadequate reactions of the public and authorities than about the coronavirus.
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic poses a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and healthcare staff are primarily on the front line in the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?
We ask military doctor David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunesová falls after seven years, Oliveira defends belt
MMA experienced a fabulous gala evening full of interesting results.
English: At the UFC 269 tournament, things were happening indeed.
Outsider Julianna Peňová managed to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunesová, who had not found a conqueror for seven whole years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in the lightweight division, demonstrated great choking against Dustin Poirier, and defended the belt.
Victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept Cody Garbrandt with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
Surprise that no one expected.
That brought the women's bantamweight fight between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American woman entered the mutual battle as a figurative "dwarf", since Nunes had not lost for seven years and was sharpening her teeth for another triumph.
The beginning of the duel was also in line with the expected paper assumptions.
Nunesová started her journey to victory very actively and even dealt a push kick to her opponent, which sent her to the ground.
However, Peňová did not let herself be forced into any further mistake, and she unsuccessfully attempted to attack using a lever on the arm.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents treated each other with a lot of excellent strikes and hard hooks.
English: Peňová also got Nunesová on the ground, where she began to choke her.
She had to give up the effort and shake off the attack.
The American woman thus prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
English: Initially, Poirier was doing better, but the tide gradually began to turn.
In the second round, Oliveira tried to be more active, attempting to defeat his opponent with an arm lock.
Although he didn't succeed too much at first, he then created great pressure, got his opponent on his back, and overwhelmed him with a series of strikes.
English: Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to tap out from the choke.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost for the first time in two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley scored a dominant victory, applying a hard right rear in the first round to Raulian Paiva.
Subsequently, he defeated him with a series of accurately aimed blows and recorded his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to handle Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter; now, after seven years, she has lost.
English: That thigh, or this thigh?
At first glance, it's not complicated.
English: In Czech, most nouns express only one grammatical gender, so there is no problem determining whether they are masculine, feminine, or neuter.
English: However, there is also a relatively large group of nouns where the gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
During declension, they acquire double endings and in some cases remain in the indeclinable form.
For example, the words "svízel" and "kyčel" belong to both the masculine and feminine genders; the first is declined according to the pattern of "stroj" and the second according to the pattern of "píseň."
In the next group of nouns, there are different forms already in the first case of the singular, for example: "řádek/řádka" (line/line), "kedluben/kedlubna" (kohlrabi/kohlrabi) or "brambor/brambora" (potato/potato) (in the sense of food).
Both forms are literary, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, for example "okurka" in the Czech Republic and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-standard, similarly other Czech-Moravian word pairs are in the same situation: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih" etc.
English: Some words that entered Czech from other languages were originally indeclinable, but gradually they adopt Czech endings.
English: A typical example is the term "image", which is of both masculine and feminine gender, or the word "bufet", which has remained non-declinable in the neuter gender, but in the masculine it has endings according to the "hrad" pattern.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
English: What does the situation look like directly at the Greek borders?
On the Greek-Turkish border, there is tension due to the increasing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to head towards the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them from doing so.
European politicians promise support for Greece, humanitarian aid is also being prepared by the Czech government.
What actually motivates refugees to take the uncertain journey?
And what does the situation look like on site?
For three months we haven't seen the blue sky and we've been choking, describes a journalist from Sydney.
Destructive fires, which Australia has been grappling with for the fourth month, have killed nearly thirty people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the residents themselves coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic impacts, as critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in connection with climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with a journalist from Sydney, Ika Detrichová.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everything is always written about everyone everywhere.
For people, it is unpleasant to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how terribly widespread it is, so they try to downplay it.
I don't personally know anyone who has been falsely accused.
I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have experienced how their environment and even the police often treat these people.
Victims should always be believed.
The trend has become that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
English: Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are also those who falsely accuse someone.
It is disgusting and a spit in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the accusations are made up" and that it is a "trend", you are only helping sexual assailants.
Czech Republic is flooded with unfinished houses, families do not have money to complete them
English: The prices of construction materials have increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A number of people got into a difficult situation because of this.
She does not have the means to complete the unfinished family houses, and banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to the cost of materials, the price of construction work is also increasing.
People therefore do not have enough money to complete the already started family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In a better case, people move into unfinished and unapproved houses.
In the worst case, unfinished houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and rent at the same time," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
English: In a year, we will build two to three family houses and it happened to us with fifty percent.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to comply with some contractual things, even though the material has become more expensive.
So we're working without profit," said Zdeněk Slivoň, the owner of the construction company.
Many people will only start having financial problems.
If they estimated that building the house would cost five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some people will wait," added Slivoň.
From the materials, the most expensive were copper, iron, and also plumbing and heating equipment.
English: Construction companies are also struggling with a shortage of labor.
In the Czech Republic, there is a shortage of graduates in construction fields and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by the pandemic.
At this moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of building permits is more favorable.
In October, building authorities issued 7,675 building permits, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," specified Křeček.
We are doing well and we will be doing even better.
Real vision is missing, says ČRO commentator - mujRozhlas
Entering the new year, in addition to classic celebrations, was traditionally accompanied by speeches from politicians.
English: This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and ANO leader Andrej Babis and the Christmas message of President Milos Zeman, the chairs of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What crucial information have we learned?
As for that, I find the thesis really great because I have my own topic that I chose, building on my bachelor's degree, always working on it throughout the year, and then within a week or two, I write the written part.
The state exams here are completely relaxed, as long as a person is not a total fool and still has something in their head, the committee will not unnecessarily suffocate them with theory.
For example, I studied for my state exams for a week and when I was at a loss, the committee always tried to guide me towards some logical deduction, which immediately clicked for me and I got it right.
Otherwise, regarding those projects, I know people who pay someone to do their semester project for them (we have done it many times, really beneficial, learned a lot) and then they just learn the project and everything is taken care of.
In my opinion, it's great when there is an exam at the end of the subject that reflects the knowledge gained within the project, not just the defense.
Everything is okay, but don't overload with emails and phone calls and don't send any packages to the embassy.
English: You will be the same jerk as them.
Those people at the embassy may not have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would take a big risk, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But feel free to put a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe it needs to be given in such a way that it reaches Xi Jinping's backside or something like that.
I agree, even though Insta throws obstacles in the way for artists.
As soon as you don't post stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will be reduced to an absolute minimum.
Moreover, they keep changing which function is more important, whether it's a like, comment, or save.
Lately, it's been really bothering me, so I might have to stoop down to using TikTok, where many artists from my industry have great success and can't get enough of it.
In the end, I might even be glad if something more user-friendly came along, which doesn't drain all the creativity and energy from the artists.
Declaration of the Donetsk Working Party
Union - yes, breaking up - no, the opponents of the breakup of the USSR express their opinion in the photo.
Thirty years since the illegal breakup of the USSR.
On the eighth of December, 1991, the largest geopolitical catastrophe in human history took place.
In the Bialowieza Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk, and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the referendum results from March 17, 1991, and with the open indulgent attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard for the people, signed an agreement stating that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With one stroke of a pen, they "abolished" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
English: Since the beginning of the nineties, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
And regardless of the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
English: Even earlier, the same people who destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years in a single session in the Białowieża Forest betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
Consciously, they carried out deindustrialization, slowed down agriculture, and detached fourteen republics from the largest world power, which had previously been economically connected in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, military, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, NATO expansion to the east, war and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, war in Syria - all of this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, first abandoning the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
English: There is a concept in political science called "power vacuum."
Everything that was hastily betrayed and abandoned was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries, which accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken mainly due to the events from the late eighties and the beginning of the nineties of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a high-turnover supermarket may not directly correspond to its quality and value.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK/kg.
I will buy it with the intention of putting it in the fridge and making dinner out of it on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, where I do not buy the meat on Monday, the chain will reduce its price to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the change in the price of that meat becomes a burden for my digestive system?
And or I will wait until Thursday and that meat will be 1 day before the expiration date discounted to 69 CZK / kg - how would this meat be different from the one I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more expensive and left it for 3 days in my fridge?
English: I'll answer myself - with nothing.
English: These talks about how if something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or low quality are incredibly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Recently, I was walking in Brno at Hlavas and in the underpass, young ladies were handing out some brochures. I always take such things to help the part-time workers; they can't throw them away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but nothing about God, I was confused, but I suspected it would be some kind of propaganda.
After finishing reading, I found out who published it and eventually Scientology emerged from it.
Well, it was a good sailor, full of completely useless advice, like I should wash myself and not be a jerk.
English: A waste of paper, forests wouldn't have to be cut down because of this.
Something similar happened to me with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to please that person because you like them, without even realizing how messed up the situation is.
She threatened me several times that she would hurt herself because I went out to chat with a friend she didn't like.
English: Or also when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she started crying and begged me on her knees not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
English: For about a year, it was a great relationship, but then another half a year passed and she started to go crazy.
English: After that, I ended the relationship, telling her that we were breaking up and lied to her, but saying we can still talk about it next week to calm her down and prevent her from having another outburst.
Such a person drains you of feelings, emotions, and overall joy.
English: Preferably keep distance
English: When insurance companies are furiously embezzling by buying a bunch of tests and quickly identifying those who are positive, who would not even know about this terrible disease without the test.
The only thing we achieve is causing complications for companies, carriers, and others, due to the fact that their employees received five days of house arrest in the random number generator.
In the west, they have already stopped with that foolishness and recognized that it is not worth dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and still has to steal something and boost his ego by inventing nonsense.
English: I see that the good old junk is coming back to us again.
After several years of decline and suppression of this shady business, MLM recruiting is once again back in the spotlight.
English: I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman at university), initial promises about product training and business skills quickly turned into "you don't have to worry about that, just find people".
Honestly, I was interested in the products I was offering because I wanted to help people, but the trainings were more about how to scare and talk someone into it.
When the first earned money came, a person quickly realized that if they want to earn, they must produce several certain products monthly.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable things, so then a person felt like a door-to-door salesman of pots.
But what I can say, it was a valuable experience, one learned not to jump on everything right away and to thoroughly verify information.
At the same time, I wouldn't put everyone in the same bag.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to others, but they certainly won't boast about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" bank account.
In the corporation where I work, I have not experienced many such things.
HR is at peace, managers mind their own management, and they don't interfere too much in our affairs.
English: Regular evaluations are therefore happening in some way, and the form in which it takes place here is quite manageable (set some goals for the next year, we will look at what worked and what didn't in a year) - it is more of a self-assessment, rather than someone evaluating you based on some numbers or something like that.
English: Company events also not mandatory.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate."
Sometimes a person feels like we are almost a startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation, right?
But it works like this, so they don't bother us too much, as long as the results are there.
English: The Czech woman reported missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, the British police have been unsuccessfully searching for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12th, the resigning Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social media that a woman from Uherské Hradiště was found dead.
English: This afternoon, the British police unfortunately confirmed to our representative office in London that they found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
English: The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not be sharing more information about the case.
Sincere condolences, Kulhánek stated on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28th on a bus while traveling from work; before boarding, she was supposed to pick up money from an ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by her colleagues from work five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began searching for her, and Interpol listed her among the missing people worldwide.
She also appeared in the Czech missing persons database.
In this context, the police already detained one man several days ago.
English: What role was he supposed to play in the case and what is he suspected of, but has not been disclosed.
In four municipalities, new councils were established towards the end of the year.
On Saturday, December 11th, new municipal councils were elected in the villages of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region, and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the legally established number or the elected councils have disintegrated.
In the new elections, 99 valid candidates competed for 28 mandates.
Election turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest turnout was recorded in the municipality of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men received mandates.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
For the new elections to the representative bodies in the mentioned four municipalities, a total of 13 candidate lists were registered.
Out of 28 representative posts, 36 women and 63 men were competing.
English: The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest was 72 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a fairly demanding but successful year for us.
In it, four new or repeated elections to municipal councils took place, and above all, the closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
English: We mostly had to work under more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed higher demands on equipment and personnel security, assessed Eva Krumpová, the 1st Vice-Chairwoman of the Czech Statistical Office.
English: The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, December 12th at 03:49 hours.
English: On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the voting results, and after approval, they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
English: At first, it took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a fairly dangerous contagious disease here, but it went without any major complications.
English: Dealing with how idiotically a large part of the population at all its levels approaches this is a problem I still have.
I am looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) the most because thanks to it, I will finally be less dependent on other people not being jerks.
He would be stripped of the function of president and the ability to regain it.
The chance of that actually happening, however, is quite small, as others have mentioned here.
Moreover, I am not sure if the shredding of the file could even be considered treason.
High treason is such an act by which the president of the republic endangers the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic affected intimate life: The number of people up to 35 years old who are without sex for an entire year is increasing
More and more young adults in the USA are living their lives without sex.
It is mainly about religiously oriented people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who abstain from sexual activity increased from eight to 21 percent.
There are more women between 18 and 35 years old who reported not having sexual intercourse in the last year than ever before.
The decline in the number of sexually active individuals is also due to other factors, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One of them may be the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
The presence of media, social networks, and video games could also contribute to making sex a smaller and smaller priority for young people.
"Since 2010, there has been a rapid increase in the proportion of men and women between 18 and 35 years of age who report that they did not have sex in the previous year," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
In married people, sexual activity is more frequent; in 2021 only 5% of them reported that they were without sex in the last year.
Among free people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
The decline in sexual activity is also contributed to by the fear of premarital intercourse and religious beliefs.
Despite the higher likelihood of married couples being sexually active, the percentage of married men and women under 35 years old is still decreasing.
Young people's opinion on premarital sex is divided, with around 30% considering it a bad thing, while approximately 70% believe it is alright.
English: "It is true that among single individuals in this age group they are a minority, but their behavior shifts this trend," Stone speaks about these thirty percent.
For the majority of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious beliefs.
Since 2008, among single people under the age of 35 who attend religious gatherings more than once a month, the rate of abstinence has increased from 20% to almost 60%.
Among the "less religious" the trend rose from 10 to 20%," declared Stone.
The decline in sexual activity can also be attributed to other factors, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the likelihood of having sex is lower among people without jobs or with lower incomes.
Another reason could be the expansion of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thereby "replacing" this need.
This trend mainly took hold during the lockdown in the time of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole vaccination mandate against Covid is about whether society should force a part of the population to adopt a behavior they do not want, but which might save their lives.
English: It is a relatively difficult question, and what personally interests me the most is the question of social conscience.
English: That is, for example, the question of whether, if we don't order them to do it and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be responsible for the death of an eighty-year-old man, who actually didn't know much, we didn't explain it to him well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result, he didn't get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can be blamed for the death of a stubborn vaccination opponent, who, alongside SPD and KSC, is shouting something about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly inferred that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners most likely belong to the second group, thus they can indeed blame themselves for it.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This year's winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times.
Ski resort operators cannot do without artificial snow, weather complicates even the preparation of the cross-country Jizerská Fifty, for example.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it's not about dog lovers.
English: Once in high school, our teacher led us across the entire city to the shipyard, so we could take a boat ride along the river.
On the way there, we went down a pretty wide street and guess who we saw in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
English: Of course, everything collapsed on us.
English: Fortunately, I escaped, but they started talking to one of my friends.
When she left them, both we and the teacher asked her what she had told them.
English: "They asked me if I supposedly want to save my soul."
I told them that I don't have a soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We are terribly spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovič
English: The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must jointly demonstrate that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, caused by alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, according to the Chancellor, including within the framework of the "Normandy group", which brings together France, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine.
English: Morawiecki stated that he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially created a migration crisis and uses people as human shields and weapons, as every night we record a hundred attempts of (illegal) border crossings.
The chancellor discussed further sanctions to make Lukashenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
According to DPA agency, Scholz assured that Warsaw receives German support in the conflict with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by Lukashenko's regime.
Drunk Polish nun caused an accident, tried to conceal it
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but it was driven by a different nun who tried to take the blame for it.
When the police informed her that she could still lose her driving license for not giving way while driving and leaving the scene of an accident, she told the truth, according to TVN24 station.
She admitted that another nun had crashed into the vehicle and asked her for help.
English: The police officers then came for Sister Celestine.
They subjected her to a breath test and after finding out that she had over two per mille in her blood, they immediately took away her driver's license.
At the same time, they informed her that she would be testifying about her actions in court.
Dog Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Šajmovič did not keep an eye on his film.
Czech creators of family comedies became fond of American stories about beloved dogs.
But they forgot about an essential thing: the laws of filmmaking craft.
English: After F. Brabec's kitschy movie Gump - The Dog Who Taught People to Live, now another film Here We Guard is competing for the audience's emotions in cinemas.
Co-writer and director in one person, Juraj Šajmovič Jr., loosely continues with his previous film "I'm in Charge Here" from 2012.
On the scene, the talking dachshund Hugo returns and some familiar characters around him.
English: Julie and Ivan, owners of a declining Šumava guesthouse, start inviting dog owners, Julie's father with his partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but rather a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
English: The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the film's producer) struggled with narrative techniques in their previous dog-themed film, but at least it entertained children and the dog.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script, which evokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's summarize it.
English: Julie, despite being a scientist, succumbs to the desire for a child guided by superstitions, and when the right "constellation" comes, she mates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates determine – on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course, during an ongoing excursion with a local guide). Retired Colonel Mojmír, despite many years of training, accidentally shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the forest, who falls into a coma. She is then taken away by her family to a hospital, so that a miraculous healing process can take place in the heart of the Šumava solitude, aided by a dog.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of animal pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
English: The viewer, however, marvels at the chaotic jumble full of unbelievable situations and characters that was necessary for this message.
English: A pair of thieves from the staff, a dog owners' competition, a Šumava charlatan, police officers arriving on a tip to search for "drugs" and discussing the fertility power of bone meal over herbs - and of course, a cunning family at the guest house gets everyone drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma and then sits at the family table with wavy hair and makeup, holding a cigarette and demanding her father's whiskey and meat as a cured vegetarian, you can't help but laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "it sometimes happens after a coma."
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build strong situations, a sense for character traits and punchlines, and directorial guidance.
English: The acting performances are uneven, the editing is helpless, and the overall impression is sloppy.
Although Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková, and Nela Boudová try their best to withstand their roles, they don't have much to play.
The only positive aspect of the film remains the poetic shots of Šumava nature by cinematographer Vladimír Holomka and the pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to sketch a few characters, a weak plot, and dog-like catchphrases, let alone the more vernacular vulgar expressions the characters tend to use.
The argument is not even the long-term membership in the Dachshund Breeders Club - as in the case of the lady producer.
For promoting nature and friendship between man and dog with good intentions, one must also have a knowledge of the trade if they want to tell a believable story.
In this case, it did not succeed.
For a good family photo, there's a bit too much eroticism and a minimum of emotion for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canister therapy, this amateurishly conceived piece wouldn't pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant swearing exactly from idiots like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, here it can be seen how little you understand it, but that's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer; if they don't want it, the answer will always be no.
English: If you had listened to such kids all the time, maybe you would have changed your opinion.
It is a job like any other, in this case a part-time job for extra income.
The Middle East is troubled by unusually dry months.
English: Winter is the only season of the year when it rains.
"Almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have recorded at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israeli Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term precipitation average for November.
The two-day rain from this week was rather an exception.
For us, it's good.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
Also, it is the right Christmas setting, rejoiced the inhabitant of Nazareth, Wasim Ashkar.
Precipitation in Israel occurs almost exclusively in the winter months, and is sporadic and irregular.
On winter rains, the forests are dependent.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not just about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, was filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been decreasing.
Water managers warned about the drought long ago.
"It can be expected that depending on global warming and climate changes, precipitation may decrease here," predicted in 2018 Uri Schor, spokeswoman for the Israeli Water Authority.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Economically weaker countries like Lebanon, Syria, or Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the Jordanian capital, Amman, there is an increasing number of tanker trucks.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
English: "This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the previous two years," reported Imad Sulejman, a tanker truck driver, in September.
In the Iranian Isfahan, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The riverbed of the local river was completely without water.
English: The region has experienced the driest November in many recent years.
Israel is preparing a military strike against Iran
The Israeli Defense Minister stated that the talks in Vienna did not bring "any progress" and that he informed Washington about preparations for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
English: Minister Benny Gantz announced on Saturday that he has ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the USA, is trying to convince Americans to increase their pressure on Iran, but also informed Washington about military preparations.
During the press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna have not brought "any progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them."
English: About 3 years ago, this happened to me as well.
English: I liked the young lady a bit and grilled her during the conversation to find out what she actually wants from me.
In the end, I found out that my suspicion about the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I bothered the young lady with doubts and questions for a while longer, and then finally thanked her and left.
Feel free to call me a scoundrel, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers set out for the mountains over the weekend, awaiting plenty of snow and nice weather.
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major influx of skiing enthusiasts this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the work week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operations thanks to this.
Skiers were not deterred by the obligation to present a COVID certificate at the ski lifts.
While ski lift operators do not complain about the lack of customer interest, some ski equipment rental shops report lower demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Over the weekend, thousands of people in the Liberec region headed to cross-country trails and ski slopes.
The weather favored the skiers today, offering sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really worked out well, starting from Friday evening skiing when we had the first skiers on the hill," praised the interest of the director of the Ještěd Sports Area, Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people went for the first weekend skiing in the new season also to the Jeseníky Mountains.
Open, for example, were Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branná in the Šumperk region.
Weekend attendance was very decent, on Saturday and today an estimated 400 people came.
English: The conditions are great.
English: The sun was shining today, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, the representative of the Branná ski resort, Rostislav Procházka, did not skimp on praise.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or are within the period after recovering from the COVID-19 illness.
Except for a few exceptions, people are prepared for it and provide the necessary documents, said Rene Hrones from the Spindleruv Mlyn ski center to CTK.
"We have recorded only a handful of incidents," he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic is reported by some ski rental and equipment stores.
English: Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava store in Opava.
Greater influx is expected during the period of ski courses.
Also, David Šinták, the manager of the Hradec Králové-based company Snowbear, feels that due to Covid, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
At this time before the pandemic, we were almost overextended.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
According to him, people have become lazy due to the pandemic and have learned to stay at home.
On the contrary, a high demand is recorded by the rental service in the Novako complex in Boží Dar.
They started renting skis there a week ago and now interested parties must order them in advance.
"Cross-country skis will be available for rent starting this weekend, but people have already called in advance, so we expect high demand, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the facility operator.
English: According to her, there is also an interest in the ski school comparable to the period before the epidemic.
If we want successful and wealthy people not to leave for abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life here, just as they would abroad.
That certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or specialist doctor.
Smart and skilled people who have no property here are leaving for abroad.
The owner of the company won't really leave for abroad just like that.
English: But I totally agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began when one beautiful day Orbán won, ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration increased by several tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
English: Another issue is elections altogether.
When life gets bad here, a traditional V4 madman can also win here.
Young and educated people will leave, only his supporters and those whose property cannot be stuffed into an airplane will remain.
Terrifying photo!
Langmajer in blood over a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the film crew of "Island" led by Jiří Langmajer (55) was enjoying tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor published a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it makeup for filming?
English: London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
English: She was last seen on her way home.
"The disappearance of Petra does not resemble her behavior at all, and we are starting to worry a lot about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in the Lambeth district, where Srncová worked, in a Saturday video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman reportedly left work on Sunday, November 28th, around 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell district.
English: She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nurse assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We have immense concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," stated the group of medical facilities in a Twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Public cooperation is also called for by MP Harriet Harman, who drew attention to Srncová's case at a press conference on Saturday.
English: "She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably distraught," said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police in her hand.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her because she was away from her homeland, away from her family, and worked here for our healthcare," said Harmanová.
English: Police had previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC news website, however, the police have not provided any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. approximately 5 divisions).
English: I don't underestimate Ukraine like this, either.
That's not a "huge amount", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps saying that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is getting fed up with our involvement.
I quoted above.
I don't know what made you think that Russia wants war.
English: War is a damn expensive joke and Russia has GDP of Italy.
Comparison with the situation in 1938 is so off in so many points that I don't even know where to begin.
English: I can now compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced it does not intend to adhere to the Minsk agreements, Russia annexes those ridiculous republics.
That's about it, and that would correspond to the "concentration" at the borders.
Well, agreements must be kept...
In Prague, new timetables have been in effect since Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections.
Passengers in the Prague Integrated Transport (PID) can expect several changes from Sunday, mainly concerning suburban connections.
New routes emerged, some changed their route, and others disappeared.
English: The Mlada Boleslav region is newly integrated into the system.
In the capital, express trains from České Budějovice stop at Zahradní Město station since Sunday.
In suburban train transport, the S7 trains will depart, which pass through Prague's main railway station on their route from Beroun to Český Brod.
In the recently opened Praha-Zahradní Město station, the express train R17 from České Budějovice and Benešov will now be stopping.
English: PID will be newly expanded into further areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatná u Jesenice, Staré Splavy, and Turnov.
Buses will be integrated in the Mladá Boleslav region, including lines extending into the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones will be introduced, and the operation of 12 existing ones will be adjusted.
From Prague's Zličín, a new bus line 405 will depart, which will go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection Prague - Kralovice near Rakovník has also been established, which replaces the canceled train line S53.
In the morning peak hours and on weekends, connections from Prague to Rakovnik will be strengthened, with the new express route number 404 now departing.
Newly, lines 400 and 410 are included in the PID system, operating in the Liberec region.
They depart from Střížkov metro station, not from Nádraží Holešovice station.
English: The backbone line 400 goes through Mělník, Duba, and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor, and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
English: The supplementary line 410 runs through Mělník and Dubá to Doksy, Mimoň and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the contrary, operation is now canceled or limited on ten Central Bohemian local routes, among others to Mochov, Dobříš, or Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.
All trains departing from Prague at 2:30 AM are canceled.
Due to railway modernization, long-term restrictions continue on the Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem, and in the vicinity of Kolín lines.
English: Changes are also waiting for passengers in other places.
Buses are replacing some canceled railway lines or the section on line 420 from Dobříš is being extended with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets all the way to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymburk area have undergone changes, and some bus routes on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Plzeň region have been adjusted.
Healthy snack/lunch for the office from the supermarket
Hello, I work a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break, and my only option for getting food is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Considering that I have no physical activity, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthily and diet-friendly as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry, I'll buy at most a pizza bun and have a yogurt and apple for a snack.
Question: What healthy food without the need for cooking would you recommend me to buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone is looking forward to a meter of snow like you are, unfortunately that's how it is.
And it's not about the trees that you necessarily have to see.
Under the snow, only the tip of a small tree may be hidden.
If it gets damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying it's the only reason why they forbid us to ride off-piste, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedvěd: I was not looking forward to this at all
English: Since Friday, the Czech showbiz pond has been living with nothing but the revelation of Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedved's relationship.
They have been together since the summer, the famous football player even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent her fans an extensive message, in which she explains why she kept the love secret from them for a long half-year.
"I dare say that currently there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who doesn't know that Dara caught a bear, I mean, sorry, Nedved," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech football player.
English: They say he picked her up, not the other way around.
Three days are in the spotlight, and although they are used to the public's interest, they do not enjoy it.
And here it is.
That which we both were not looking forward to, but we knew it would eventually happen, continues the singer.
I just don't know who has it worse.
If those who are not interested at all and it pops up on them even from a can, or us, who analyze their lives in great detail.
English: As if any of you wanted to hear an opinion on whether you and your spouse or girlfriend are a good match, or insisted that everyone should really know the detailed list of your former partners and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and failures.
English: That is obviously a problem, you want that, it bothers Dara.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rolins traveled for the preparations of her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been working as the vice president of the football club Juventus for a long time.
They came out with the truth only now, because they were waiting for the completion of Nedvěd's divorce.
With his wife Ivana, they have been separated for three years already, but they have only been officially apart for three weeks.
English: Anyway, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
And we are just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We are not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
And that's why I love my new man, and just like he stands by me, I stand by him too. In good and bad, Rolins concluded.
Hello, the other commenters have probably already said everything important, I just confirm that the dormitories are great for the beginning, my classmates mostly got to know and became friends during the first semester or two and then found shared rentals together, which seems to me the best option, because you know who you will be living with.
Apartments are usually not advertised too long in advance, so you probably won't find much right now, but looking at the offers definitely won't hurt.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also its surroundings (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., it's a pretty bad address), and some parts of Židenice are somewhat ghetto.
On the contrary, the Veveří district is very student-oriented, Královo Pole and that direction is nice, and besides, it is close to most of the faculties of VUT (I don't know exactly where you are starting).
I have never looked for a rental myself, but I am a native of Brno, so I can advise you on Brno in general if you still need any information :)
That's quite an example of a completely "normal" way of thinking.
Due to what some doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually completely fine that the state does not sufficiently fund certain schools.
Either let them learn what they want and pay for it themselves, or let them follow the state's recommendations and have the state pay for it.
Of course, we cannot let a private actor take control of a piece of the education system just because they add a few crowns to a full-fledged state contribution and, thanks to that, they will be able to teach whatever they want in schools.
Such a claim loses some weight when it's written by a person who, two days before, expressed themselves this way about a petition action for the boycott of a totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone having an abortion is the same for you as a vote against a statue standing in the square?
If I were you, I would consult directly with the person who assigned you that work.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloging/digitization that (even long-time professionals) either throw something in approximately or write something like xxx *** or... (according to convention) and note that it is unreadable.
The truth is, in this case, it is quite readable, so I would not completely recommend it.
Personally, I would deal with it somehow in a note, depending on which program you are using.
If you want to be a diligent and hardworking student, you can look into some sign databases and find the nearest one.
But since it seems that you are drawing from some book, I would guess that the author or printer simply created their own symbol, which fits what is physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it more likely the Odrysian Empire (kingdom) rather than OdryNian?
PSS: Someone has already figured it out for you here.
Look at that comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what will be the "theme" of our presidency.
That is a much worse mess than them having interpreters with them.
The idea of something being approved because nobody understood a certain text is amusing.
English: All important approved documents are examined word by word, for that basic knowledge of English is not enough, it is a matter for lawyers.
In various EU institutions, hundreds of translators and interpreters work, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relationships.
English: Moreover, with that English, it is quite interesting after the UK's exit from the EU.
I don't understand the hate towards Cejl.
I have been working there for three years already and it's totally fine.
How many times have I traveled from work at 10 pm and never had any problem.
The fact that it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly ever set foot in there in their life.
Yes, most of the Roma population of Brno probably lives there, but all they do is block the pavement and park where they shouldn't :D It's definitely not that I'd be afraid to go out on the street there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the city center, I would definitely go for it.
Many apartments there are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda and mistress Gelemová like a pole in the fence!
English: Who will spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on their Advent wreath, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light up.
English: I saw the wreath and Lucie definitely has one too, said the saxophonist to Blesk, confirming Patrasová's words that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda remained alone after his departure.
Slováček still doesn't know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
English: Recently, we met with Anička, Felix, and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we still kept talking to each other, so we didn't get to Christmas.
I really don't know where I will be.
I buy gifts continuously and I will definitely buy something for Dada and Lucia, probably perfume.
I am a gentleman, added Felix, who came to the music video premiere at the Richman club by himself.
I am here alone, but I don't feel lonely.
I always find someone to have fun with, claims Slováček, who was glad to meet Ludek Sobota's wife Adriana and the singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clearly known.
And we are Iceland, so that we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that someone will defend us for ourselves and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why that should be a bad argument, can you explain that to me?
I don't know of any other unit that could be deployed in hospitals during a crisis.
There are too few police officers, and they cannot afford it, as well as firefighters, and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level.
And the fact that our army is capable of defending just Ostrava is the fault of previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for quite some time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the countryside should not just be a factory for food, says the journalist.
Czech Republic is experiencing the worst period of drought in recent years.
According to scientists, there has been a decrease in water in mountain and foothill areas, and even places that have not previously experienced a lack of moisture are now recording lower precipitation totals.
The cause of the drought, which prevails in a large part of Central Europe, is climate change.
Impacts are also exacerbated by the way we manage the soil.
What to prepare for in connection with drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, it's going to be like that, I can barely stay on skates on the ice, I have no idea what it is to play hockey, and that tactic (that I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also overall crazy.
And whether you are the hockey team "Russian Bear" or "Chinese Lama," losing by two goals even if you don't have to win the match at all costs is different than when it's tied.
English: But anyway, what I listen to are Czech commentators who point out what the referees pay attention to or don't pay attention to in both men's and women's hockey. It's all strange, but it's probably like that with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsports like F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
English: And in my opinion, if it were the other way around, it would be like always, and since the Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would probably be a classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: Number of infections in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday, December 11th, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
There are 5,766 people hospitalized.
English: A total of 34,451 people have died in the Czech Republic, plus another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic are 1967 per 100,000, and 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
English: In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
English: It is the lowest daily number since October 13.
English: The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, it is the lowest daily death count since the end of October.
Britain faces an "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omicron, said Dr. Susan Hopkins, the chief medical advisor for the British Health Security Agency, on Sunday television.
There will be a need for new quarantine measures.
Persons infected with Omicron are already being hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their number to increase.
So far, no one has died from Omicron, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
The leader of the British Labour Party, Keir Starmer, stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson likely violated the law by organizing a Christmas quiz at Downing Street last December when the lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
One of Johnson's government ministers defended that the quiz took place "virtually" via computer.
Of course, groups of employees gathered around computers participated in it at Downing Street.
In the United Kingdom, pressure is growing to remove Johnson from the prime minister's position.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers organized numerous parties despite the lockdown.
English: The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government were making fun of them:
Paul Brand, commercial editor of ITV for Britain: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won a crushing majority in the general elections.
English: This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the position of Prime Minister.
Remarkable, how quickly events have developed.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is expecting elections in the spring, which could end the twelve-year rule of Viktor Orbán.
These will be elections of European-wide importance.
How much can we expect them to be fair?
They will not be fair.
They probably won't be free either, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the borders of electoral districts to benefit from it, and performs other smaller or larger tricks.
The latest one says that, in practice, everyone can choose where they want to vote.
This will allow Fidesz to transport voters from decided districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating, there will be no space at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
Before, it was not about whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether they would have a constitutional majority as well.
Now there is a real chance that the united opposition will gain more votes and mandates.
That is a big unusual thing for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Will they not strive even harder to maintain their power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the Parliament Speaker and one of the Fidesz leaders, László Kövér, was leaked to independent media, in which he tells the heads of secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
English: Are these the signs of the new approach you are talking about?
Yes, that is one of those innovations.
Everything starts with language.
I used to be beaten quite often, the last time when I was 14, my mother does not have much patience, neither do I, my father has it for a long time, but then he snaps extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I used to get angry terribly as a child, to the extent that I would lie on the ground in a cramp and be all blue, that probably happened to me 2 times when they took me under the shower to calm me down.
Occasionally, they slapped me for educational purposes, sometimes it was more like they didn't know what else to do.
Definitely, I also have a tendency to deal with things violently now, as a child I used to fight quite a bit, now to release my tension, I at least hit something, and as a younger person, I would for example slap my parents on the hand (so I wouldn't get hit too much), so never anything extreme, but I always have that urge.
I am not able to determine to what extent it is due to my explosiveness, but certainly upbringing also plays its part in it.
I'm afraid that I will also lose patience with my children and handle it the same way.
I think that hitting children is simply wrong, and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at the moment when it wasn't for "educational" purposes, but out of frustration. On the other hand, perhaps every parent messes up something, so it's probably not possible to not traumatize their children at least a little bit, so I don't blame them for that.
It doesn't offend me in any way, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of something.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So, I would call those who create laws in such quality as fools.
Otherwise, I would be interested if you are not afraid of a loss of income?
Can it really be expected that people will want and buy the product, and you will have the means to pay off your mortgage?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the process with the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins in the case involving the four defendants accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
She revitalized civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
What fundamental turning point will the process mean for Slovakia?
For this, journalists are hugely responsible.
How is it possible that this petition received significantly more media attention than the counter-petition of deans of all medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?
Well, they let themselves be fooled and the society paid for it.
On Czech television, people were dying with COVID even half a year ago.
English: Another government is ending and the law on involving municipalities in the selection of a storage facility is nowhere to be found
English: Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs a fundamental revision
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is coming to an end, and the law that was supposed to ensure the respect of the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and permitting of deep geological repositories for highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Government Legislative Council interrupted the discussion of the proposal, which the Ministry of Industry and Trade submitted to the government after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against the deep repository, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
English: Local governments expect a significantly stronger reinforcement of their decision-making powers regarding the repository, as has been promised to mayors since 2011 when the first work on this legislation began, and which is required by both the Czech nuclear law and the European directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will revise the proposal in cooperation with municipalities.
The draft law by Minister Karel Havlíček, which the Platform has at its disposal, is mainly criticized by municipalities for: The proposed level of municipal and public involvement in the decision-making process for the selection of a storage site is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
English: It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given location at all.
This can be ensured by requiring the Storage Administration to request the consent of the affected municipalities before starting a specific procedure.
The submitted proposal of the material intent almost completely neglects public involvement and turns citizens of municipalities into mere statistics in the permitting process.
In the proposal, there is a lack of a compensation system settings for municipalities throughout the entire process of searching and selecting a location for the repository, its licensing, and operation.
English: Representatives of municipalities, according to today's legal norms, do not have many options for defending the interests of their citizens when searching for a location for a storage facility.
English: Only in some permitting procedures can individuals submit their comments or appeal, however, the decision lies with the authority or minister, in whose interest it is to issue the permit.
The potential lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on the execution of exploration or construction works.
Co-decision-making of local governments, which the Platform demands, is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries, and definitely in those where they have already made progress in permitting repositories, such as in Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is also another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms for the preparation of legislation.
In this case, it is about a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and following the contracts with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total amount for this work, according to the contract registry, is almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the municipality of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesperson of the Platform against the deep repository said: After ministers of industry, who only postponed addressing the position of self-governments in relation to state authorities in the search for a deep repository of highly radioactive waste for their successors, we expect a more significant change from the new government.
English: We also offer a helping hand for that.
English: We would also like to thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for their support, as they perceive the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such fundamental constructions similarly to the directly affected municipalities in the selected locations.
English: The platform against deep geological repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) to promote a change in the state's approach to dealing with spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to just a deep geological repository.
The platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of a location for possible storage should be conditional on the prior consent of the affected municipalities.
Duke John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight due to fear: He dropped 90 kg.
Although he didn't feel the need to change his lifestyle for many years, in the end the doctors scared him.
English: They told him that if he doesn't lose weight, he will die.
And that worked.
English: Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun daily newspaper.
He showed off his new figure in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
From the fat guy in the sitcom Roseanne, he is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family pleaded with him to lose weight because his large body caused the furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth," said the actor in 2018 in an interview for AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
English: Move, exercise.
I'm reaching an age where I can no longer afford to sit in one place, Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss and in what context you want to use the word "boss".
If it's about some text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text, for example at university level, I would probably look for how to describe or explain a boss more.
To everything, there are more types of bosses.
English: For example, a game like Dark Souls and others has several bosses, right, and so a "boss" is something like a lord/ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who do not need to be defeated at all for the game or level to be completed, but they are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player does not directly confront them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called that way?
And then there are mini bosses.
English: It is probably not possible to translate the word "boss" into a single, general term, as neither Czech nor other languages have a specific solution for this (an interesting exception might be Catalan, which translates "boss" as the final opponent).
It is simply a generally significant story or game, computer-controlled, stronger adversary than all previous ones, guarding the completion of a certain level or task.
The whole world is searching for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
The British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncová since December 3.
The Czech police also got involved in the search.
That 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišťsko has been missing since December 7th.
Through Interpol, it also helps the British police.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on November 28th.
British police have been searching for her since December 3rd.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular because of her.
So the whole world is searching for Petra.
"The Czech police are closely cooperating with the British police," confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
"We share information about the case together," she added.
The announced search for Petra has also appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, slim, and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from the Uherské Hradiště region.
Petra worked as a nurse at one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, as such disappearance is very unusual for her.
During the search for Petra, local MP Harriet Harman also got involved.
She participated in hanging up flyers with Petra's face on them.
"We have huge concerns about her," said at Saturday's press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already detained one suspect.
However, it is not clear who it is about and what they had in common with Petra.
English: Pre-Christmas Czech Republic is terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While the data in October showed a slight decrease in offensive campaigns, last month, as the end of the year approached, the attacks significantly intensified.
We recorded a large campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18th.
Attacks are specifically targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the email aims to attract the user's attention with a title referring to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in its name, this time it was marked as Copy of receipt corrections for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as email clients like Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex.
Harmful code actively searches for stored login credentials, which are then sent to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of attackers is increasing again.
In November, the Formbook spyware remained active.
English: Unlike Agent Tesla, in this case, the attackers are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November mainly detected campaigns with global reach.
In comparison to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still accounts for nearly one-fifth of all detections.
The attacks were ongoing throughout the entire month, with increased activity on November 3rd, 10th, and 15th.
English: Formbook most often contained an attachment with the .exe extension, which bore the name REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
The name receipt still appears though.
Attachment in Czech can be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
Significant decline and dampening of activity is recorded by security analysts in the Fareit program, which accounted for 1.6 percent of attacks and in the Czech Republic had no major offensive campaign in recent months.
English: Today's demo of smart folks who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The Prague procession was larger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the procession along the embankment and my experience as a demonstrator, I'm not afraid to estimate around 10 thousand people.
People in the parade filled the embankment, the bridge, and the opposite riverside communication.
English: That means there are really many people.
English: To the procession of about four thousand demonstrators, an unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join.
I claim that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the permanent dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led to them finding a common language.
Only the anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers, and the like themselves wouldn't be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The events of the association "Chcípl pes" are gaining popularity, it reminds me of "Milión chvilek pro demokracii" turned upside down.
English: Sometimes I have the impression that they even rent the same stage and equipment.
It is difficult to say what kind of movement could be bribed from this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the influx of money, but also on whether the triple dose vaccine from Pfizer will not become a four or more dose one.
Definitely, it won't be a left-wing or centrist movement, you can bet on that.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose one, because it is clear that we will have to get re-vaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that the vaccines saved us.
Brilliant action by scientists, which humanity is rightfully proud of.
End of the deadlock, Bulgaria has a new prime minister announcing change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has entrusted Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement "We Continue the Change" with forming a new government after they won the November elections.
English: Tom has already managed to form a broad coalition government, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the pressure of anti-corruption protests.
English: The victorious parties proclaiming the fight against corruption and abuse of power, however, could not agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is watching?
From the "secretly" recorded footage, it has become a global hit.
In the United Kingdom over the weekend, concerns grew regarding the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman, who has been sought by London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work in the south of the British metropolis.
English: After receiving information about the children's hospital worker, not only the police but also her current employer and a Member of Parliament representing the part of London where she lived are calling.
"The disappearance of Petra is completely unlike her behavior, and we are starting to worry a lot about her," Lucy O'Connor from the police department in the Lambeth district, where Srncová worked, said in a Saturday video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman reportedly left work on Sunday, November 28th, around 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell district.
English: She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncová worked as an "assistant to nurses" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We have immense concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," stated a group of medical facilities in a tweet.
"We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Sumperk amateur painter of children's rooms, Zdenka Dvorakova Kocourkova (and also a regional Pirate Party councilor) was reported by an anonymous person for violating copyright laws with her paintings.
The court, however, acknowledged that the Mole paintings in the Šumperk rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a hole in the road in the shape of a channel without a cover for a month.
It was a matter of life.
The municipal office referred the complaints to the Road and Motorway Directorate, which the road belongs to, and because it reportedly did not respond, the hole remained.
In the end, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the Road and Motorway Directorate began to "intensively address the situation".
