From my point of view, the literature program was formed by ladies of Balzac age based on their interests.
From the 19th century Russian literature, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the perspective of those very ladies of the Balzac age.
And the psychology and torments of Tolstoy's and Turgenev's heroines are not as interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are generally rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige Mattress 105x195.
Model "Micropacket Prestige": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different firmness on each side: medium-firm surface is formed by latex-coated coconut fiber and natural latex, while moderately soft side is made of a natural latex layer.
Spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the sleeping body, preventing the appearance of the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model, it is necessary to highlight breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for air permeability, is excellently ventilated naturally, just like coir coconut.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate of the sleeping area is maintained.
Also, an extended warranty period applies to the mattress.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years, but in practice, the mattress lasts longer.
English: Protection from dust and dirt is provided by a removable jacquard cover, included in the package.
Purchase an orthopedic pillow to pair with the mattress – it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as an anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

With horror, I recall those feasts and guests at my parents' house.
Guests are at the doorstep, and the cutlets are still being fried on the stove, mom with disheveled hair is finishing washing the floor.
Lord, I sat down at the table already exhausted.
And then wash the dishes and clean the house.
A week before the holiday, you haul groceries, spend two days cooking, and a day cleaning up afterwards.
And what about the guests?
They are good, and they must definitely have a cake with them.

Even for my own family, I set the table to the bare minimum.
And I cook delicious dishes for them, I bake very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth coronavirus vaccination is inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final one, but will continue with renewed vigor.
Despite the active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will likely be enough for full protection.
In this, the head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced.
On Saturday, December 11, Die Welt reports.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be needed in the summer, at the latest in the fall," believes the expert.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with vaccination against the flu."
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination may help in the fight against the spread of the new coronavirus strain "Omicron."
Moreover, the new variant is particularly dangerous.
Yes, the likelihood of re-infection with "Omicron" is three times higher than with the Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide an Omicron-adapted vaccine by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new "Omicron" variant of coronavirus.
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times."
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the Omicron strain," emphasized BioNTech and Pfizer.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, advocates for reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Zaltsberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of coronavirus.
"The experience of Israel very convincingly shows this," the expert emphasized.
Wobbler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
English: The Bet-A-Vib series - a special branch of the Bet-A family from the company Pontoon21®.
She (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes by being originally designed for use in ice fishing, not just for casting fishing.
These lures have a larger specific weight than similar-sized analogues, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin made of durable and elastic plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vibe" for vertical fishing, the Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a fairly aggressive play.
Often, the most effective can be a simple monotonous animation, that is, movements of the fishing rod up and down almost without pauses.
In planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient for fishing in a limited space, cluttered with underwater vegetation, driftwood, and other obstacles that can be hooked.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for walleye and large perch in the winter, especially in the middle of winter when precise and aggressive bait presentation is required.
Upon reaching the end point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the initial vertical position.
No less successfully, Bet-A-Vib is also used for winter fishing of pond trout.
To cater to her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib lure, when used in a vertical jigging motion, is able to provoke a passive pike, which does not even react to live bait.
During casting, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates range and accuracy.
This wobbler is clear and not capricious, it works well with both monofilament and braided lines, even with large diameters.
For casting fishing of pike, zander, ruffe, or perch, besides the uniform method, the "step" technique is also relevant, sometimes with "scratching" the bottom.
If you are fishing in snaggy areas, you can replace the front treble hook with a double hook, which will reduce the likelihood of snags.
Among lures of its class, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most effective in catching fish.
With equal success, it can be used both on relatively shallow and quite deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, they reported about 7 thousand Russian mercenaries
In Libya, there are more than 7 thousand mercenaries of the private military company (PMC) "Wagner".
English: On Sunday, December 12, the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic, Khaled al-Mishri, announced this.
At the present time, there are more than 7 thousand mercenaries of the Wagner Private Military Company in Libya.
They have airplanes as well.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jet aircraft at Gardabia airbases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte), according to his words reported by Anadolu agency.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to capture" the central part of Libya, extending from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain presence
According to the source of the publication, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya".
"Wagner" has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufra, as noted in the agency's publication.
Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner PMC (Private Military Company) receives support from the Kremlin.
Where else could there be mercenaries
According to the agency, "Wagner" allegedly operates in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal security for leaders, and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use minerals and natural resources, as well as supplies of weapons, technologies, and military services to these countries," the article says.
As the media claims, "Wagnerians" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan, and the Central African Republic.
This group is not registered in any law enforcement agencies or in the legal entities registry, and its fighters are not on the personnel rosters.
This company is under US sanctions.
English: Let us remind you, earlier the permanent representatives of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against "Wagner".
It is expected that the European Union Council will approve this decision on December 13.
Situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is, in fact, the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions, dominated by Islamists, according to TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single voting day for the parliamentary deputies and the head of state elections from December 24th to at least February 2022.
"Less than two weeks remain until the elections, and the chances that they will be held on time are rapidly decreasing," the material notes.
English: Against this backdrop, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates for an indefinite period, reports Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, while 29% believe that failures prevail.
Examples of successes - "protected in Syria, restored peace there", "decision on 'Nord Stream 2'", "intimidated the whole world with powerful weapons", "we took Crimea back".
Major failures include "conflict with Ukraine," "confrontation with Western countries," "isolation from the world," according to a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The Dubai Government has completely abandoned paper documentation - all public services have also become digital only.
The Dubai government has announced a complete abandonment of paper documentation and a transition to digital technologies.
All state services for the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new stage in the digitization of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," announced on Saturday the Crown Prince of the emirate, Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
Now, internal and external document circulation in all Dubai government institutions will be carried out only in digital format through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all industries without exception: healthcare, housing and utilities, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial organizations have also joined the government initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitization of document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, as estimated by the authorities, 336 million paper sheets have been saved, which amounts to 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin stated that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
Dana, well, about birth dates and how old a child is, this is already absurd, about the class and group in kindergarten too.
Well, I don't believe that such scatterbrains exist.

At first they knocked on the door, then on the window, then decided not to stand on ceremony, broke the window and climbed in, but the grandfather had a baseball bat, which they got hit with.
These people definitely knew that there was someone at home...
Production and export of cars in Turkey fell below the 2020 level
Production and export of Turkish cars sharply decreased in November amid the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the industry's performance for the 11 months turned out to be worse than last year's result, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Turkish Automotive Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, in November, 115,000 cars were produced in Turkey, which is 20% less than the previous year.
Approximately 75.9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% lower than last year's figure.
And if for the first 10 months of this year, the automotive sector in Turkey demonstrated a positive dynamic compared to last year, then by the end of 11 months in 2021, car production turned out to be 0.3% worse than the previous year's result.
The reason for such a decline was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira exchange rate, which fell by 29% against the dollar in November.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
English: Over 500 SME subjects received a deferment on credit payments in 2021
English: The First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov spoke about the situation regarding the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, reports correspondent of MIA "Kazinform".
According to the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, in the current year, in accordance with the order of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, the order of the Chairman of the Agency dated April 9, 2021 No. 127 "On Approval of the Procedure for Granting Deferrals of Payments on Loans to Small and Medium Business Entities" was adopted, – Alikhan Smailov wrote in his reply to the parliamentary inquiry.
He reminded that the procedure for providing deferment of loan payments stipulated that banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities should provide deferral of payments on loans issued to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), including individual entrepreneurs, from April 1 to June 30, 2021, for loans issued before April 1, 2021.
The deferral period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the discretion of the SME subject.
In the borrower's statement, a different deferral period for payments could have been specified.
During the deferral period, claims and lawsuit work related to the borrower were suspended, as well as the notification of the need to repay overdue debts, and the creditor's collection of commissions and other payments," noted the deputy prime minister.
For the year 2021, second-tier banks received applications for loan payment deferrals from 603 MSB borrowers, of which 553 MSB entities received deferrals for a total amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
In the MFO, 131 SME subjects submitted applications for a deferral, of which a deferral was granted to 95 subjects in the amount of 105.8 million tenge," concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity may be able to easily tolerate the "Omicron" strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may cope with it easier than those who have a strong defensive reaction of the body.
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the coronavirus strain "Omicron" could be dangerous.
The cause should be sought in the conditions of the virus's emergence.
Scientists believe that "Omicron" originated in the body of a person infected with HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
That is, during the mutation, it did not encounter any resistance from the immune system.
Due to this, he is more aggressive.
Due to the lack of response from the immune system, it became very fast.
Apparently, he has more spike proteins, spikes, than he should have, and their antibodies were not reduced during the mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems may handle the "Omicron" variant more easily than those with a strong defense response from the body.
It turns out that a strong response of the body to something, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
So this happens with pneumococcal infections when young people around 30 years old die, and seniors around 60 years old carry it as a sneeze.
The immune response is furious in the young, it is absolutely inadequate: where it was possible to just wag a finger, it hits like a cannon at sparrows, - concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects, and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs can be bacterial and viral.
If the first case is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, often only the symptoms can be alleviated - all hope is on the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication in the body - this is a fever, weakness, malaise.
Then come respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, throat irritation, cough.
Pain on the right or left side, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, vaccination of the younger generation aged 12 to 18 may begin by the end of the year.
Virologist and head of the genomic engineering laboratory at MIPT, Pavel Volchkov, noted that this category suffers very actively from COVID.
For teenagers who attend school, the number of contacts is at its maximum.
This is the most socially active stratum, just like kindergarten children, - Pavel Volchkov, a virologist, head of the genetic engineering laboratory at MIPT, told "Moscow 24".
Huge gratitude to the author for this article.

English: In those distant seventies-eighties, no dance floor could do without the melodies of this group.
And at home, getting together with friends, they organized dances to their music.
Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of COVID.
The authors of the study examined adipose tissue remaining from bariatric surgeries and discovered that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells, located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected, and demonstrated a strong inflammatory response in the process.
Scientists also studied the adipose tissue of patients who died from COVID-19 and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid the immune system's response.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 is capable of this as well.
The biologist explained the reasons for the emergence of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheykin named the causes of dementia and talked about its prevention methods in an interview with Sputnik radio.
English: According to WHO data, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself as a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty navigating even in familiar surroundings.
Golosheikin noted that most often dementia is caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
On a behavioral level, the role of factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity is possible," he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disturbances, and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first symptoms, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate, and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"The discussion is ongoing that hearing loss could be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development," added the biologist.
For the prevention of disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
English: Previously, the professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Medical Genetics of the Federal State Autonomous Educational Institution of Higher Education RUDN University.

Egypt returned about 30,000 illegally exported artifacts from the country
Over the last 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return about 30,000 artifacts to their homeland, which were illegally smuggled out of the country.
On Saturday, December 11, the chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gawad, announced this during an broadcast on the Al-Hayat TV channel.
Since 2011, the Egyptian government has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
Only this year, 5300 ancient Egyptian civilization artifacts were discovered at the Museum of the Bible in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gawad clarified that all smuggled artifacts are registered in the archives.
Currently, the department employees are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists "track auctions around the world and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon their return, cultural valuables are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol for assistance in locating a bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun that was sold at an auction in London.
English: On July 4th, the auction house Christie's held an auction where a bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art piece was illegally exported in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amon, was kept in a private collection and had not been put up for auction since 1985.
It is unknown how the relic ended up in Europe.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of ancient monuments illegally exported from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers."
"Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, as Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent nation (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - that's how many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a distinct ethnic group, and the name of this group consists of two words!
The only thing uniting them is the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, reports Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the US, the Swiss bank does not provide its employees with corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank may review information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to address business matters with colleagues or clients.
The bank reserves the right to inspect mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it for holding a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote work mode, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that have been used for work-related purposes.
According to the newspaper, the bank management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the information about the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergey Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but extremely difficult for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego".
He is already beyond any literary associations, has spat on Imaginism, he is on his own, but well-known, in demand, occasionally strongly criticized by critics, even maliciously, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their hands.
Over the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are true masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, and the collection "Soviet Rus" was released.
And the main success - at the end of June of the 25th year, the State Publishing House concluded a contract with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
No contemporary poet has been honored like Sergey Alexandrovich; he is the first!
In addition, it promised very good money - according to the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles monthly for 20 months (for example, the factory director received 300 rubles per month, an engineer - 200).
In that year, the funds were needed more than ever.
Yesenin married Lev Tolstoy's granddaughter Sofia Tolstaya, and had to establish family life, support his sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seemed that life was getting on track, there was something to be happy about, but for him, everything is primarily painted in dark shades, as if the nightmare from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Yesenin) materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I am very and very sick.
I don't even know where this pain came from.
Either the wind is whistling
Over the empty and deserted field,
English: Whether, like a grove in September,
Alcohol scatters the brain.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin had significantly declined, looked bad, and was clearly ill.
English: More and more often, there are noisy gatherings and nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not only in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was ever made for Sergey Alexandrovich by someone, no reliable documents have remained.
Let's say, referring to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan, was recovering his health at a clinic near Paris under Professor Pyotr Gannushkin (Yesenin would return to him again two years later, this time in Moscow).
And here there is plenty of evidence of the poet's drinking bouts, scandals on this ground, and being taken to the police - scattered throughout dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20s, the poet's terrifying novel with the green snake rapidly developed.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin briefly settled in with his friend, the Imagist Ivan Startsev.
It's surprising, but despite his quite decent income, Yesenin never had his own housing in either Moscow or St. Petersburg; he always lived in rented apartments, hotels, or stayed with acquaintances.
English: Starcev recalls:
"He only came to spend the night, and in most cases, he was in an intoxicated, drunk state.
Once, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Yesenin fell on the stair landing...
Falling, he scratched his face and wheezed.
Having come to his senses a little, he began to cough incessantly, sprinkling the entire sheet with blood...
Yes, and even Yesenin himself, after his journey through Europe and the USA (there was Prohibition in the States at that time, but Duncan brought along a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
English: "I saw nothing there but taverns and streets...
I'm reaching the end and I've stopped memorizing people...
Well, and drank, of course...
English: And I drank because I was consumed by anguish.

Why didn't he tell his daughter that it's not a school?
Well, she will have a tail.
Well, so what?
Will retake.
Millions of students know this.

The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon" against the EU.
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon"
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland, Pavel Yablonsky, expressed the opinion that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The corresponding statement was made by the Deputy Foreign Minister in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus temporarily "stopped Lukashenko", but he is "actively searching for new ways."
Also, the Polish official is confident that now illegal migrants will be used as a weapon "in many parts of the world."
As reported by the website kp.ru, earlier the European Union has imposed the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they announced their readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve."
Minsk, in response, imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not for Senka's hat": when a velvet jacket turns a man into a laughingstock
At the secular events of 2021, velvet jackets dominated.
Perhaps, the first one to announce their new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
Back in September at the premiere of the movie "No Time to Die", he appeared in a velvet raspberry jacket and the traditional "Bond" bow tie.
Following his example, Prince William twice chose an unconventional attire, first wearing a green velvet jacket that did not conform to the royal dress code at The Earthshot Prize awards ceremony, and then opting for a more classic option at an event supporting the Royal Variety charity fund.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was also tried on by Lionel Messi.
The football player came to collect his seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same way.
AliExpress is already noting a growing demand for velvet men's blazers in Russia.
According to the data from the service's analysts received by "Gazeta.Ru", their purchases increased 1.4 times more frequently.
The most popular warm velvet jackets with lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue, and, of course, black.
The average price of such models ranges from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - they choose velvet suit sets less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next, and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets this season are represented in almost all brands - including Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desired model is considered to be Gucci, in which brand ambassador Jared Leto appeared at one of the premieres of the movie "House of Gucci."
When choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special thread interweaving technology, a dense fabric with a fuzzy outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget-friendly options are made of cotton or polyamide, but they also last for a shorter period, respectively.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, so such a jacket is perfect if you are going to a party or a festive event," explains Vakhoshkin. "It is also suitable for those cases when the invitation specifies a dress code of 'Black Tie' or 'Creative Black Tie'."
Another important criterion, the observance of which allows choosing in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first and foremost, should surround himself with the right advanced social circle with wealth, - believe the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Krasavchik Brammell". - Velvet jacket owners, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets."
They are simply invited to themed social events, where a dress code is always specified.
English: Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with equally festive items: classic trousers with creases, solid-colored shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, and cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Beau Brummell" are convinced: it will be inappropriate for an ordinary employee to appear in a velvet jacket at a corporate event, but if it comes to a "leader from among those who are in charge of this event," then - "yes", such an item is suitable for them.
If the employee is of a lower rank and their goal is the desire to move up in the complex hierarchy of the company or to get financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate it with the phrase "the hat isn't according to Senka," - believe the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous feelings about the voice.
This is an unnatural timbre, it strains so laboriously.
And it absolutely isn't associated with the nice face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of those around me.
But with all my heart, I wish you good luck in your life!
It's all about the money - alternative energy is well lobbied, meaning it is funded.
Billion-dollar investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has increased.
Traditional energy is also not at a loss - gas, oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are sold now.
High demand for fuel.
A penny is dripping.
And who's out in the cold then?
As usual - an ordinary customer.
Does the sheriff care about the Native Americans' problems?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who "slept through" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a decent wage.
I didn't see a single beautiful person in the photos in the article.
Simply mediocrity within the framework of average passengers.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it off to the whole car, then most likely no one will sit next to them.
But only due to mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauties (male and female)", but definitely not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who recognizes his slave position and fights against it, is a revolutionary.
A slave, not aware of his own slavery and languishing in a silent, unconscious, and wordless slave life, is simply a slave.
A slave, whose saliva flows when he smugly describes the delights of a slave's life and admires the kind and good master, is a serf, a boor.
The immunologist stated that re-vaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the "omicron" coronavirus strain.
Revaccination after four to five months may protect against the new Omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called vaccination in six months, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, "a very long period."
"With the previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure after five months, and for people with chronic diseases - after four," the expert said, urging to simultaneously deal with revaccination along with the vaccination campaign.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has had two vaccinations and a booster, or has recovered and been vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and then recovered, they have acquired 'hybrid immunity', meaning they have many antibodies and enough neutralizing ones," the expert clarified.
The "Big Seven" warned Russia of "large-scale consequences" in case of invasion of Ukraine
The "Group of Seven" countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France, and Japan) have released a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
In it, it is emphasized that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will be costly" for Moscow, but specific measures are not described in the document.
"We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military buildup and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine," the statement reads.
Furthermore, the ministers call on Russia to "de-escalate the situation, use diplomatic channels, and comply with its international commitments in terms of military activity transparency," which US President Biden discussed during a video call with the Russian President Putin on December 7th.
"We confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements with the aim of resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the foreign ministers of the G7 also stated.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have massive consequences and a serious price in response," they warn.
We confirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation in our joint and comprehensive response," the statement also said.
Earlier in the day, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss stated that Russia will face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting demonstrated the "united voice of the G7 countries," which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and which made it very clear that an invasion of Ukraine would have major consequences for Russia.
The Pfizer vaccine is considered 32 times less effective against the Omicron strain
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
English: Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have come to this conclusion, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 drug.
English: "We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant; however, this ability was significantly reduced against the Omicron variant," said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe illness when infected with the coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the influence of the Omicron variant on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the Omicron strain may cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The head of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense accused Germany of blocking NATO weapons supplies to Kiev
Head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany imposed a veto on Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles for defeating drones.
At the same time, it is noted that Berlin later softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the USA, the United Kingdom, Lithuania, and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz regarding the authorization of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany, Andrey Melnik, expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect arms supplies from Berlin during Chancellor Scholz's tenure.
According to him, the previous leadership of the FRG justified their refusal to provide arms by the risk of military escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite the "occupation by Russia" of part of the Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat is confident, Germany will maintain under the new chancellor as well.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kyiv expects assistance from Berlin in equipping the naval fleet.
In Ukraine, it is expected that Germany "will be Ukraine's partner in a technical sense," added the president.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chair of the German Green Party, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he advocated for the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

Revealed methods of returning money stolen through online stores
There are several ways to recover money stolen through online stores and avoid becoming a victim of fraud in the future.
Their findings were revealed by information security experts in a conversation with RBC.
Yes, to reduce the risk of significant losses when bank card information falls into the hands of wrongdoers, it is recommended to store the main funds on a card or bank account that is not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be put aside into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend having a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen during purchases at stores that do not use 3D Secure protection technology, it is possible to initiate a procedure for refunding the funds.
Within the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without using 3D Secure, responsibility falls on the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service, - clarified a representative of Promsvyazbank.
Expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, Arthur Zaremba, emphasized that the buyer has the right to submit a claim to the bank to dispute a fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition to this, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be disputed and the money can be returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves refund the customer if the order has not yet been shipped for delivery.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber, director of the Safe Internet League Ekaterina Mizulina reported that in 2021 alone, there were 11 thousand appeals concerning various fraud cases: from the sale of counterfeit documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints about online fraudsters.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss "Nord Stream-2" and EU legislation
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Warsaw for talks dedicated to the migrant crisis at the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream 2".
Although Scholz expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki stated that he will urge Scholz to oppose the "Nord Stream-2" project, which is intended to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravetsky, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it will help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.
The judicial system of Poland, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreements.
The European Court has fined Poland, establishing that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party "Law and Justice" violate EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation takes precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the US, did not take on public commitments to stop the work of the "Nord Stream-2" in case of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany about stopping the gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior US Congressional staffer reported on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but on Wednesday Scholz warned of the consequences if Russia violates the border of Ukraine, and this position was confirmed by representatives of the "G7" on Sunday.

English: Do you wash them once a year on Easter, or what? You have to clean them so thoroughly.
Simply do not let it get dirty.
The Ministry of Digital Affairs wants to present writers with residences.
In the future, the state will transfer federal property, inherited from the Union of Soviet Writers and the Literary Fund of the USSR, to the Fund for the support of Russian writers.
On its basis, writer's residencies will be created, as reported to the "Parliamentary Newspaper" by the Ministry of Digital Development, which will become the founder of the foundation.

The Chief Prevention Specialist of the Ural Federal District, Scientific Director of the Society of Preventive Medicine Specialists, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in an interview with URA.RU, said that Russians are now frequently using anticoagulants disorderly, even before vaccination against coronavirus infection.

There are citizens who, a week before vaccination, decide to start taking anticoagulants on their own initiative.
And during the preliminary examination before vaccination, doctors notice bruises.
He emphasized that it is extremely dangerous to take any medications without determining the cause of any symptom.

The plumber who found money in the wall of the church will receive 20 thousand dollars.
The plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the American state of Texas will be awarded a reward.
English: This is reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred in the large Lakewood evangelical church, where Pastor Joel Osteen preaches, promising that devout Christians can expect wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Coulli repaired one of the church toilets and discovered thousands of packages with money and checks under the thermal insulation.
He handed over the find to the church and, according to him, did not even receive gratitude from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done," - quoted by KPRC-TV.
Judging by all indications, the find is related to a theft that occurred in the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then, about 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in checks, which were stored in the church safe, disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
English: Nevertheless, a reward of 25 thousand dollars was announced for information about the criminals.
Justin Cowley could not claim this amount, as the validity period of the award had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which had previously allocated five thousand dollars for a reward and later received another twenty thousand dollars as a donation from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the honesty of the plumber.
He will receive 20 thousand dollars.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Osteen regarding the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic "as a real person".
That's why the attitude towards her is so negative.
And it's not about the fact that "she is financially much richer than all the scribblers," as they write here.
There are people who are even richer, but not everyone behaves as insolently, as provocatively, as this madam.

In China, a new case of human infection with the bird flu virus has been recorded
A new case of human infection with the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N6 virus has been confirmed in China.
English: RTHK radio station reported this, citing a notification from the Hong Kong health authorities, according to TASS.
A 68-year-old resident of the urban district of Huiyang in the southern province of Guangdong became infected after keeping domestic poultry on his property.
His condition is assessed by doctors as critical.
The first-ever human infection with the H5N6 strain of the virus was recorded in May 2014 in the southwestern province of Sichuan.
Since then, the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
In Brazil, citizens are required to present vaccination passports upon entry to the country
In Brazil, it has become mandatory to require COVID passports from those entering the territory of the state, a corresponding decision was made by Luis Roberto Barroso, a judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF).
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens with contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a vaccination certificate.
Also, the exceptions list includes people who have arrived from countries where the absence of a vaccine has been proven.
"The situation is even more serious, considering that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-carnival, and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow," Barroso noted.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities required unvaccinated tourists against coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
Revealed: A scheme for full protection against COVID-19
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of complete protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by administering an injection and using a nasal vaccine.
When applied intranasally, a large amount of immunoglobulin A is formed. This does not occur when the vaccine is administered by injection.
Immunoglobulin A protects the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we mostly produce immunoglobulin G (antibodies).
And if you administer both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But so far there is no decision about double vaccination," the medic explained.
The chief epidemiologist of the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in combination with injection is the possibility to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help because in this case, the body's defense, presumably, should be at its maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region, David Melik-Guseinov, stated that the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children would lead to a new surge in the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is the exact situation observed in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic arrived earlier.
Inna, um...
I used to talk to the male dog (who died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm home, food, affection, love, and games for a female dog in heat, then go ahead.
But the dog was well-trained and generally smart.
Chose my company and went home.
On the video is a method that works in 90% of cases.
Not taken out of thin air, believe me.
English: I stopped many owners from running after their dogs, even though they complained that there were 200,000 (Pomskies) running away. I would directly take them by the hand and lead them in another direction.
In the end, "200 thousand" was choosing the owner, not the little dog that was running somewhere out there.
In Europe, mass protests by vaccination opponents continue
In the Austrian capital Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and the authorities' plans to make COVID vaccination mandatory.
From February of next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros.
Spaniards, outraged by the authorities' healthcare policy, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held posters with the inscription "This is a false pandemic," "I will not get vaccinated."
A large protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a COVID certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and nightlife establishments.
English: The decision to introduce sanitary passports was made by the authorities of several regions of the country against the backdrop of an increase in the number of coronavirus infection cases.
In Luxembourg, over a thousand protesters demonstrated against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action started peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement.
A group of protesters started throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S., even in Wikipedia there is no single opinion on this matter.

WHO discovered "Omicron" in sixty countries already
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the new coronavirus strain "Omicron" has been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
English: The rates of the strain's spread were discussed in a WHO report.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is considering that it began to actively spread only since the end of November.
WHO expresses concern about the high rate of spread of the new variant of coronavirus.
English: WHO experts express concern that, according to preliminary data, the new strain may surpass the "delta" strain, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, in terms of spread, which is currently leading in all countries without exception.
Before this, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the Omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
In similar conclusions, they also arrived in the United Kingdom.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "Omicron" will displace "Delta" in the coming months.
And the number of infected people in Britain alone will be around 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially, at the moment, only a few hundred people in the Kingdom are suffering from the "Omicron" variant, and according to estimates, up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the Omicron strain, and at the peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals daily.
With what the British healthcare system will not be able to cope.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "Omicron" strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
About how the Russian "Sputnik V" vaccine reacts to the "Omicron" variant is still unknown - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the "Omicron" strain.
Why do we need to see the stages of aging?

Curious Squirrel, you are right, communication on the Internet is completely different, people interact easily and naturally, while during a personal meeting there might be nothing to say.
Yes, and seeing a person live, perhaps, is not what you expected, it didn't catch on - that's where the attitude comes from.
When one meets their person, then their views will change.
And again, the Soviet era is called the "time of demons."
Yes, back then people believed in God much more sincerely than they do today.
Yes, and they were brought up almost according to God's laws (love for thy neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What ideology prevails today - money at any cost.
Talkative people like Globa have little faith (in fact, none at all), but even if so, the time of demons came in the '90s...
Our St. Petersburg, or more precisely Leningrad communal apartment with Bolshaya Zelenina still maintains communication to this day.
Of course, we are not the closest friends, but we try to preserve the warmth of relationships with the older generation.
Perhaps it is related to the fact that there were no guests in the apartment, rooms were not rented out, and the blockade brotherhood was not canceled.
Unfortunately, we see each other more often at funerals.

And for what?
Brother pushed, did not calculate the strength?
And are you always so skillful that you never accidentally bumped into anyone and never injured yourself even once?

Russians warned of a new scammers' scheme
Malefactors have started looking for new schemes for fraud in video messages.
English: "Izvestia" reports on this with reference to experts.
According to Ivideon's Director of Products, Zaur Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is deepfakes.
In this case, scammers create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this neural network, it is possible to accurately reproduce the behavioral features of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that by using deepfake, malicious actors can call the victim's acquaintances via video call or create a video with the participation of a person's copy for distribution with the purpose of blackmail.
"Such forgeries can easily provoke bullying, as a well-informed malicious person can put people in ridiculous, dangerous, or compromising pseudo-scenarios," said the expert.
Leading Varonis systems engineer Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically, people trust others more when they can see them.
He emphasized that this may create specific risks in cases when it comes to technologies using video.
English: David, I will add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I bought all of this in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow for heavy makeup and wearing short skirts, showing stockings and tights on one's legs.
This is a province, but there WAS such a product in the store.
In big cities, even Muslim women wore makeup and showed their thighs.
Here is how it is in Dushanbe, it's a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are many fashionistas, but there is not enough of the same cosmetics.
Listed are five actions that can help prevent diabetes
Problems with blood sugar levels are some of the most common in the world.
However, some people do not attach much importance to this, and in vain.
Diabetes can lead to severe complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Yes, doctors recommend changing the drinking regimen - reducing the amount of various drinks and switching to regular water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet products increase blood sugar levels to a dangerous level when consumed in excessive amounts.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and storing them at home.
The occurrence of the disease is influenced not only by an improper diet but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, it is necessary to be physically active.
Experts advise to follow a low-carbohydrate diet.
A diet like this will not only help to lose weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, it is necessary to consume a lot of fiber.
Dietary fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the emergence of a feeling of fullness, the release of digestive juices, and the improvement of food absorption.

Dr. Pavlova talked about the "weekend migraine" in workaholics
Several factors can contribute to a worsening well-being on weekends.
The cause of feeling unwell after working days is often the "weekend migraine", according to the famous endocrinologist, PhD in medical sciences, senior researcher at the faculty of fundamental medicine of Moscow State University, and scientific director of the Clinic of Systemic Medicine, Zukhra Pavlova, in her Telegram channel.
According to her, workaholics suffer from this especially often, experiencing headaches, fatigue, and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that besides the accumulated fatigue over the week, there are quite a few objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to changing conditions.
On weekends, our life changes fundamentally.
"We sleep for a long time, lie on the sofa all day, most likely eat more, and drink less," the doctor argued. "A slight withdrawal starts due to the lack of coffee.
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and exhaustion.
An additional role is played by getting up late.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction called jet lag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
In order to determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes the most over the weekend.

South African scientists reported low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against "Omicron"
In South Africa, they reported a low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the "Omicron" variant.
Scientists from the South African Republic conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the Omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, its (neutralization level of "Omicron") corresponds to the (level of) vaccine efficacy at 22.5% against symptomatic infections, which casts doubt on the vaccine's ability to protect against infection, - says the study text published on the MedRxiv portal.
In this context, experts clarified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the Omicron strain of coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the United Kingdom, with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in common products?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
An excess of it in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that an unfamiliar word in a product's composition may indicate hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calorie content, composition, and glycemic index.
On the label, there could be several dozen names, essentially denoting sugar.
One of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
Also, there can be other hidden sugars, such as dextrose (sugar obtained from corn), levulose (fructose), molasses (black treacle), agave syrup, etc.
This is all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery products, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, bread, and so on.
As stated by Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and unprocessed foods, as well as pay attention to the label and the many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar vary in taste, but no matter what the ingredient is called in the product's composition - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
Calculating the exact amount of sugar is not easy, as one needs to take into account not only the amount of sugar specified by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc., initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
The new Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, stated that gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues its transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, by 2045 Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil, and coal, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role," said the Chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to maintain its commitment to ensuring that Ukraine transports Russian natural gas in the future, as this resource is currently of great importance for the energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the USA had issued a statement, in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation has been documented.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbok stated that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is ongoing.
According to the minister, during the coalition negotiations and discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline does not yet "comply with the requirements" of the European Union.

Hackers hacked the Twitter of India's Prime Minister
Hackers hacked the Twitter account of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Malefactors managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment method, and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
In Modi's office, they asked to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the premiere stated that Twitter responded quickly - access to the account was restored.
The Indian Prime Minister's page was already hacked in 2020, and there were calls to make donations to a fund using cryptocurrency.
At the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence.
In New Caledonia, the third referendum held on December 12th ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of New Caledonia residents voted against the independence of their territory during the referendum.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third voting became significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted "for" the independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "against".
The turnout was 43.90%, with over 80,000 residents of New Caledonia participating in the elections.
As the France-Presse agency comments on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt," as supporters of independence called on voters not to participate in the vote.
As initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago hinders a full-fledged and "fair" pre-election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, and in 2020 - 53.3%.
As the separatists stated, they do not recognize the results of the latest voting and will challenge them in the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to speak following the results of this referendum.
The issue of New Caledonia's independence has largely enlivened the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates have spoken in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is the "last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific Ocean."
"New Caledonia must definitely remain French," Eric Zemmour repeated several times.
A similar statement was made by the Republican candidate Valérie Pécresse, who, at the end of October, published an article in Le Figaro, urging the Caledonians to remain French.
From his side, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he will not take a position, "because it is not his responsibility".
Nevertheless, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed a "strong desire for the choice of the Caledonians to be the choice of France."
Sveta, oh, hello!
I was a little... quite rude to you, still feel awkward and ashamed.
Thank you for not turning away from my channel.

WSJ readers criticized the article about Russia and US relations
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized the article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of the relationship between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West allegedly sacrifices Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger coming from Moscow, and made a series of offensive statements about the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "present a united front against Russia".
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of an American professor.
"In this article, there is quite a lot of false information," RIA Novosti quotes a comment from one of the readers.
"Europe is not ours, to be "lost", and Ukraine is not our land.
USA and NATO allies will never engage in a nuclear war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine," - another one noted.

Ukraine will start producing next-generation jet-powered drones
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant, they will begin to create reactive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
On December 11, the freelance advisor to the head of the Ukrainian president's office, Alexey Arestovich, announced this.
That is, they are capable of acting against aerial objects, against other unmanned aerial vehicles.
Even against piloted aviation.
On them will be Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the body and the like," Dialog.ua quotes him.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA systems, Arestovich explained that they are about jet-powered, not piston unmanned aerial vehicles.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which surpass it "in all characteristics."
The first batch of UAVs is supposed to be produced by the factory at the end of next year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve, the Ukrainian General Staff classified the data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during the military operations of the Joint Forces in Donbass.
English: On December 6, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the construction of a modern military drone manufacturing plant has begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
English: On September 29, the company Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kyiv region, where personnel training, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs, will be conducted.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called this memorandum "a big and real step forward".
In the airport, two lions escaped from a container
In Singapore's Changi Airport, lions escaped.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
English: Two predators managed to escape from a container with seven lions that arrived on one of the airplanes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the escaped lions lay down on the roof of the container.
The animals could not move away from him due to the protective net installed nearby.
The standoff ended after the arrival at the airport of employees from the Mandai Wildlife Group, which manages all Singaporean zoos.
They immobilized the lions using tranquilizer darts and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier, it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and roamed the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, and no people were harmed.
Experts warned about the risk of cancer due to vitamin B9
Research shows that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express publication warned about this.
According to experts, there is substantial evidence that people who do not experience a deficiency in folic acid are at a lower risk of developing certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dose, on the contrary, promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, nutritionist Bet Kitchin advises monitoring the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if there is a significant deviation from this number in either a larger or smaller direction.
Kitchen recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid cereals with milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine named folic acid as a substance that slows down aging.
Since it, among other things, is contained in avocado, Fain recommended men over 50 to eat this fruit more often.
In the United Kingdom, by April, about 75,000 people could die due to the Omicron strain.
English: Forecasts by British scientists show that due to the spread of the Omicron strain of coronavirus, up to 75,000 people may die in England in the next five months if restrictive measures are not tightened during the winter.
English: The Guardian newspaper reported this, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), according to TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts, who are part of the scientific advisory group on emergency situations under the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, the country will register at least 25,000 fatalities due to the Omicron strain, with a total of around 175,000 patients being hospitalized.
At the peak of the infection, hospitals will admit more than 2,000 infected patients daily.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be required to prevent overloading the National Health Service if the omicron strain turns out to be more contagious than the delta variant, and existing vaccines cannot prevent infections," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK Health Security Agency informed that if the spread rate of the Omicron variant remains at its current level, around 1 million infection cases will be detected in the country by the end of the year.
At the same time, by mid-December, the Omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At the moment, 1,898 cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus have been detected in the United Kingdom, with 633 of them identified in the last 24 hours.
English: At the same time, on December 9, the head of the UK Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, pointed out that in reality, this figure could already be reaching 10 thousand cases.
English: I wanted to write some kind of smart comment, but I read up to this point:

Demand for superyachts increased by a quarter worldwide
Construction of superyachts this year and orders for the next year are breaking all records worldwide, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and fight against climate change.
In the global ship registry, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1,200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of fighting the consequences of climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress worth 50 million dollars or more will not decrease, writes "The Guardian."
However, their number is growing.
In this year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there hasn't been such a hype in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of getting infected on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If before all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the vast majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are held via Zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are accepting orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, just to have their yacht ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super-rich can afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
Sociologists say that the rich do not want to understand that in times of hardship, space travel, life on yachts, or flying on private planes cause irritation in society, because the elite do not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists urge governments to take action and propose introducing new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they understand that with such financial mobility, implementing this will be extremely difficult.
Meanwhile, not only the number of ordered super-yachts is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Out of 1200 vessels, 27 have a stern length of over 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Røkke is building a 183-meter long yacht called REV Ocean.
After being launched, this will be the largest yacht in the world.
On the yacht, there is a "moon pool" and also a submarine designed for exploring the depths of the sea.
On existing superyachts, helipads, open-air cinemas have become common, and on some of them, such as on McGregor's fighter yacht, there is a platform for martial arts. Richard Wilk, a professor of economic anthropology at the American University in Indiana, says that compared to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has symbolic significance, considering that there are just over 2,000 billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than the footprint of an average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the biggest polluter of the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission trace was attributed to his 162.5-meter-long yacht Eclipse.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the crew continues to pollute the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the order to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not elicit sympathy from others when they, like Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, complain via YouTube that there is no space to dock their gigantic vessels.
It is also difficult to understand her appeal to build marinas for ships over 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly alcohol dose has been identified, leading to the development of colon cancer
American scientists have determined what volume of alcoholic beverages per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
English: The Daily Express publication writes about this.
Experts have concluded that consuming four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, the risk of developing colon cancer is higher for moderately drinking men than for women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of the development of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a disastrous process for the organism.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child.
Many, or more precisely, all dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they do not realize how advanced four-legged pets are in reality.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to definitively determine how intelligence has developed in animals.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study shows that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The works of scientists were published in the Sciencealert edition.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, they know nothing about politics, economics, and art; however, they often manage to deceive their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show better results in understanding words of the human language, but there is not enough statistical data for accurate conclusions yet.
Yes, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and in terms of learning ability, they are not inferior to a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine, they prepared for the trade between the USA and Russia
USA and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine's entry into NATO, stated analyst Alexander Kochetkov in his article for the publication "Glavred".
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow plan to continue negotiations in the near future regarding the United States' guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "join wherever they want."
If you are offered something blatantly unacceptable, for example, selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you would not bargain but simply send off the proposer.
And in relation to Ukraine, a trade is being planned," wrote the analyst.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"The preparation is carried out covertly, quickly, and immediately moves on to offensive actions, rather than waiting for the group to be detected and counteracting forces deployed," he noted.
China stimulates the development of the railway transport industry
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the USA, Germany, France, and other countries at the 2021 China International Railway Transport and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition held in Zhuzhou city, Hunan province (Central China).
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, noted company representative Hou Zhao Wen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, ensuring increased reliability and performance of the rolling stock.
In the last six months, China has significantly increased the export of railway vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing the "Chinese speed."
In May of this year, the first Chinese-developed double-decker high-speed electric trains designed for export to Europe came off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will operate on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary, and other European countries.
In November, trial operation began for a metro train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey.
The train will move along the metro line, connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The movement along this metro line will be opened next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"The Chinese railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovative competitiveness," said Feng Yaosyan, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China International Trade Development Committee (CITDC).
"This industry represents the main competitive advantage of Chinese high-quality equipment manufacturing in the global market," said Fen Yaosyan.
After more than 60 years of intense work, conducting a series of independent research and development, China has created an advanced railway equipment manufacturing system, with a full range of auxiliary tools and large-scale production activities.
According to Fen Yasyan, the country ranks first in terms of electrification of railways and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheykin listed early signs of dementia in a conversation with Sputnik radio.
According to him, signs of future dementia may include forgetfulness, as well as a range of mild cognitive impairments, such as an inability to concentrate, plan, and a decrease in abstract thinking levels.
At present, there is a debate about whether hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development, the specialist said.
Golosheykin emphasized that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disturbances, and a lack of specific vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the cerebral vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that as of today, medical professionals do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, studying foreign languages and active communication can help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
Also, the WHO recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, however, their effectiveness and appropriateness are still discussed in the scientific community," said Golosheykin.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking," said Golosheykin.
Earlier, a UK dementia research charity reported that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40 and over.
Medical professionals identified early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered problems with vision, due to which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia that specialists have identified is aphasia - a condition in which a person cannot find the right words to convey what they want to say.
The neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs mental health treatment and rehabilitation abroad, said neurologist Otar Toidze to journalists, who is part of a medical council created under the Georgian Ombudsman.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
Stable problems include issues with mobility, coordination, and variability of character," said the specialist, noting that this does not go beyond the normative limits and now the former president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"We call this neurorehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia," noted Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a specialized institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
In the evening of December 7th, Saakashvili began to sabotage the reception of medical assistance after the penitentiary service staff subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to cancel the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

In Spain, protests were held against COVID passports
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protest actions were held against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate, reports the agency Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the event was approximately 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for visiting bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and night entertainment venues.
Many protesters came to the event without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respecting the citizens' choice.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required for entry to entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city declared a medical dictatorship, and vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, over 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected, and more than 88 thousand patients have died.
In Russia, it is also planned to introduce restrictions for the unvaccinated.
The government submitted draft laws on a unified QR code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit venues for mass events, cultural institutions, public catering facilities, and retail outlets by presenting either a certificate of vaccination or a recovered illness, or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for trips on trains and airplanes.

Steep Ascent: How the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international level resorts in the country.
In China, they hope that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to engage in winter sports, which will allow collecting the 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but will also contribute to the economic development of the underdeveloped remote provinces.
English: The Taivu ski resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the venue of the Winter Olympic Games, is becoming increasingly popular among the Chinese.
In addition to infrastructure construction in the region, greening work is also being carried out: workers are planting trees.
In the country, there are more than 700 ski resorts, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international level competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including in Zhangjiakou, there are often problems with snow.
The main long-term goal is to ensure comfortable and engaging vacations at Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regulars.
English: However, it is still far from that.
Advisor on the organization of the Games, Justin Downs, says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year in winter, more and more Chinese people head to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite significant changes, it will take many more years to create a skiing culture here, believes Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions are yet to be actively developed and to create the necessary infrastructure for recreation there.
70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunli, not far from the venue of the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chunli, and now none of the local residents suffer from unemployment.
In the country, more and more stores are opening that sell clothing and equipment for winter sports.

More than 500 million people worldwide may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, according to the WHO.
Over 500 million people worldwide may be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed down humanity's progress in achieving universal access to healthcare services, stated the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
In connection with the International Universal Health Coverage Day celebrated on December 12, WHO and WB have published two complementary reports.
In them, they noted that the pandemic has led to disruptions in the provision of medical services and caused excessive stress on healthcare systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of the population with immunization has decreased, and the mortality rate from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
In the WHO and the World Bank, it was emphasized that the pandemic has caused the "worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it more difficult for people to pay for treatment."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their own pocket."
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, and more than four billion people have virtually no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister disconnected from the "Summit for Democracy" broadcast at the request of the White House
English: The speech of Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technologies, Audrey Tang, during a panel discussion at the US-organized "Summit for Democracy" was translated into audio-only mode, as evidenced by the summit's recording on YouTube.
The Reuters agency, citing sources, claims that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to their report, the reason was a map in which Taiwan was marked with a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Mrs. Tan was created by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries of the world according to the level of civil rights protection.
Taiwan was marked in green as "free", while China, North Korea, Laos, and Vietnam were marked in red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the image on her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the discussion participants "do not necessarily express the position of the US government."
China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources note that the map demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister could conflict with the "One China" policy, which Washington adheres to.
One of the agency's sources stated that after the map demonstration, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Summit for Democracy" took place from December 9 to 10, with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate summit, the editor-in-chief of the "Novaya Gazeta," Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be given to charity.
Earlier today, Russian Deputy Security Council Secretary Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese sentiment."

The New Shepard spacecraft with six tourists on board made a suborbital flight
English: The New Shepard spacecraft from Blue Origin with six tourists on board completed a suborbital flight on Saturday, December 11th.
The journey, which was broadcasted on the company's website, lasted a total of more than ten minutes, after which the capsule with passengers descended to Earth, reports TASS.
The launch of the carrier rocket was conducted from a cosmodrome near the American city of Van Horn (Texas state).
The ship rose to an altitude of just over 100 km, and the space tourists found themselves in a state of weightlessness.
The launch vehicle itself successfully landed at the spaceport site.
On July 20, Blue Origin successfully carried out the first suborbital flight of the New Shepard spacecraft with passengers on board.

The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the PRC has issued a circular instructing to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities with land border checkpoints, in order to further prevent the import of infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the specified cities must provide a negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test result, obtained within 48 hours before departure.
Those who arrive in cities where land border checkpoints are located must take at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day when the relevant administrative units of the provincial level determine and publish the zones of the specified cities, up until March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities with land border checkpoints, and which meet certain conditions, can consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they talked about the "sad conclusion" in the relations between Russia and the USA
Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Sergey Ryabkov in an interview with "Izvestia" assessed the prospects of Moscow and Washington's relations.
He noted that the long path of interaction led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not start yesterday.
Unilateral negative predictability exists, but as for any prospects of improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion after a long journey that we have gone through with the current administration, Trump, and Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday," - the diplomat pointed out.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the US striving to impose its approaches on Russia on a multitude of issues.
The Deputy Foreign Minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, progress is not observed.
At the same time, Russia urges the United States to adopt a responsible approach to issues of international security and hopes that the messages will be heard and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, at a meeting with the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, stated that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the USA.
Virologist warns of the danger of nasal COVID vaccination outside of hospitals
Those who have received the nasal vaccine for COVID-19 may develop an allergy and may need medical assistance, which is why it is not advisable to organize the first vaccination points with this drug at airports and shopping malls.
English: TASS was informed by virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and head of the bionanotechnology, microbiology, and virology laboratory at Novosibirsk State University, Sergey Netesov.
Organizing vaccination points for nasal vaccines at airports and shopping centers is easier, but initially, I would do this only in medical institutions.
The fact is that there is a probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine; it is small, but it is preferable for a person to sit near the doctor's office after that.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that act literally within a minute or two, which can sometimes be very necessary," said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to consider vaccination in shopping centers when there is accumulated experience in using the drug.
He also emphasized that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important for it to reach the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine may not reach its destination if the recipient with a stuffy nose blows it out after the injection.

In the United Kingdom, 1,239 cases of the Omicron strain of coronavirus were recorded in a day - RT in Russian
In the last 24 hours in the United Kingdom, 1,239 cases of infection with the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus have been identified.
Sky News reports on this.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the "omicron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people became ill with the new variant of the infection in Scotland, and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people infected with the new strain of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom has reached 3,137.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in a pessimistic forecast, calculated that by April in England, due to the outbreak of coronavirus caused by the "omicron" strain, 75,000 people may die.
Peskov warned of the sufferings of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
English: Presidential Press Secretary of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continued "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
"Some restrictions against Russia cannot be imposed without experiencing suffering oneself," said the official representative of the Kremlin on the "Russia 1" TV channel.
Peskov claims that "everyone in the world understands this".
Earlier it was reported that the United States is considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles to dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, German Gref, is confident that this is impossible.

Residents of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third independence referendum in New Caledonia, an overwhelming majority of participants decided not to leave the territory of France.
On December 12, the French TV channel BFM.TV reported.
96.5% of those who voted were against independence.
Supported the independence from France, 3.51% of the residents of the archipelago in the south of the Pacific Ocean.
Annulled the results of 2.99% of ballots.
The voter turnout on this day was very low: about 55% of the archipelago's residents came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by the separatists' calls to refuse participation in the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to reschedule the referendum date.
In October 2020, the residents of New Caledonia in a referendum voted against independence from France.
In 2018, a referendum on the issue of independence was already held in the region.
The majority of residents supported the inclusion of the archipelago as part of France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20,000 kilometers away from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
There are about 270 thousand people living on the archipelago, and the territory is endowed with a special administrative-territorial status.
Between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia, there is an agreement from 1998, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice with a two-year difference.

WHO preliminarily considers "Omicron" to be less dangerous than "Delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily considers that the "omicron" variant is less dangerous than the delta strain of coronavirus.
At the same time, there is data on the decrease in vaccine effectiveness against the new variant of COVID-19.
According to the information on December 9, "Omicron" has been registered in 63 countries.
Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the Omicron strain's protein suggest a reduction in vaccine effectiveness against infection and transmission of the variant.
Based on preliminary conclusions from South Africa, it is assumed that the severity of the disease may be less severe than with the "Delta" variant, according to the WHO technical report.
The organization notes that so far all registered cases of Omicron infection in the EU are mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, according to preliminary data, the new strain spreads faster than the "Delta".
In Russia, two cases of Omicron variant infection have been registered.
They "were previously immunized," reported the Gamaleya Center.
Head of Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova stated that there is currently no reliable data to suggest that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios for Zelensky were named
English: Former MP of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four possible scenarios for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may lose the support of the West, and may also possibly make compromises on Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told about this in a publication on the Glavred portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called "a perfect storm," assumes that key Western countries will stop supporting Ukraine, having reached an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
Such a development of events will contribute to a deep crisis, which Kiev may face in 2023.
English: "Parallel to this, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <...> domestic protests and confrontation of the authorities with key FIGs (financial-industrial groups),"- added the ex-parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the situation to develop - "war against all."
This forecast will come true in case of high turbulence in world politics, during which Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to such a situation, the leadership of Ukraine may make compromises on Donbass, as a result of which internal confrontation within the country is possible.
At the end of summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former MP, is up to 50-55%.
The third scenario for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation between population groups disagreeing with Zelensky and the president, due to which it is possible to seize control over the power block and implement "populist initiatives".
During such a crisis scenario, Zelensky will begin the "reformation of power," added Denisenko.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the "father of the nation."
To this may lead some event, which will become a strong shock for society.
"The event must be large-scale enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine," said Denisenko.
Such a development of the situation is possible due to a natural disaster, a technological catastrophe, or aggressive actions by Russia, according to the former deputy.
In this context, the Russian side has already repeatedly denied any possibilities of an "attack" on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that it is specifically the Ukrainian authorities, NATO, and the USA that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, the data from the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president has dropped to a record low, reaching 19.3%.
This is the lowest indicator since his election as the head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the case of the upcoming presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% would cast their vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for the country's ex-president, Petro Poroshenko.
In this case, among all respondents, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

Thank you to the author for the story about the great sportswoman, I didn't know that Elena Shushunova had passed away, it's very saddening to find out such things.
I remember how I was rooting for her at the Olympics in Seoul, for us, residents of the Primorsky region, it was live broadcast, real time.
Such a heat of passions, emotions were off the scale, I remember the joy when Elena won.
They also rejoiced in the other victories, as they cheered for Salnikov, for the soccer players, for all the Soviet athletes of that time.
Once on TV, I saw a documentary about one of the Central American countries, and there they rolled watermelons up the ramp onto the ship's deck, like barrels.
The watermelons were of monstrous size.
In my youth, I worked many times on harvesting and loading watermelons in the Astrakhan region and never encountered watermelons weighing more than a pood.
Buying watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the garden and not earlier than the beginning of August.

The lower part of the cup is reinforced with inelastic transparent fabric.
The lateral inner part of the cup, in the area of the strap attachment, is reinforced with non-stretch fabric in the fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is precisely this element that prevents the lace from stretching.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated thanks to the scalloped edging along the neckline and under the bust.
Vertical bones on the side panels made of single-layer microfiber prevent the fabric from twisting in large sizes.

Arrested for the action on Red Square, the poet said: "For quoting Yevtushenko, they give 10 days, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student from HSE (Higher School of Economics) was detained at Red Square with a poster that had the hashtag #poetofrussiaisgreaterthanpoet written on it.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
English: A protocol was drawn up for Alexander on the administrative article for the repeated violation of the order of conducting public action.
English: The first time he was detained was on January 23rd at Pushkin Square, during a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, as currently the interest in it, unfortunately, has been lost, to the decline of overall culture in Russia, as well as the small hope of inspiring unknown poets to write their poems on the internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We got in touch with the young poet to clarify the circumstances of his detention and to reveal in more detail the message of his work.
How were you treated by police officers during this and previous detentions?
What were they asking in the department, how did they comment on your action?
This time, the employees were more professional, making the detention as polite as possible, which might sound funny in some contexts of this word.
On Pushkinskaya, the OMON officers took action, and they did so harshly.
English: They asked in a standard way, about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if not approvingly, then understandingly.
Except for the inflatable monkey house that was blown to all 4 sides, everything was extremely correct, but I knew what I was getting into.
And if after the event under this hashtag people start writing their own poems, even if it's just a few people, I will not have spent these 10 days in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak privately in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe if you want.
And at public and official events, they speak in the language of the surrounding people so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through a translator.
This is just a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian fluently, yet still resorts to the help of a translator.

Researchers explained how potatoes help in combating age-related disorders
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements, which contribute to improving blood circulation and reducing cholesterol levels.
In the root vegetable, there are vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic acid, and pantothenic acid.
All these elements help the body's systems function properly.
In addition, potatoes help in combating age-related disorders.
Thanks to its high fiber content, it is beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular consumption, it can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, it is better to stew or boil the root vegetable rather than frying it in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express publication warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other high glycemic index products.
These are carbohydrate-containing products that quickly break down into sugars, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic beverages, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned about a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in private subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the current deficit in production can only be replaced by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from Yandex search results
Candidates for elimination
In 2015, the copyright holders from the "RAEC/Media" cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate websites in the Runet, and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, the general director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive, partly thanks to regular changes of the domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both "Yandex" and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Squid Game" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan - an original series from the largest video service in Russia, ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto", but judging by the video quality, this is a so-called "camrip" (a pirated copy of the film recorded in a movie theater).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univer. 10 Years Later" from TNT channel (part of "Gazprom-media") is available.

Wall lamp Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara.
A wide circumference, framed by "molecules" of light, provides the most uniform and bright illumination of the space.
"Atomic" or "molecular" design, reflecting the nature and natural essence of each object, remains relevant and allows for advantageous placement of accents in the interior.
One of the characteristic features of such lamps is the weightlessness of the structure.
Due to the thin, almost invisible cables that are adjustable in height, it creates the feeling that the chandelier is floating in the air.

Dimaks Micro Ultimate mattress, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient because it has two different surfaces in terms of softness - high stiffness and slightly above average.
The product consists of only high-quality and premium fillers, which have proven themselves exclusively from the best side.
Springs: in the center of the model, there is a block of independent "micro-package" springs installed.
This means that there are 2000 springs allocated per sleeping space, which operate fully autonomously.
It is their functioning that provides a unique pinpoint adjustment.
The "MicroPacket" is the highest frequency spring block among the entire variety of "Dimaxa" spring blocks, therefore it possesses a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: Above and below the springs, there are combinations of coconut coir and natural latex layers.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has latex, then the other has coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long carried the status of a classic, as it provides the mattress with not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If the coir provides proper back support, then the latex allows the surface to adapt to the shape of a person's body.
Cover: The model comes in a quilted knit Aloe Vera cover.
According to the client's wish, it can be made either removable or stationary.
English: The overall height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load for the sleeping area is 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: warranty period - 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
Orthopedic foam, which is used in the mattress, has a CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, reported "Aktualnaya Kamera" on Sunday.
The goal of the missions starting in five years is to assess the habitability of Venus' clouds, and then to search for life there.
For the project, Tartus scientists proposed instruments for measuring acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
Until now, it was assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, were too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally a Earth-type planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus is expected to arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question will be - is it similar to earthly life or is it different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that terrestrial life did not begin on Earth.
If it differs, then perhaps it will become more likely that life originated on Earth," - said the leader of the Estonian project team "Venus Life Finder" Mihkel Pajusalu.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The topic of metaverses became popular in the fall of this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
And so, businesses in Russia, just like in the whole world, will invest in creating their own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions in the context of the pandemic, as people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is a consequence of the business striving to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models to them.
With the third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art, and even money are converted into a digital format.
Anya, you are right, changing one's diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you no longer want something too fatty and harmful.
Of course, we will have traditional Olivier salad and herring under a fur coat at the holiday, but nobody forces me to overeat everything at once.
You can eat it with a spoon, give it a try - and that's enough.
After all, there are indeed ten days off ahead, so you can prepare any delicious and healthy dishes.

British economist unable to provide forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill could not give a forecast for 2022, as in his opinion, such attempts would result in failure.
About this, he wrote in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability, and any trend may change the course.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and in second place is inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the increase in prices of goods is temporary or not.
As the specialist pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of infinite generosity of central banks had outlived itself" and it was time to return to relations where interest rates taking inflation into account would correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that, against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policy could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as the increase in poverty levels and climate change, O'Neill summarized.
Earlier, the head of the Department of Global Studies at "Otкрытие Инвестиции" (Discovery Investments), Mikhail Shulgin, reported that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate in 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar exchange rate, Shulgin named the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, the dynamics of oil prices, and concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Forced to agree.
But one thing is pleasing: if you compare yourself with yourself, then there were fewer containers five years ago.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
By the end of 10 months in 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than for the same period last year, according to statistical data from the Russian Automotive Market Research Agency (NAPI).
To understand the scale - a similar amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the government to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
In the past September, at a meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization countries, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
On the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia leads in terms of revenue.
In the first 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars for a total of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than the previous year.
At the related Kia brand Hyundai, the growth is even more significant - over 35%, and the revenue from car sales is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In the leading positions, this brand is also in terms of increasing the average weighted price of a car - for the year, Hyundai's price has increased by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - the dynamics of appreciation were stronger only for Changan, Chery, Geely, and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, the sales volume of Korean brands did not grow so significantly: according to the statistics of the Automanufacturers Committee of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars during the same period than a year earlier.
English: Hyundai - almost 12%.
Closing the top three in terms of sales volume in monetary terms is the Japanese Toyota - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand for 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
Following the Japanese is Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has experienced an increase in both sales volume (by 37%) and the average weighted price of a car (almost 28%, up to 8.2 million rubles).
"At Mercedes-Benz, we are seeing both good sales growth and an increase in the average price - more, for example, than at BMW - which leads to a greater growth in financial capacity," explained NAPI General Director Tatyana Arabadzhi.
At the pace of sales growth, Chinese brands demonstrate fantastic performance, also significantly increasing their financial capacity this year.
English: The Russian Lada, in terms of revenue growth dynamics, demonstrates average market indicators (plus 28%). Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand over 10 months.
At the level of last year in terms of financial capacity are companies whose car sales in units in 2021 fell: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, and Nissan.
UAZ is even at a loss - in 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand, compared to 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of auto components and disruptions in production that have engulfed the entire global automotive industry, car companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AvtoVAZ" has increased the cost of Lada models seven times in a year, with the latest price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurring at the end of November.
Regularly rewrite price tags for their products and other car manufacturers.
The volume of the Russian car market in monetary terms will continue to grow - in addition to the deficit of cars, inflation and the desire of automakers to make up for past losses contribute to this, experts believe.
In conditions of a car deficit, I think that many car manufacturers were even able to partially shift the costs of past periods, which they could not include in the price of cars before, onto the consumer.
English: Analyst of "VTB Capital" for the automotive industry Vladimir Bespalov says.
I believe that in terms of finances, car manufacturers are feeling very good right now, maintaining high sales margins.
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in car prices, which has been observed throughout 2021, as prices for new cars are rising faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long-term perspective, the market will grow both in terms of quantity and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the increasing complexity of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
With the growth of supply, opportunities for increasing prices will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the next year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down. Car manufacturers will be able to receive their income due to volumes, notes independent automotive consultant Sergey Burgazliev.
Considering the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now striving to generate the most profit from each sold car, notes Burgazliev.
An increase in the volume of machine production is not expected for at least the next six months, while in Russia, the hype is fueled even more by citizens' uncertainty about the future.
In the context of the current market situation, cars have turned out to be a decent object for investments - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for a higher initial cost, states the expert.
Biden commented on the redeployment of US military to Ukraine in case of Russia's invasion
The US leadership has never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in case of a "Russian invasion."
English: U.S. President Joe Biden made such a statement.
"Such plans never existed," stated the head of the White House, responding to a journalist's question about whether the US had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in case of escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
In doing so, he emphasized that the US and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in case of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the US will deploy forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Estonia).
"We will have to direct more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries in relation to which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia" - stated Biden.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, emphasized that Moscow has no intentions to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in Kyiv's use of combat drones supplied by Turkey, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."
I immediately leave such interviews.
If at the interview they already want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink some incomprehensible swill and also wash a cup - it's scary to imagine what will happen at work.

If a scammer calls from a similar number, posing as a "Ministry of Internal Affairs employee" or another law enforcement agency, it is not effective to hang up immediately, and most likely, you will not have time to add them to the blacklist.

The film of Alexander Sokurov's student received the European "Oscar" for Best Editing
English: The Oscar-nominated Russian film "Unclenching the Fists" has won the European Film Academy award (also known as the "European Oscar") in the category of "Best Editing", reports "Moskovsky Komsomolets".
The jury of the competition, voting online due to the complicated epidemiological situation, evaluated the outstanding craftsmanship of the film's creators.
The maximum number of awards this time was received by the film "Quo Vadis, Aida?" by Jasmila Zbanic (Bosnia).
The main heroine of the film is a UN mission interpreter who tries to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
