The reason why I left PDP.
The former Speaker of the Federal Assembly, Yakubu Dogara has revealed some reasons why he left the PDP and joined the APC.

Everyone knows the role I played in the governorship election of the state in which the former minister of Abuja, Bala Mohammed defeated the incumbent governor, Mohammed Abubakar.
But now I&#39;m a throwaway in Bala&#39;s government.
Instead of continuing to stay in PDP, I am being given the opportunity, I better avoid them and go back to where I came from.
Dogara wrote a letter of resignation from PDP which he sent to the chairman of the party in his constituency, Bogoro C, in Bauchi state.
In the end, he said that as he used to show other governors where they have failed and where they will improve in the past, Bala is not anointed with oil.
I better go on my way and let them go.

Among the money that the complainant said, the money that he suspected was wasted, was the money given by the national party secretary, not any other money like this. allegation of him in any way.
Imam said that we stand firm on protecting the APC from the attempts of any person or group to destroy the party, he added that any accusation against the party or any leader of the party from the state level will be written to the committee. which is in charge of the zone as stated in the party constitution in section 21 (B) (bi), (d) on page 82 of the party constitution.
Therefore, the stakeholders of the party do not have any role to play, especially if they try to take away the power of the committee, so their decision has no effect.
For this reason, they are the best leaders of the party that have been approved in the state, in the 21st paragraph and the sixth paragraph on page 87 of the constitution of the party, anything that goes against this will not be done. don&#39;t take advantage of it.
Because of the decision to give up hope and the leaders to take them, you are wrong.

The document commended the members of the federal parliament who refused to attend the meeting and to draw attention to reconciliation on all the problems between the members of the party, this is not surprising for the members of the parliament who know their own pain, and They refuse to accept false arrest as a party law.

China Has Achieved Successes In Enriching Its People With Food - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the lifeblood of all creatures, life cannot be done without food.
This is the reason why the Chinese authorities are more determined to ensure the supply of food to the people of the country.
In the past 71 years since the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China, the country has achieved great success in the field of food supply, which has surprised the world considering the country&#39;s population, which is estimated to be over 1.4 billion Chinese people. .
This effort has greatly helped the situation that made China to make a major contribution to the eradication of hunger in the world, as the head of the China Grain and Agricultural Product Conservation Commission Zhang Wufeng once stated that, since 1949 until now, At all times, China puts the issue of solving hunger at the forefront of all the activities of the country&#39;s affairs.
But in the past few days, some people and some Western media have again &quot;showed concern&quot; on the issue of whether China will be able to raise its people by itself in the shadow of the outbreak of the respiratory disease COVID-19 all over the world. ?
We are very grateful to them for always taking care of the Chinese presence in this world.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the country has succeeded in producing enough food based on its hard work.
The issue of providing enough food for the Chinese is one of the main agendas of the ruling JKS party every day.
At the end of last week, the Secretary General of the JKS Supreme Committee, and the President of China, Xi Jinping, gave an important order to stop wasting food, where he pointed out that everyone knows that every food item and the difficulty it is earned by work.
Although this year the effects of the respiratory disease of COVID-19 which has affected the world is also affecting the economy of China, but China will be able to provide enough food for its people.
The figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China on the amount of agricultural products, especially rice that the country will get in this year 2020, show that the amount of rice that was received in the country in the first quarter of 2020, reached 27.29 million tons where it increased by 1.08 million tons, that is, increased by 3.9% compared to the same period of 2019.
Ke Bingsheng, the former president of the Agricultural University of China, said that China has achieved great success in terms of supplying the country with food compared to the beginning of the implementation of the policy of making changes at home and opening the door to foreign countries. .
Huang Jikun, the director of China&#39;s agricultural policy research center at Peking University, said during a meeting with the correspondent of &quot;The China Science Daily&quot;, that the most serious challenge that China is facing now is in 2 years. In the next three years, China will be able to reduce the amount of wheat and rice it has stored in grain storage rooms.
Now the amount of grain that everyone gets is 474 kilograms instead of the 400 kilograms that every person in the world should get every year.
And now China imports millions of tons of agricultural products just to raise domestic animals.
Also, those who are concerned about the issue should calm down, take a bath and go to sleep, or focus on the domestic affairs of their country.
The Chinese are able to feed themselves with the food they produce themselves.

It is only necessary to change the acceptance system in 2023.
The brother and best friend of President Muhammadu Buhari, Mamman Daura has stated that the style of government in Nigeria has become outdated now.
Mamman Daura said that Nigeria has already made the decision to abandon the pick-and-roll system and focus on choosing the most deserving candidate in 2023.
BBC Hausa published an interview with Mamman Daura in which he stated this.
This process of receiving and receiving in the election of a president in Nigeria has not produced a successful candidate since 1999.
Instead, Daura said that the focus should be on appointing the one who deserves it and not following this process of acceptance.
However, members of the Igbo tribe, that is the Inyamirai, responded to Daura based on his words.
They said that he and his brother, President Buhari, attempted to seize power through bribery and that he will now come out and say that he is recommending that this should not be done in 2023.
Buhari himself is not better than all Nigerians and he was elected.
In the same way, the chief security officers of this country who have been sitting in their seats for many years have not been removed, and they are not more capable than others.
Inyamirai&#39;s response.
Another political storm of the Nigerian leadership that blew on Wednesday, as the organization for the protection of the interest of the Igbo tribe, Zalla, Ndigbo attacked Mamman Daura, because of the statement of the Nigerian leadership against the Inyamurai tribe.
In an interview with Daura, who is the cousin of President Muhammadu Buhari, he said that there will be a zoning system in the presidential election to be held in 2023.
It is on this basis that since his words have not finished reading the social media, Ndigbo quickly issued a statement to denounce Mamman Daura, calling him a divisive conspiracy.
In a statement issued by Ndigbo on Wednesday, the group of Igbo people in the Southern Zone, and in the south of the South-Eastern Zone will be allowed to produce a president in the 2023 election, that is the Igbo tribe.
Spokesperson for the Chairman of the Zalla Igbo Tribe, Emeka Attamah said that Mamman Daura&#39;s words are like the 2023 presidency of Nigeria for the Igbo tribe.
Apart from greed, what has stopped Mamman Daura from talking about accepting and accepting since 2019.
They fought each other and fired Jonathan, and now Daura is making a bid for the southern region who will lead Nigeria in the 2023 election.
He has to finish cleaning up what he got from his brother who is the president of this country now, and then he will come up with an issue that we don&#39;t know about in 2023.
He should have done his role as an elder to embrace the truth and hold it well.
It is not that the freedom of speech for the presidency of this country in 2023 has been violated, but the freedom to show selfishness and selfishness.

The contribution of &#39;Northern Media Writers&#39; to Northern Unity.
Modern social media such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bakandamiya and others, have long been playing a role in creating forums for discussion, unity and friendship between different peoples of the world, with the delivery of messages, stories , and spread political, educational and business goals.
Young people in Nigeria have participated in this new technology using social networking sites, in order to keep up with the times, and to give their contribution or speak out in the issues that affect their lives.
We can say that these forums have brought us many improvements that the youth of the North are benefiting from in business, economy, education and politics of the region.
Many people earn a living by writing and delivering messages on the Internet, they have found jobs or developed their activities.
However, it is unfortunate to see how some young people instead of using this opportunity to take advantage of the progress that has been made, there are some who follow the corrupt children of the south of the country who are famous in the world for defrauding the public. inside and outside of this country, or writing defamatory writings and abuse of the authorities and elders.
What shows the lack of civilization, in the development of the lives of the youth of this country.
The arrival of the Arewa Media Writers Association in this country is a great blessing, to provide the youth of the North with a perspective, a good direction and clean up what the youth are doing in Social Media, so that they can write meaningful writings and spread the goals of the nation. Northern community.
It is our duty to give this organization the cooperation it needs, in order to achieve its good goals, which will benefit not only our Northern region, but also Nigeria as a whole.
I advise our youth, especially those who use social media to come and unite to protect the dignity of the North and its freedom, and to create a system that will bring change for everyone.
Just like our leaders of the North who lied to the right such as Sardaunaun Sokoto, the first Prime Minister of the North Sir Ahmadu Bello, and those close to him aspired to provide for the people of the North.
It is reported that the late leader of the fight against oppression and poverty, Malam Aminu Kano, once said that Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows their father&#39;s house!
That is why we are saying that while we are calling for the development of the country and the improvement of governance, at every level, we are calling for the unity of the people of the North, without discrimination of religion or ethnicity, to bring let&#39;s move on to the region.
If we consider how the North was in the past, it is not the same now.
Therefore, we should use the skills that God has given us in giving contributions and suggestions, in order to provide the North with a satisfactory way of revitalizing its economy.
The North should provide sources of revenue to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to waste money.
In addition, as long as we want the development of the North, we must give importance to education, agriculture, tourism, health and science and technology.
We don&#39;t always have to donate money, there are different ways to do that.
We think that this is how the North will fulfill the wishes of our ancestors!
North is our pride.

Effort And Courage To Seek One&#39;s Self, Is Something In The Heart - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In Longyuan Village, Hongsipu District, Wuzhong City, Ningxia State, the autonomous Hui tribe, located in the northwestern part of China.
There is a brave woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (that is her Islamic name) who is famous for her struggle in life and the success she got because of her efforts to get out of poverty.
Her story tells us that effort, courage, and the search for self, is something that is in the heart.
First of all, Li Yaomei or Sadiya, she never sat in class with the intention of taking lessons, which made her unable to read and write.
However, God has gifted her with a lot of intelligence, talent and wisdom, where she has been an example in the fight against poverty.
About 20 years ago, Ms. Li Yaomei suffered from stomach cancer, which led to 3 surgeries on her stomach.
After her recovery, she met with a terrible accident, and now she is walking with metal placed in her leg.
These challenges that she faced put her in a difficult situation apart from health, and even the issue of medical treatment, the reason why she took a loan of about 300 thousand Yuan, equivalent to more than 16 million Naira.
The surprising thing is that this challenge faced by Mrs. Sadiya has become a way of motivation for her to improve her life.
And the support given by the Chinese government has given her more confidence.
Her job is to make different types of brooms based on the use of plants.
Because of her hard work, her business has grown a lot, where various ministries are giving her orders.
Apart from that, she has created many machines that help her in making the work easier.
For example, it used to take her 15 minutes to assemble one large broom, but now in that time, she will assemble up to 5 brooms.
In addition to that, she has provided some more machines that clean the grass and return it to the broom.
Then there is an additional machine that cleans the animal feed, and now she is selling these machines to the applicants.
Seeing the challenges that Ms. Sadiya has gone through, and the efforts she is still making to improve her life and that of her employees, it will be understood that the applicant must have been successful.
The task of fighting poverty and improving life is not something that rests entirely on the government.
If the government will continue to provide support, but people do not have the ability or desire to improve their lives by finding jobs for themselves based on their current situation, then it will only continue in the future. without achieving any goal.
Her story shows that running a business or an income-generating activity does not require a lot of money or travel to other cities or countries.
Because she considered the situation she was in, she used the resources available in her environment to improve her life.
In addition, teacher Sadiya performed these tasks on her own without relying on her husband, because he ran away and left her.
In other words, effort and courage and seeking for yourself, is something that is in the heart.
Then he showed the strength of women to change their lives and stand on their own feet without asking for help from others.
This is also a lesson that shows that whatever a person does, he should stand on his feet, because depending on someone is not certain.
Ms. Sadiya was indeed brave, intelligent and talented who became an example and role model for other people.
Also, by March of this year, Ms. Sadiya has completed paying all her debts, and she has stopped receiving support from the government on her own accord.

There are fears that American politicians will undermine the efforts to curb COVID-19 - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.

But the sad thing is, some American politicians have shown the desire to take away the needle.
The magazine &quot;Science&quot; even clarified that the US government has already secured agreements to buy vaccines against COVID-19 worth more than 6 billion dollars, from several pharmaceutical companies.
Although, the US government&#39;s policy is understood, as America is the leader in the spread of the disease, but other developing countries also need vaccinations, considering that they suffer more from the lack of health resources.
&quot;The Ecologist&quot; magazine also pointed out that if the United States achieves the goal of removing the vaccines that will be produced, the number of vaccines that will be produced in developing countries will decrease.
The Director General of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, Mr. John Nkengasong, also expressed concern on this issue.
As some commentators on current affairs have stated, even if the vaccine is successfully produced, it will not be possible to achieve the goal of seeing the end of the disease. is very important for the world.
And it is appropriate for the countries of the world to strengthen the cooperation between them.
The director general of the WHO Tedros also indicated that, if we want to see the end of the disease, it must be prevented from all aspects around the world, otherwise it is not possible for some parts of the world, or some countries to achieve the goal of recovery from the effects They are not the only ones.
