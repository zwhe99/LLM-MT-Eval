Was the Destiny Plan in "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny" an eight-point plan for Durandal's rejection of Talia?

It's stuff like that that makes me not want to watch TV anymore...
I mean, does that mean that comedians are now impossible? TV is all about comedians.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there were quite a few times when the staff would giggle in the background when they were saying something particularly funny.
It's creepy to see people laughing at something that's clearly not funny, and then saying, "I'm a successful comedian, so I have to laugh at everything I say.
But if the staff doesn't laugh, it puts the comedian in a bad mood, and I guess that's not good for business relations.
Like the old black companies, the industry is very much like an athletic club, and some comedians' egos are so big that they usually behave in an unpleasant manner, or else they would not be able to make a living.
On the other hand, there are a lot of comedians who always say, "Don't underestimate comedians," as if they are exaggerating the difficulty of their own work.
I know my income is pretty low until I start selling, but I don't want to be told every time I'm a comedian as if I'm at the top of the top of the list of jobs that make my job a moot point.
It sounds like nothing more than a glorification of one's own career and a justification for the laughing comedians' too high position in the media and society.
To be honest, the industry I work in has some pretty tough parts, but it seems like the things that touch the geisha world are becoming more and more impossible.
I'm sorry I complained so much.
I felt like I had to let it out like farts or else it would be bad for me...

Ikemoto Brush Kogyo Mail Order
Hairbrush assortment!
Samples given to purchasers.
The product I ordered from Tsukumo NetShop was replaced without my permission.
Summary: I ordered a wireless mouse that was on sale at a discount, received a wired version of that mouse, and was told to send it back if I wanted a refund.
I know this is more of a mail order problem than a home-built PC topic, but I'm not convinced by any means, and it's a well-known place, so I'll put it here.
It all started when I found an MSI wireless gaming mouse on sale for 3,280 yen (link to the fishtrap) at the Tsukumo NetShop's Tsukumo Day sale that started the previous Friday.
In the store, the wired version was the same price, so I also checked the page for the wired version, considering the possibility of a price error, and it was 5,071 yen (link to fish page), so I ordered it, considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
I received the order email successfully and the shipment email the next day.
The name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was mentioned within these two emails and in the purchase history on My Page.
I assumed at this point that I would receive the wireless mouse I ordered because I was not notified of the mistake or notified of the cancellation between the order and shipment.
Here's the thing, a few hours after the shipment, I got an email saying that there was an error in the registration of the item.
According to that email.
* The wireless version was sold at a special sale price, but it was actually the wired version.
* We already ship wired mice,
1. Refuse to receive and cancel all
2. Return mouse only for a refund.
3. Use a wired mouse as it is.
Choose your response to
The product pages for the wired and wireless versions are separated, and the purchase history, email, and delivery note say the wireless version, but they replaced the wired version with the wireless version and sent it to me without permission.
Isn't it terrible that they send you something different from what you bought without your consent, and then ask you to send it back if you want a refund?
Please lend me your wisdom, because I want to hit back in some way, whether I finally accept a refund or not.

Isolated Twice... Typhoon and Heavy Rain Leak Only Bridge to District, Residents Triple Stockpile of Food in Fukushima Prefecture (Fukushima TV)
Yoshiro Matsumoto, Kochihara district, Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture.
A major impact on the lives of eight people in three households was the typhoon that hit eastern Japan in 2019.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: "At first, I was like, 'Are you serious?
The Kochihara Bridge, the only road leading to the Kochihara area, was washed away by the East Japan Typhoon, leaving 11 households and 30 residents of the area in isolation.
The residents, forced to cut off their water supply, continued to use the JR railway bridge, which is normally closed to traffic, to carry necessary supplies.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: "Normally, I could drive to my yard, but when I got out of my car there, I had to carry it in my hand or on my back and walk across the railway bridge to get here, so I felt how much I appreciated the transportation and the car. The area was again isolated for several days until a temporary bridge was built.
Although it has been more than two years since the disaster and restoration work has progressed, Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures to apply the lessons learned.
Yoshiro Matsumoto : "I think there are about 10 cases.
For the time being, I wanted to make sure we had enough food for two or three days." We have about three times as many canned goods, cup noodles, and other foods that can be used as emergency rations as we did before the disaster.
Misako Matsumoto: "I felt again that it is not someone else's business, and that everyone should have a little stockpile because you never know when a disaster might befall you.
To remember the lessons learned, the town began its own initiative in 2021.
Ryuichi Takahashi, Director, Education Division, Yamatsuri Town: "We have announced that we would like to establish "Yamatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day" and make October 12 a day to think about disaster preparedness from next year onward.
I think we are more aware than ever that the unexpected can happen.

Be careful when purchasing an existing home!
The Pitfalls of the Building Condition Appraisal System (Diamond Online) - Yahoo!
The "Building Condition Appraisal" system, newly established to revitalize the used home market, has been enjoying brisk transactions in used homes.
Prices for both houses and condominiums are rising, and the remodeling market is also expanding.
While the Corona disaster has increased the preference for homeownership, the soaring prices of "station-front, near station, directly connected to station," "large scale," and "tower" properties are concentrating their popularity, and the number of relatively inexpensive new properties is decreasing sharply.
However, compared to overseas markets, Japan's share of existing (pre-owned) housing distribution is still at a low level.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) partially revised the Building Lots and Buildings Transaction Business Law and started building condition surveys, so-called inspections, for the purpose of safe and secure used housing transactions (https: / /www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900. pdf ) .
This is a system under which an architect familiar with housing checks the current condition of the property and the condition of the building, including deterioration, and compiles a report, which is then presented to the buyer.
MLIT explains that the introduction of inspections will benefit both buyers and sellers.
This is because sellers can avoid post-delivery claims and give buyers peace of mind by conducting a property survey prior to the sales transaction.
This, in turn, will help differentiate the company from competing properties.
On the other hand, for the buyer, the system allows him or her to grasp the condition of the used house to be purchased and to make a purchase with satisfaction, which, at first glance, seems to be a system with great merit.
However, under the current system, it is mainly the seller who takes the initiative in building condition surveys.
In addition, it should be noted that only the notification of the system of inspection was obligatory.
In other words, the real estate agent in charge of brokering is obligated to explain that "when brokering a property, we can introduce an architect to conduct a building condition survey" or "we cannot", but the implementation itself is not obligatory.
On the other hand, looking overseas, similar systems are already in place in the U.S., U.K., and other countries where the used home market is booming.
This is a system whereby the buyer requests a building survey by a specialist called an "inspector" or "building surveyor" in the preliminary stages of a home sale or purchase.
In the United States, for example, inspections are conducted in 70-90% of existing home transactions, depending on the state.
The nature of the inspection process differs greatly from the "seller"-oriented Japanese style inspections in that the "buyer" takes the lead in conducting the inspection.
The sellers try to make the condition of the building look as good as possible and sell it as quickly and for as high a price as possible.
In contrast, the buyers want to examine the survey and make appropriate repairs to ensure a safe and comfortable living environment.
Even though the inspections are the same, there is a discrepancy in the objectives and thoughts of both parties.
Therefore, the following points have been raised as risks of concern regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of the seller-initiated inspections set by the government is minimal.
Since it is not a detailed survey, there is a risk of overlooking truly important defects ●For an inspection company, the brokerage firm (seller) that introduces the project to the company in charge can be considered a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that "discovery" inspections will be conducted, such as not reporting findings that are unfavorable to the seller

To begin with, "Ginza" refers to a silver coin mint, and in 1612, the Ginza government office, which had been located in present-day Shizuoka City, was relocated to Edo (present-day Tokyo).
At that time, it was called "Shin-ryogae-cho," but when it moved to Kakigaracho, it became commonly known as "Ginza.
By the way, the Ginza area used to be a "peninsula" jutting out into the sea.
Prior to the Edo period, an inlet entered the area from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called "Edomaejima" extended from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula is the current Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu established the shogunate in Edo, he reclaimed the inlet and developed the Kyobashi area.
Furthermore, Ieyasu laid out the city block and built a moat wall to develop boat transportation.
They then reclaimed the cove by cutting down the soil from the moat and Mt. Kanda.
There is a stone monument in front of the Tiffany Ginza main store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku, Tokyo) that marks the site of the Ginza government office as the "birthplace of Ginza," so those who are interested can look for it.
A "pilgrimage to a sacred place" in Ginza for those in the know
In Ginza, there is an annual "pilgrimage to sacred places" called the Ginza Hatcho Shrine Tour, which is known by those in the know.
Of the more than 10 sacred shrines, the most visible is probably the Kabuki Inari Shrine, located in front of the Kabuki-za Theater.
Many people visit the shrine, which stands at the right end of the Kabuki-za Theater, before and after seeing a play.
On the other hand, Ryuko-Fudoson is located on the rooftop of the Ginza Matsuya Department Store, and Ginza Suisei-Jizoson is on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi's Ginza Terrace.
The Hodo Inari Shrine, Azuma Inari Shrine, and Toyoiwa Inari Shrine are located at the end of an alley and may not be easily seen, but Toyoiwa Inari Shrine is known to have been revered by the famous Kabuki actor Ichimura Hazaemon, and the Success Inari Shrine at the first floor entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building is closed to the public except during the Haccho Shrine Tour.
This shrine tour includes some shrines that worship Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bosatsu, but most of them worship Inari.
The "Inari Shrine," where a fox welcomes visitors in front of the shrine, was built in areas where there were many farmers, as it was believed to be beneficial for "good harvests" of rice.
This in turn led to the spread of the belief in Ginza, Japan's most prosperous shopping district, where it was said to bring prosperity to business in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo (now Tokyo).

The police are hurrying to confirm his identity and are investigating the cause of death.
Meanwhile, a man in his 70s was also found lying in the Sunagawa River in Fukuoka-cho, Okazaki City, and was confirmed dead.
The man's clothes were undisturbed, but his bicycle was lying nearby.

South Korea's POSCO International Acquires Australia's Cenex Energy, Expands Overseas Gas Field Business = South Korean Press (WoW! Korea)
POSCO International announced on April 12 that it has signed an agreement to acquire shares of Australia's Senex Energy and an investment agreement with Hancock Energy for the acquisition of Senex Energy.
The acquisition process is scheduled to be completed in March of next year, with the approval of Cenex Energy's shareholders and local subsidiary still pending.
This acquisition is the largest global merger and acquisition (M&A) case since POSCO International was integrated into the POSCO Group in 2010.
The total purchase price is 770.9 billion won, of which POSCO International and Hankook Energy have decided to invest 50.1% and 49.9%, respectively.
POSCO International explained that it decided on this acquisition because it believes that the demand for natural gas will continue to increase even in the era of energy transition, and that in the hydrogen market, natural gas-based blue hydrogen will bifurcate the market along with green hydrogen.
With this acquisition, POSCO International will also secure 802 billion cubic feet (802 Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, and local onshore gas field operations personnel in Australia.

That knee pain may be "osteoarthritis of the knee" ! ?
Different treatments for different causes (Medical DOC ) - Yahoo! News
Editor: I have been having ongoing knee pain lately.
What diseases are possible?
Dr. Maruyama: Knee joint pain can be caused by a variety of reasons, including injury, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among these, osteoarthritis is the most common among Japanese people.
Editor: Do you mean that the joints become deformed?
Dr. Maruyama: Yes.
Essentially, the surfaces of joints are covered with cartilage, which is responsible for dampening impact and smoothing joint movement.
However, aging, obesity, and strenuous sports can cause cartilage to wear away or become distorted.
This results in joint deformity and inflammation.
Editor: Can osteoarthritis occur in more than just the knee?
Dr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints and bases of the fingers of the hands, the neck, the lower back, the thumbs of the feet, and the hip joints.
The most common case, however, occurs in the knee and is called "osteoarthritis of the knee.
Editor: To begin with, what is the structure of a joint?
Dr. Maruyama: A joint consists of two bones assembled unevenly.
The area where the two face each other is covered with "articular cartilage," and the joint is surrounded by an "articular capsule.
Editor: It is a complex structure.
Dr. Maruyama: Yes, that's right.
The inner layer of the joint capsule contains a tissue called synovium, which makes joint fluid.
This joint fluid acts as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
That is why people say, "Hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for smooth knee motion."
Editor: What are the symptoms of osteoarthritis?
Dr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage is viscous and elastic and plays a role in preventing direct bone-on-bone collisions.
It acts as a cushion, so to speak.
However, when these become worn or distorted, they deform and inflame the joints, causing pain.
Do you wear pajamas to bed?

3 Gambling & Games from the "Kaiji" Series You Can Actually Experience (Real Sound) - Yahoo!
The "Kaiji" series, a gambling manga series that boasts explosive popularity among men.
One of the most exciting aspects of this work is the extreme game of life.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes me shuffle my feet ... ... Challenge to cross a steel frame!
Therefore, we would like to examine the Kaiji games that can actually be played or are practiced in the project videos.
Numa It is a pachinko "swamp" full of traps that appeared in "Gambo Kyoukai Roku Kaiji".
In the original, the high rate of 4,000 yen per ball astonished the Kaiji.
This "swamp" had a "forest of nails," a "movable role," and a "three-tiered cloon," and was considered almost impossible to conquer.
However, the Kaiji used every trick in the book, and in the end, he successfully defeated the building by placing a vinyl water tank on the building and causing the ground to sink and tilt.
The "swamp" featured in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko game, and many people play it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4,000 yen per ball," and the difficulty level is reduced, but you can still feel like a Kaiji.
The rich man held a "star side party" as an entertainment and had the debtors, including Kaiji, perform a "human horse race" steel frame crossing.
Debtors compete to see how fast they can advance on a thin steel frame set up 10 meters above the ground, devising ways to avoid falling off.
Twelve people participated, and the top two winners get the prize money, but there are only four steel frames, inadequate safety measures, and a very high chance of death.
This steel-frame crossing is highly dangerous, but it was developed as a VR game and can be experienced extremely closely at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi, home of the professional baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles.
This Eagle Bridge has a single steel-frame bridge coming out at a height of 20 meters (equivalent to the seventh floor of a building), and a "sky swing" and a "victory bridge" are prepared at the end of the bridge, which you walk to.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Comedian Koala Koarashi became the talk of the town when he released a video on his YouTube page showing him walking across the Eagle Bridge, claiming that he could experience steel frame crossing in Japan.
E-Card" is a card game for two players.
The game is played on the emperor's side and the slave's side, using a total of 10 cards: one emperor's card, eight citizen's cards, and one slave's card.
The game is very well played, with the characteristics that the emperor is strong against the citizens, the citizens are strong against the slaves, and the slaves are strong against the emperor.
In the play, Kaiji plays against Tonegawa under the strict rule that if he loses, his ear will be cut off.
After realizing that his mind was being read by an ear-destroying device attached to his ear like an earphone that detects and transmits changes in pulse and body temperature, Kaiji confounded Tonegawa by cutting off his own ear to the limit and turning his body to abnormal values, and won the battle.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased on Amazon and other retailers.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of him playing e-cards with Tatsuya Fujiwara, who played Kaiji in the movie, which created a lot of buzz.
■Can I try to feel like a Kaiji?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but it is true that reading the manga only makes you feel better.
Why don't you try to feel the world view through the game?
Gently encouraging the first step toward the New Year, a large ema of a tiger at the Prefectural Gokoku-jinja Shrine｜Yamagata Shimbun
A large ema (votive tablet) depicting the Chinese zodiac sign for the coming year, "Tiger," has appeared at the Prefectural Gokoku Shrine (Yamagata City), where preparations for the New Year are underway.
The students of Tohoku University of Art and Design, who designed the design, visited the shrine on November 11, and a dedication ceremony was held in front of the shrine.
Since the year before last, the shrine has commissioned Geijutsu Daigaku students to create original drawings for the ema (votive picture tablet).
The work of Yui Tsuchiya, 22, a third-year student, was selected from among nine paintings by nine students in the Japanese painting course of the art department under the direction of Professor Toshiaki Suenaga.
The large ema is 3.3 meters wide and approximately 1.8 meters high at the center.
Tsuchiya said he painted the image of cherry blossoms gently pushing back the backs of people as they step into the new year.
The image of the tiger standing still and gazing at the cherry blossoms was created with the hope that people will have time to appreciate the beauty of nature even in a rapidly changing world.
Tsuchiya's design is also depicted on ema, which are distributed to the public.
I think it will help all people to overcome difficulties," said Kenichi Chiba, 44, a Gonnegi.

Let's think about "Tamano, where we want to continue to live": Workshop for students of four high schools in the city to make a proposal : Sanyo Shimbun Digital
What kind of town will Tamano be in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano are working together on a workshop to think about "Tamano, where we want to continue to live.
As part of the research and policy recommendation project of the Tamano SDGs Mirai Zukuri Center, an intermediary support organization, the voices of young people will be compiled into a proposal to the mayor and others.
When is it fun? When is it fun?
When asked by the facilitator, students responded verbally, "When I get excited with many people," "When I beat the drums," and so on.
The first meeting was held on November 13 at Hinode Fureai Kaikan.
Eighteen high school students and local residents discussed "interesting towns," "livable towns," and "towns where people feel a sense of purpose in life" using the "World Café" method, in which participants moved from one "island" to another, each with a specific theme.
Each idea is written on a sticky note and put on a piece of imitation paper to organize it.
A town with many young people seems interesting," and "transportation, such as trains and buses, is essential for livability.
We will discuss further to see if there are any commonalities.
I thought Tamano was boring, but cycling along the seaside is appealing," said a senior at Tamano Commerce and Industry High School (18).
A third-year student at Binan High School (18) said, "There are few stores and traffic is inconvenient, but the area is rich in nature." By talking with adults as well, the students seemed to realize not only the challenges of the area but also its charms.
In December, the second meeting was held with only high school students to organize the recommendations.
The presentation will be made next February, inviting the mayor and the superintendent of education.
Rie Higashi, the center's president, says, "We hope that this will nurture the high school students' love of their hometown and provide an opportunity for young people to become proactively involved in community development.

How to find a new way to wrap a stole (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo!
Stoles are indispensable in winter, but do you find that sometimes the fabric gets frayed around your neck?
After curling the hair, it is best to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror, but we sometimes hear people say they don't quite know how to do this.
If only there was a stole that could be wrapped quickly and easily without the fabric becoming frayed... I was wondering if there was a scarf that I could wrap quickly and easily without the fabric becoming frayed.
The COTTORI brand's scarves are approximately one meter in length, making them more compact than most scarves.
When I first saw it, I thought, "How short can it be? I was like, "Can you roll it?"
Upon closer inspection, one can see that it is made up of long, narrow pieces of cloth cut and woven into a single piece, the entire piece being a meshwork.
The ends of the stoles can be threaded through the mesh.
So it can be wrapped and fastened without tying the ends together.
The fleece material is very light and warm.
This year, sleeveless gilets (vests) are popular even for jackets, and many people will wear them in combination with a stole to keep their shoulders cool.
I am sure that having such a stole would come in handy.

The Beatles documentary coming to Disney Plus is super interesting.
It's called Get Buck and it was directed by Peter Jackson.
It's raw, it's life-size Beatles, it's fresh in so many ways. ......
It's right before the breakup, so it's awkward, but not the dramatic awkwardness I had imagined.
Paul, who tries his best to be the leader of the group, but is a pain in the ass, saying "I know I'm annoying, but you know what? I know I'm annoying, but come on!", or "But you know what?", or "But you know what?", or "But you know what?", or "But you know what?", or "But you know what?", or "But you know what? The other day, I was in the middle of a conversation with a friend of mine who was a great friend of mine.
There is a certain atmosphere of "well, we can't work together anymore," even though we don't hate each other to the point of fighting.
And even in that atmosphere, when the performance started, everyone was really full of talent.
We started with a little phrase and said to each other, "What do you think of this? and the process of making it into "that famous song" is amazing!
Especially the moment when the title Get Buck is created is amazing!
It is amazing that the scene where the casual humming like "hum hum hum hum hum hum" gradually became "zucha zucha zucha" and the lyrics were recorded so well.
It's not often that we get to see the process of composition like this, so it's amazing!
And, well, of course, everyone is so fat that just watching the performance scene makes me happy.
This is only the first of three episodes, but so far I got the impression that the biggest cause of the breakup was the environment around the Beatles rather than the Beatles themselves.
The four of them complain about everything, but when they start writing songs, they seem to be having a good time. But when it came to the question of where to play, the producers and publicists started to say, "The Beatles are the best in the world, after all! It was easy to see that the Beatles had already left their own hands.
Well, documentaries are also subject to the director's interpretation, so maybe that's how Peter Jackson felt about it. ......
Also, I heard that Paul is supervising the project, so maybe that's why Paul seems to be the bad guy in many scenes.

Tornadoes in the U.S. Causing Significant Damage: Unseasonably Warm and Strong Cold Weather (WeatherNews)
From the night of Friday the 10th (local time) to Saturday the 11th (local time), tornadoes were frequent, especially in the southern United States.
It is believed that the strong cold air moving southward caused extremely unstable atmospheric conditions and rapidly developed cumulonimbus clouds at a time of record warmth for this time of the year.
Warm air flowed into the southern U.S. from the southwest, bringing record high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, local time on Thursday the 9th and Friday the 10th saw highs near 30°C (86°F).
In the midst of this record-breaking warmth, strong cold air of -30°C or lower moved southward at around 5,500 m above the ground, forming an active front due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly along the front.
A series of tornadoes are believed to have occurred in the vicinity.
The southern United States has always been prone to tornadoes, but early summer and summer are the high season, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
Tornado warnings issued in a single day during the winter reached nearly 150, a record number.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration received more than 400 reports of tornadoes and wind gusts on Friday the 10th (local time) alone.
This shows that there are two major areas of concentration: the southern line from Kentucky to Texas and the northern line that includes Illinois.
In Kentucky, the tornado reached EF3, the third strongest of six on the EF Scale (Modified Fujita Scale), which indicates the strength of a tornado, and is believed to have had instantaneous wind gusts of around 70 m/s.
Depending on future surveys, it may be determined to be EF 4-5.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the Modified Fujita Scale) is used, which is based on the Modified Fujita Scale and adapted to the conditions of buildings in Japan.
JEF3, the equivalent of this U.S. tornado, has a good chance of occurring in Japan, and is at a level that could collapse wooden houses.
I bought a good luck charm and am thinking of putting it in my wallet (not a money charm) because I want to carry it with me at all times, but is it safe to put the amulet as it is?
Should I fold the paper bag and put it in the paper bag that was put in at the shrine?

U.S. Tornado, "Largest in History," Cries for Help Broadcast Live from Beneath Rubble (Nikkan Sports)
On March 11, U.S. President Joe Biden described the damage caused by the tornadoes in the Midwest and South as "one of the largest tornadoes in U.S. history.
CNN television in the U.S. and other media reported.
Biden stressed that "we will do everything we can as a federal government.
The full extent of the damage, including how many lives were lost, is not yet known," he explained.
The death toll was feared to exceed 100.
[Photo] Residents carrying household goods from damaged homes in tornado-devastated Kentucky From the night of October 10 to early morning of November 11, more than 30 tornadoes hit at least six states, including Kentucky.
Although a record 219 miles (350 km) of tornado damage was recorded in 1925, when it damaged Missouri and other states, CNN's weather experts also estimated that this time it was the largest, at about 250 miles (400 km).
In Mayfield, Kentucky, the hardest hit area, a candle factory that was operating around the clock in preparation for the Christmas shopping season was also severely damaged.
110 people were working there at the time, but the building was destroyed and no trace of them remains.
In the darkness, a woman stuck under about 1.5 meters of thick debris felt the weight of rescuers searching over the debris and called for help via a Facebook live broadcast from her smartphone.
The live broadcast released to the public included a woman screaming for help, as well as screams and the singing of "Happy Birthday to You," which another woman apparently sang while crying to drown her fears.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk in Mayfield, hid in the basement of her home with her 5-year-old son when a tornado warning was issued and was safe.
He recalled, "Many people compare it to the sound of a train, but it was more like something erupting, like the earth shaking, a horrible sound."
A Mayfield police officer said, "Search operations will continue until there is no longer a need for them.
I don't know if it will be weeks, months, or years," he said, continuing his hard rescue efforts.
In Illinois, at least six people were confirmed dead when a warehouse belonging to Internet shopping giant Amazon partially collapsed.
Train cars were derailed with such force that they were cut off, and highways were blocked one after another due to overturned vehicles.
According to U.S. web media, a total of about 400,000 homes are without power, including 130,000 in Tennessee.

It's tough to be on welfare...
Fingers crossed we can work something out.
It would be nice to have a "live-in job" like an inn or resort job to secure both an address and a source of income, but in the current social climate of the Corona disaster, there seem to be few options.

The old discourse is that there are different attitudes toward the star system rating system.
The argument is that while other countries use 5 stars as a standard from which points are deducted, Japan uses 3 stars as neutral and adds/drops points.
There is already a difference of two stars at the reference point, and four stars has a completely different meaning between "with deductive elements" and "not a masterpiece but an honorable mention".
If there is such a tendency, I think it is a flaw in the system that does not present the meaning of stars. If that is the case, I think it is a flaw in the system that does not present the meaning of the stars.
So if you try to argue with people who insist on this kind of discourse with two choices of Steam ratings, you're going to lose the conversation.

Is there a submersible pump that can be plugged into a standard hose size and powered by USB?
The power capacity that can be obtained from USB is roughly 2A at 5V, which is only 10W.
A submersible pump consumes at least 500W, depending on the thing, so it is impossible to reach.

Home-built radio volume
I built an am radio with a homemade capacitor and coil, but it was too noisy to hear clearly.
At one point I could hear the radio, but it was a different radio than the frequency I'd tuned it to.
It's possible that the tuning wasn't quite right and I didn't hear it properly, but it wasn't the station I assumed it would be...

＜Fried seasonal fish caught in coastal waters and fried prawns with homemade tartar sauce" at "hakobune"｜Life & Culture｜Saga Shimbun News｜Saga Shimbun LiVE
Bento Box Lunch "Fried Seasonal Fish and Fried Shrimp Caught in Nearby Seas with Homemade Tartar Sauce"
Hakobune is a takeout store specializing in colorful bentos and delis (side dishes) made with an abundance of vegetables.
Takayuki Kazuki (39) and Arimi Kazuki (38) opened the restaurant in August of last year, "so that people can enjoy a restaurant atmosphere at home.
One of the popular bento dishes is "Fried Fish and Fried Shrimp with Homemade Tartar Sauce" (1,000 yen).
Fish are selected at the market from the best of the moment.
Takayuki says, "I use the thinnest possible layer of fresh bread crumbs on the fries so that the texture of the ingredients is apparent.
The bento comes with about four kinds of assorted vegetables and deli items, rice made from Hinohikari rice produced in Saga Prefecture and containing millet, and soup.
Vegetables are homegrown in the buckwheat fields or purchased from direct sales outlets in the prefecture.
Side dishes change depending on the season and other factors, but Takayuki, who is a trained French chef, adds color with items such as rapée and ratatouille.
On the other hand, Arimi wants to create a "familiar and comforting taste" like dashimaki tamago (rolled egg), a blend of Japanese and Western flavors that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.
The bento boxed lunch "hand-kneaded hamburger steak with Japanese mutton" (1,000 yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, the company will also launch a charcuterie set, a processed meat product that goes well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to stop by Haneda Airport and saw something that looked interesting, so I tried it!
Ride comfort Not that bad, but sometimes shaky (not enough to get drunk)
Speed Naturally slow
Safety I think it's safe because it slowed down when there were people around and in some cases it stopped completely, but I thought it was dangerous in some places.
The way people look at me, it hurts, being looked at is fine, but they look at me like "you're in my way", it hurts my heart.
Overall Review Not bad, but there was still room for improvement.
It is a shame that it would be easier to use if there were fewer people or if they were asked to move closer to the edge.
Specifically, I thought it would be a good idea to create a dedicated lane or something so as not to get in the way of other people walking around.
However, I thought it would be a nice ride if it were a little less crowded because it was also relaxing and you could take your time and enjoy the scenery!
It was a ride that is difficult to ride unless you have a very patient heart, and the excitement from the sense of the near future that this kind of automatic driving will become mainstream in the future, and the pain from the surrounding eyes was pleasant.
It was fucking embarrassing.

A Family's Long Road to Environmental Activism Taking Root in China's Frontier (JBpress)
(Yuki Kato: Corporate Consultant, Find Asia, a Hong Kong company) China, with its vast land area, is also important in terms of biodiversity, having the world's largest variety of mammals and the third largest variety of plants.
Some municipalities recognize its value as biodiversity and promote the activities of environmental activists as well as environmental protection conducted by the municipality.
Sisapanna (Xishuangbanna) in Yunnan Province, located in southwest China, is one such region.
Her younger sister, Li Xingyin, is currently active as an actress. Sisapanna borders both Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities including the "傣" who share roots with the Thai of Thailand.
The headwaters of the Mekong River, which flows through many Southeast Asian countries, flow through this area.
Xishuangbanna Tai Autonomous Prefecture The area of Xishuangbanna is only about 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of all species of wild animals and 20% of all species of plants.
This time, we met Minhua Lee, who is engaged in environmental protection activities in Sisapanna, at the site and heard about his activities.
You and your German husband have been involved in environmental protection activities for 20 years.
What was the impetus for this?
Mr. Li Our environmental protection activity "Tianxue" started in 2000.
It all started with my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and came to Sisapanna for a joint UN-China science project.
This was the only tropical rainforest area in China and boasted one of the greatest biodiversity.
At the same time, however, economic development was lagging behind.
This led to large-scale logging of the rainforest in the past, both to establish industry in the region and to produce rubber, which was in short supply in China.
My husband was sent here from Germany to study natural resource restoration and biological resources.
Then he met me, who was a reporter here, and we got married.
- Before that, did you not have any interest in conservation?
Mr. Lee I am from Sisapanna, but I had no interest in the importance of the rainforest or the meaning of biodiversity.
So without that knowledge, I had to promote the project with my husband.
Why do you sometimes see people who are not well-faceted or particularly tall, but have an aura about them?
One popular actor said.
An aura is not something that comes out when you want it to.
It is something that comes naturally the moment you have confidence in yourself. And.
I am sure that person has a firm, inner confidence.

I was wondering, is it fine to compliment someone's clothes or say you like their color?
Not too detailed, is it?
I can see it.
I don't think it is detailed.
I'm a little confused as to what you mean by "fine" as I've never been told to be fine with a compliment.
I wonder if it was a detailed compliment or what.
What would you do if Sakura Yokomine confessed to you?
I would reply, "Sakura-san confessed to me, my heart is in full bloom in spring, please do the same for me," and we would go out together.
And to go out, I would like to increase my knowledge of golf and share what we both like to do.
I want to open a Rakuten Securities account, but if I choose not to open a NISA account now, can I open one later when I want to?
The procedure is completed more quickly if opened at the same time.
Now it takes about a week to complete.
Since there is no separate fee, we recommend opening a NISA account at the same time so that you can use it as soon as you want to.

The mods were causing CTDs in my environment, and it took me about a month and a half to identify them.
The data that was stable until March was experiencing CTDs due to multiple factors while not having much time to play since around GW, and it took a very long time to identify them, as I felt that I had to do a little research only around holidays.
Why didn't you analyze the logs with the .Net Script Framework (you'd know in a few minutes if you did)? Some of the errors in the .dll family and mesh-related errors don't stay in the crash log.
0Timing of major CTDs
* All without leaving any footprints in the logs of papyrus, .Net Script Framework, or logging type .dll plug-ins.
* When some NPCs are killed/accumulated attacks: triggered even by console kill → improved by turning off Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree Mr. SE update resumed version) * Possibility of this being a wet dream?
* Basic improvement when camera work triggers kill move for some NPCs → PC kill move setting OFF via .ini: DAR + Nemesis related setting conflict? However, the number of DAR animations has not reached 10,000, let alone the upper limit.
* (Basic outdoor) While moving in the field + activating some magic (e.g., freezing rune), when NPC hit: all improved after 5 consecutive attempts with all SPID use NPC application settings in Dirt & Blood v 2.0 (upper right of MCM) turned off.
Is this due to a shader setting error in some of the additional armor and body meshes worn by some actors/ NPCs? The SPID usage default.ini of 2.0 has a formatting error, but the result should be the intended result and the prerequisite perk should be applied to NPCs.
At first I focused on checking around wetting the site attacks and OnHit related motion/combat mods (.dll's), but I got results like this.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports, at least at the English, German or French level.
I thought it might be helpful as a reminder in case anyone else has a similar CTD problem in a Japanese environment.
Everyone is on the edge of their mentality,
People don't notice it, even family members, let alone co-workers.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically, "How can that person be working so well when it looks so hard?
But perhaps he is also on the edge of his mentality.
I did not resign in the name of mental health, but I think I was at my limit just before I retired.
Thoughts on the Importance of Psychiatric Home-Visit Nursing Care - After Today's Home-Visit Nursing Care
I have been receiving home nursing care for a long time because I suffer from bipolar disorder, and I have had a long relationship with the nurse (female) at the home nursing station I am using, and I believe we have a very good relationship.
We talk about many things every week.
Of course, they do what is necessary for medication management (such as packaging medication in a single package), but above all, today's home nursing reminded me how important pleasant communication is for people with mental illness.
Today, we had a chat about gender differences between men and women, or rather, we discussed gender theory.
I talk about the sexual desires of men and women, why she divorced, and other such topics in home nursing. I also talk about things like, "Is it okay to talk about such things in home nursing?
Sometimes, but not always, I am dressed as a woman.
However, I have heard from acquaintances that in the case of home-visit nursing stations run by psychiatric hospitals, old lady nurses who can no longer work in the wards come and provide only clerical support, or that when occupational therapists come for home nursing, they give instructions from a higher position, saying "We are in charge of medical care. I have heard from acquaintances that they are told that the auntie's nurses only work with administrative staff.
I use a small home nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, and I think they are really good nurses who are frank with me, as an equal, as I have a mental illness.
By the way, she is beautiful lol.
Some of you may have received or are considering receiving psychiatric home health care.
Home nursing is very beneficial for people with mental illness.
If your doctor approves, by all means take it.
Then, choose a good home health care agency.
In the past, I have had to cancel contracts with some places from here because I just couldn't get along with them.
Sorry for the rambling.
I know it's a false warning, but it came out in English and scared me.
Why does it appear in English?
There are a number of things that could cause this, such as...
I don't know what it means in Japanese.

Korea's Hydrogen Technology Patent Is 1/5th of China's ... Korea Delays Implementation of Hydrogen Economy Roadmap (JoongAng Ilbo Japanese Edition) - Yahoo!
The Korean government has announced a hydrogen economy roadmap for 2019.
The plan called for the diffusion of 65,000 fuel cell vehicles by 2022 (cumulative total) and the operation of 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6,000 won (approximately 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, as of November this year, fuel cell vehicles are only at the 27% level of the target (approximately 17,000 units).
The hydrogen station deployment schedule for the core infrastructure is 38% of the target (about 117 stations), and the price per kilometer of hydrogen is at the 8,400 won level, not much different from the price when the roadmap was first announced.
The government's implementation of the hydrogen economy roadmap is well below target.
The National Federation of Economic Organizations (ZENKEIREN) released the report "Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem Status and Policy Direction" on December 12.
According to the report, the hydrogen industry is in fact almost entirely dependent on the United States, Japan, and other countries for its core components and materials.
Toray (Japan) supplies carbon fiber, Kyocera (Japan) supplies platinum catalysts, and DuPont (U.S.), Gore (U.S.), and 3M (U.S.) supply membrane films, the core materials for fuel cell vehicles.
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six countries leading the global hydrogen market (China, United States, European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has increased at an average annual rate of 14% (since 2014).
Korea ranks 5th in the world in the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (cumulative total for 2014-2020).
However, the Federation of Economic Organizations (ZENKEIREN) reported that, "Six countries in fact account for the majority of the global hydrogen market, meaning that they actually rank lower than the competing countries."
The ranking of patents by country is China, the U.S., the EU, and Japan, in that order.
Since 2017, China has overtaken the U.S. to take first place, and has since widened the gap.
South Korea ranked fourth in the number of patents registered in 2020 with 1,033, ahead of Japan (974), but at the 22% level of China (4,721).
The ZENKEIREN proposed that hydrogen technology should be designated as a "national strategic technology" with a large tax credit for capital investment and R&D expenses.

I know it's tough to get anything other than a daily payment, except maybe an address.
And I have a feeling the daily payment will probably be tough without a contact person (phone number).
In addition, an address is required to sign up for a line.
So don't lose your phone line contract...
And even if we could get by with comic books and daily payments for the time being.
Remember, securing the address is a top priority.
It's important to sleep under the covers, and you simply need an address to get a bank account, debit card, and government services.
I'm pretty sure you could go on welfare without an address, but it would be a rare case.

Were elder sister wives in the Meiji and Showa periods a minority compared to today?
I think there were many sister wives.
The term "big sister wife" has become so common that it has become a household word.
In the old days, it was said that one should look for a wife one year older than oneself, even if she had to wear golden straw sandals. I think there were more wives older than now in the Meiji and Showa periods.

Is it a crime for a store to sell something for more than the list price?
PS5 was sold in stores today for 70,000.

Since it is free competition, for example, if a brand-name item becomes scarcer than the list price, etc.
For example, it's considered legal for a painter to become famous and drive up the price.

Takasu: The town council is working on unique council reforms, such as the creation of a quirky flyer announcing regular council meetings and the introduction of a "correspondence book" in which townspeople rate council members.
The town council elections have been uncontested for three consecutive terms, and the aim is to get the town's residents interested.
To publicize the Sunday Assembly to be held on the 12th, approximately 1,800 copies of the new flyer were distributed through newspaper inserts on the 9th.
Asa kara Ikkyu Giron" "Tetsuko's Room" "Sawaguchi Hitoshi Tanken Series" ... ...
The flyer distributed by the town council to all the houses on August 9 is dotted with phrases that allude to the name of a popular TV program.

U.S. aid arms, ammunition arrive in Ukraine for troop training (CNN.co.uk) - Yahoo!
(CNN) U.S. State Department officials reported that equipment, including small arms and ammunition, had arrived in Ukraine under a security assistance plan approved by President Biden by 12 December.
The military aid is worth a total of $60 million (about 6.8 billion yen), and the last of the equipment, including four radars to locate the firing points of mortars and other weapons, will be shipped to Ukraine at the beginning of the year.
According to Pentagon spokesman Kirby, these aids included lethal weapons such as the Javelin anti-tank missile.
The military assistance is aimed at strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities in response to the Russian military buildup and other military buildups around the border with Ukraine.
The U.S. is also becoming increasingly alarmed by Russian military moves and is consulting with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members to formulate a response in the event that Russia decides to invade Ukraine.
President Biden had approved the weapons aid when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the U.S. White House on September 1 of this year.
U.S. military assistance to Ukraine this year amounted to about $450 million.
Total aid since Russia's forced annexation of the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine has amounted to more than $2.5 billion.
U.S. forces are also engaged in training missions for Ukrainian troops.
Last month, the U.S. sent the U.S. Florida National Guard in support of Ukraine in accordance with a multilateral joint training plan.
U.S. special operations forces in Europe also play a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces, according to a Pentagon statement.
The number of U.S. Special Forces operating inside Ukraine has not been disclosed due to operational sensitivities.
President Biden had an online meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the 7th of this month, and they exchanged some tense exchanges on the situation in Ukraine.
The U.S. is also prepared to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

We interview Akira Amari, former chairman of the LDP tax commission, about the future of the "revision" of inheritance and gift taxes, which will "prohibit" gifts during one's lifetime!
The first feature in the December 18 issue of Weekly Diamond is "Talking with Family During the New Year's Holidays!
The Art of Living Gifts and Rush Inheritance".
Although it was overlooked in the 2022 Tax Reform Proposal, which was expected amid the ongoing debate on the unification of inheritance and gift taxes, there is a strong possibility that gifts made before death, a royal road to inheritance tax prevention, will become "forbidden" in the near future.
How will the rules of inheritance change?
In addition to a direct interview with Akira Amari, former chairman of the LDP Tax Commission and a member of the House of Representatives, we will teach you everything you need to know about the basics of gifting and inheritance and tax-saving techniques to make the most of the gift-giving season before the end of the year.
(Diamond Editorial Department, Hiroaki Miyahara)
The tax system will be examined in earnest with a view to establishing a tax system that is neutral in terms of the timing of asset transfers, with a view to taxing inheritance and gift taxes in a more integrated manner.
One sentence in the 2021 Tax Reform Proposal released by the ruling party last year caused great consternation not only among wealthy individuals but also among the middle class.
This is because it means that the rules of inheritance will be completely changed, and "gifts during one's lifetime," a royal road to inheritance tax measures, will be made "prohibited," resulting in a massive increase in inheritance taxes.
The ironclad rule for saving on the highly progressive estate tax is to "reduce the amount of property subject to taxation.
The most powerful trump card, the living gift, has been widely used not only by wealthy individuals, but also by corporate employees who incur a small inheritance tax due to the presence of their homes in the three major metropolitan areas.
The discussion of the "unification of inheritance tax and gift tax" came amidst such a situation.
Although the proposal was not included in the 2010 Tax Reform Proposal announced on December 10, 2010, which was expected to be introduced as soon as possible, the policy toward integration was reiterated in more detailed terms, such as "The current taxation system for taxable gifts at the time of inheritance and calendar gifts will be reviewed," and "The gift tax exemption is a system that does not require any tax burden for the transfer of assets within the family within the limit amount (omitted), and therefore, the tax burden will be reviewed constantly. The policy toward unification was reiterated in more in-depth language, such as "The tax exemption for gift taxation is a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limit amount, and therefore (omitted) will be under constant review.
In an interview with this editorial, former LDP tax policy research chairman and former LDP secretary general Akira Amari said.
The most important thing is to eliminate the advantage or disadvantage depending on the timing of property transfer and to make the tax burden the same no matter when the transfer takes place.
We are currently simulating the problems that will arise (from the integration).
Even if this is not the case, it seems certain that in the near future the government will take a major step in the direction of invalidating living gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So how exactly do the estate and gift tax rules change?

My Righteous Brother" to air terrestrially on January 10, 2022 Yudai Furukawa: "Please look forward to it! "
My Righteous Brother," an FOD original drama starring Yudai Furukawa, will be broadcast terrestrially on Fuji Television Network starting January 10, 2022 at midnight.
Yamatani Hanazumi plays the heroine. Based on the manga of the same title by Morie Satoshi, which was serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" from 2018, this film is a pure love story about a man and a woman who have carried their pasts with them.
Furukawa plays the main character, Kairi, and Hanazumi Yamatani plays the heroine, Riyo.
College student Riyo meets Kairi, a senior at her part-time job.
Kairi, who suffers from insomnia on a daily basis, is a mysterious young man who, for some reason, is able to sleep soundly when he is on Riyo's shoulders.
Riyo is attracted to Kairi, who bears a striking resemblance to her brother who was separated from her after her parents' divorce, but one day, Riyo suspects Kairi is a murderer.
Yudai Furukawa comments "My Righteous Brother" will be aired on terrestrial television from January 10, 2012!
For those who have not been able to watch it on FOD, I hope you will enjoy it, and for those who have already seen it, I think you will learn more about this work by watching the complex psychological portrayal of Kairi and Riyo and the conflicts and changes they go through after learning about the development.
We hope that fans of the original work will also enjoy it.
Please stay tuned!

NFL] Team Wins with Three Passes in One Game: How the Players Felt (BBM Sports)
Jones threw only three passes = Patriots in the game.
This was the fewest number of passes in the NFL in the past 50 years since the Bills recorded two in Week 3 of 1974 against the New York Jets.
The 1974 Bills had an unheralded genius RB in O.J. Simpson, who had surpassed 2,000 yards in a season the previous season for the first time ever.
The Bills dominated the Jets on runs by Simpson and another RB, Jim Braxton.
The main reason the Patriots ran such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town near the border with Canada, and latitudinally it is no different from Kushiro in Hokkaido.
And on this day, the temperature was almost around 1 degree Celsius and the wind was blowing at 18 mph, with snow blowing before the game.
The Bills did not change their play selections much, as they were only local.
The run was 25 times compared to 30 passes.
Allen was 15/30 passing for 145 yards.
There were no interceptions, and it was by no means a poor performance.
There were scoring opportunities, with four red zone penetrations in 10 offensive series.
Especially after the end of the third quarter, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
But in those three innings, we only scored three points on one FG.
Defense in front of the goal in the final stages of the game.
Trailing by four points, the Bills committed a penalty on 3rd&9, which led to a 3rd&14.
The goal is 18 yards away.
On 3rd&14, QB Allen was surrounded by a rush by the Patriots defense and drifted right out of the pocket.
He then threw a pass aimed at TE Dawson Knox in the end zone, but missed.
On this play, ace WR Stefon Diggs, who was on the outside right, ran sharo-across to free himself in front of the end zone, but it didn't seem to catch Allen's eye.
On 4th&18, Allen tried to get WR Gabriel Davis running from outside left into the end zone, but the pass was beaten in front of him by Patriots DB Myles Bryant and failed.
Bryant was man-to-man covering Bills WR Cole Beasley, but midway through the game, he saw Allen move, released Beasley, and reacted to the pass.
After missing two receivers, Allen threw passes, both times aiming for the end zone.
The 4th down pass may have been decisive, but on 3rd down, there was no need to go for a TD.
You only need two plays to get a first down.
Since it was still before 2 Minutes, Allen's ability to have his own run would have come alive if he had gone 4th & short.
For manageable, shiny hair.

Three items that tend to sit in the kitchen for long periods of time that it's time to toss and replace (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo!
sponge
No matter how often you change it, the sponge is probably not being replaced as often as recommended.
A 2017 study shows that kitchen sponges can grow a lot of bacteria even if they are sterilized daily in the microwave (but it is still recommended to sterilize them in the microwave ) .
The German researchers who conducted this study recommend changing the sponges once a week to keep them clean.
chopping board
The United States Department of Agriculture notes that cutting boards should be replaced when they begin to wear out and develop scratches and grooves.
This is because once scars and grooves develop, they become difficult to keep clean and bacteria can multiply.
If it is still safe, remember to disinfect frequently with a solution of a tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in a gallon of water.
Dip the surface of the cutting board in the liquid and let sit for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and allow to dry naturally or pat dry with a clean paper towel.
Chipped or broken dishes
It may be heartbreaking to get rid of a favorite mug, but a chipped surface becomes a new breeding ground for bacteria and germs.
Besides, it can cause chipped lips and spilled drinks.
Yes, it's a chance to buy a new favorite mag!

FlashBIOS won't finish, help!
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X and replaced it with a B550 and Tomahawk I had bought in September.
Once I got to the BIOS setup screen, but when I saved the settings and rebooted, I got a black screen with a white cursor-like dot that didn't blink and kept on receiving.
I thought the BIOS was corrupted and tried to rewrite it using FlashBIOS, but it never finished.
MSI's blog says it takes about 5 minutes, but not even an hour.
The possible causes are that the USB flash drive I tried is too old, or it's one of those that converts to an SD card.
Either you've been sleeping too much or your tomahawk is out of order.
Is there any other cause that sounds like it?

For some reason, I am embarrassed to own brand-name products.
I can carry it as long as it is inconspicuous, but I can't carry something that is heavily monogrammed and says "LV" on it, like a Vuitton or something like that.
Why is this?
I think it's good that it fits your length.
By the way, Japan would be a good choice.
In Japan,. is.
It doesn't matter if it's Gaijin style or not.
You should say early on, "Why am I the only one calling/talking to you?" I'd like to know why you call me that.
And if they start saying, "Well, you're a gaijin, so what does it matter? You should simply tell them that you are uncomfortable.
I probably wouldn't dream of being offended by the so-so odds.
I lived abroad for a while, and there were many Japanese who came here because they didn't like the Confucian traditions, including myself, and they were either unhinged or misunderstood that they could say anything to the locals.
If you look Western, I think you're doing so with a kind of naivete or good-naturedness, purely without malice.
I call my friends in the West by their first names, but when I speak to them in Japanese, I sometimes have a hard time deciding which one to call them.
Well, if it's a friend, it's still good.
I'm sure the original is just purely normal, but if you overlook it, you might not be able to stop the exceptional treatment because you are a gaijin, so you should tell them now while you can.
It's like, "It's Japan, so can you please talk to us according to Japanese rules?
Edit: Not that it matters, but my white friends who are naturalized always raise their glasses higher than other younger people when toasting at a drinking party.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but I think it's a good habit because when I do it that way, I'm not looked down upon by younger and older people in a strange way, or treated like a Japanese person.
Japanese people, regardless of their personalities, have a shitload of people (including me) who look at details like that.

Was this really a long-range sniper?
Not a check?
It is a so-called tangent sight, which compensates for the angle of attack when aiming at an enemy at long range.
You can't be a precision sniper, but if you are accurate with your sights (if you test-fire and correct your sights), you will be able to hit the target there.
Thanks for the 50 subscribers!
I opened reddit today and found that this sable I just made has surpassed 50 subscribers.
I am so happy.
Thanks to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, as of yesterday, we had 25 subscribers and I thought it might take a little longer to reach 50, but for some reason, 25 people subscribed today alone, so I am extremely grateful.
If you've subscribed to this sublet today, I'd appreciate it if you could tell me in the comments section where you learned about this sublet! (I have no idea, so I'm really curious)
I would appreciate it if you guys could also start a thread since I am the only one who is currently doing it.
Even if you don't make a thread, we would be encouraged by your comments, etc.
Maybe people use reddit but not many use twitter.
If you are using twitter, please also slate it!
Last but not least, thank you so much! The previous sablet I made didn't attract as many people as I wanted and I soon gave up on it, but thanks to all of you, I think I will be able to keep going this time without any setbacks.
We will do our best to make Sable easy to use by maintaining the wiki and rules, etc. Thank you for your continued support.

I have only a slight command of English, so I will judge only on the translated text.
I think the translated text is at a level where the text feels a little uncomfortable, but I can understand what you are trying to convey and it doesn't interfere with playing the game (I just feel this way, I think you should ask other people).
It is common to see this level of translation in games produced overseas, and for a small company, I feel that it is well translated.
I think it is not possible for a non-native Japanese speaker to reach an understanding of the detailed nuances of the Japanese language even after long periods of study.
I do not know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level that Japanese people do not feel uncomfortable with, then it would be better to look for someone else.

Consideration "Oni no Kai" training is the battle.
The "Equivalent Exchange of Efforts" is a Hymn to Humanity <Celebrating the Start of the "Yuukaku-hen" Anime Series> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo!
Among recent shonen manga, "Blade of the Oni no Kai" is particularly unique in that there is "an inordinate amount of training.
It is a common theory that the training version, in which there are no battles and the students train day in and day out, is not popular among readers.
This can be inferred from the fact that in the same Jump manga "One Piece," when the Straw Hat gang was separated, they went through two years of training, but the rest of the story was skipped over in a hearty manner, with only a few minor details drawn.
Well, the eccentricity of the lands one travels through is one of the charms of Wampi, and "staying in the same place and practicing" may not be so compatible with it.
Now, the training of Sumijiro, the hero of "Blade of Oni no Kenshin", when he got down on his knees to Tomioka Yoshiyuu, who saved his life, and begged for the life of Nezuko, who tried to take his life, "Don't let others take the right of life and death from you ! ! When he got down on his knees and begged for Priestess' life, who had tried to take his life, he was told by Yoshiyusa, "Don't let anyone else take your life!
The weak have no rights and no options, they are twisted by the strong at every turn. ... ... ...
Having said that, he was kind enough to introduce Sakonji Rinkutaki, a "nurturer" who trains those who wish to join the Onikagitai (he is also a poor communicator who does not explain his intentions).
When Sumijiro's first contact with Rinkutaki was when he was asked what he would do if his sister ate a man, Sumijiro was at a loss for an answer and gave him a hard slap, telling him that he was slow to judge.
It is a seemingly inexcusable exchange that has become the talk of the town among fans.
However, walking around with a sister who has become a demon is fraught with the possibility that there may come a moment when such a decision has to be made.
It can be said to be an initiation into training from the mindset.
However, Rinkutaki takes Sumijiro, a novice who has yet to train, to Mount Sagiri and tells him to make it down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The mountains are so thin air and full of traps such as pitfalls and pitchforks that I would die before I could begin my training.
Even so, he is barely able to "compensate for his protagonist" by using his keen sense of smell to catch the faint scent of a trap set by human hands and somehow avoid it.
Still, "That doesn't mean I'm suddenly so physically strong that I can get around it all, though! ! is the essence of what makes Onimasu Onimasu.
Ordinary people don't suddenly become strong without any proof, and they only awaken when they are able to use "the power and skills they have honed up to that point" at their true potential.
The "equivalent exchange of efforts," which rewards those who make efforts as much as they make them and rewards nothing for efforts that have not been made, is an anthem for human beings, different from demons that can have unfounded supernatural powers, and is an unmovable rule that is consistent in this work.
Is this old?

The house is not an apartment.
I do that too.
If you want to use a large room, it is better to sleep on a futon than on a bed.
I think there are many such people.
Is it too greedy?
Are people who work part time and want to work full time and work across the board with other stores clingy?
No, I don't particularly think so.
In such a case, it does not fall under my definition of "gauche".
I think of it as being "greedy" to try to get more profit with less effort.

Following the merger of the CE and IM divisions as a set division, Samsung Electronics announced on December 12 that it has decided on the name DX (Device eXperience) and will reflect this in its year-end reorganization.
It can be read as an attempt to enhance the user experience through a variety of services ranging from mobile to consumer electronics.
Samsung Electronics revealed that the DX division, which was newly established by integrating the CE and IM divisions, consists of business units such as VD (Visual Display), consumer electronics, medical devices, MX (Mobile eXperience), and networks.
A Samsung Electronics official explained, "The name change reflects our mid- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthening of global leadership.
He also added that the company emphasized its intention to enable consumers to easily enjoy an optimized experience through products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and telecommunication equipment, as well as services and solutions that reflect customer needs.
With the launch of the integrated leadership structure, the name also reflects the strategy of creating synergies across organizational boundaries and building a foundation of differentiated products and services on a company-wide scale.
Samsung Electronics, through its "Multi-Device Experience (MDE) Council," is already envisioning a strategy to enable users to freely use content and services through the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based interactions among devices, such as home appliances and smartphones. The company is currently developing a strategy to enable users to freely use contents and services through the interlocking of Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based devices such as home appliances and smartphones.
Does 1500 BCE mean B.C.?
How would you put it in Japanese?
1500 BC.
BC means "Before Christ," but in recent years, the term "BCE" has been used more and more, based on the idea that consideration should be given to non-Christians. However, in recent years, the term "BCE" has been used more and more, based on the idea that "BC" means "before Christ" and "BCE" means "before Christ.
BCE stands for Before Common Era.

> They lie, jaws primed, with only their armoured heads visible from the sand... Anything that stumbles into their pit is speared and dragged below.

This is a bit unnatural here.
The hammi larvae lie in wait in the sand, ready to catch their prey at any moment, with only their disk-shaped heads peeking out of the sand.
I think it should be.
I'm curious.
* Did you refer to other documentaries?
* Are you looking at it from an ant's point of view?
Is it?
If you translate "armoured heads" as "disk-shaped heads", I think the "in the ant scale, they are giant beasts with helmets" part would be lost...
Aichi 24-vehicle collision: Trailer driver has no pre-existing medical condition, but may have been careless (TV Asahi (ANN))
In an accident involving a collision of 24 vehicles in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent to the police station had no pre-existing medical conditions and was believed to have caused the accident due to some kind of carelessness.
On the morning of January 10, 24 trucks and passenger cars collided on National Route 41 in Komaki City, injuring 12 people slightly.
Police arrested Katsuya Nomura, 54, the driver of the trailer, on suspicion of first causing a rear-end collision that injured a 71-year-old man, and sent him to the police station on the morning of January 12.
Nomura's trailer continued to move forward without braking after the accident, and firefighters observed Nomura temporarily losing consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, the suspect did not have any pre-existing medical conditions, and it is believed that some kind of carelessness was the cause of his death.
The police have raided the relevant offices and are investigating the details of the situation at the time.

Kinnikuman Review by Oginuma X [Comics Vol. 4] (Shukupre NEWS)
The 20th Chohin Olympics, which began in volume 3, is completed in this volume 4!
In contrast to the previous volume, which depicted the opening and semifinal matches all at once, this volume is full of new tricks because it focuses on only one match!
●"Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Reviewed by Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 of 5 stars) ●Chonin wrestling has already started before the match!
In a word, this fourth volume is a volume that carefully and carefully describes the final match between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but the first thing to keep in mind is that it is by no means a volume that only describes the match in the ring.
Starting with the signing ceremony, the two teams had a check-and-control battle, a training session, and other scenes that were a complete change from the previous games, but it was never dull or boring.
This sense of tension that gradually builds as the battle of the century finally begins is sure to heighten the reader's tension, and even this period of time is a truly calculated performance that is hard to fail to marvel at.
And one more mountain to climb before the all-important final, not to be missed, is the third-place match between Terryman and Ramenman.
Aside from the gorgeousness of the matchup card, what I like about the match is that before the match, backstage, Ramenman says to a poster of Kinnikuman, "It's my turn to take a shot at you! I'm going to get you! I'm going to get you."
and tries to slap a chop on it.
However, Terryman, who happened to be passing by, catches and prevents the hand-to-hand combat, and the scene ends with a silent glare and a parting of the ways that is just that.
What's great about this is that both have already lost and will no longer have the opportunity to fight Kinnikuman within this tournament.
But there is this agonizing dispute over Kinnikuman.
When I am shown something like this, I can't help but think of the successes of the distant future!
This is one act that still makes me keenly aware, as a cartoonist myself, that this is what it means to be a character!
The fight between the two ends without much time, but the famous scene is Ramenman's tearful plea after the match.
To Kinnikuman, "Don't just rely on the luck of the gods ! Don't just rely on God's luck! !"
This is the line that says.
I think this is a grandiose meta statement about the work itself. I think readers have always felt that Kinnikuman was the main character, that he would not lose, and that he had somehow won in a way that was not based on his ability.
But by having Ramenman make this statement, Yudetamago-sensei himself has nailed the nail in the coffin, telling Ramenman that he cannot use that move even before he does.
With this one word, the reader is left wondering, "Oh, so Kinnikuman is going to defeat Robin by sheer force?
How? How?"
From an artist's point of view, this line is as if Yudetamago-sensei, the creator of the work, has imposed a binding on himself.
I thought, "This is a great thing they have done.
Definitely one of the major points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend at Aobayama, Takahama Town (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting Co., Ltd.) - Yahoo!
The first winter illumination has begun at Aobayama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama Town, and the park is now enveloped in gentle light.
(December 12) The winter illumination, which began on November 26, features a 20-meter-high camphor tree and a total of 50,000 LED bulbs scattered along the walking path and lawn.
A visitor from Shiga Prefecture said, "It's been a long time since I've been to Fukui, and I was surprised to find such a place.
It was so beautiful and a relief," he said.
The illumination was planned for the first time to provide a healing experience while avoiding density, and will be lit from 5:00 to 8:30 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays through December 25.
On the 25th, the last day of the festival, a Christmas event will be held, featuring a pot of button stew and a movie screening.

(In fact, it is easier to apply and understand if you learn from Linux or something similar than if you start with something as abstract as docker.
It's tough to take that out of the equation and suddenly understand everything.

Orchishima Agricultural Promotion Association Broadcasts Live from Yonezawa, Promoting Agricultural and Livestock Products
On November 11, the Okitama Agricultural Promotion Council, consisting of municipalities and JA (Japan Agricultural Cooperatives) in the Okitama region, held a PR campaign for agricultural and livestock products using "live commerce," in which products are sold while being video-streamed on the Internet.
The Yamagata Ai no Busyoutai and others made a remote appearance on "National Cooperation MINATO Market TV," which was first organized by Tokyo's Minato Ward, and delivered the charm of the region along with local specialty products.
The "Okitama x Minato Kaikou Project," a collaborative effort between the Okitama region and Minato Ward, led to the decision to open a store, which was broadcast live from the Satoyama Vision House in Minamihara Shinmachi, Yonezawa City.
Mika Kuroda, who is active as a "Satoyama Sommelier," introduced the charms of the area surrounded by nature wearing a stole of the Yonezawa textile brand "nitorito.
He also delivered a sweet potato stew party with the Samurai of Love.
In a studio in Tokyo, Emiko Kawamura of the comedy duo Tanpopo and other YouTubers with over 300,000 registered users tasted Okitama's local sake, wine, Yonezawa beef, Tsuyahime, and more.
When he told viewers how delicious the food was, they commented in praise, "I can smell it even though it's distributed," and "It's great with lots of delicious (tasty) things to drink.

I had a bad day this morning...
PC for NAS no longer turns on: 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
~What Happened~.
1.) Open the windows in the morning for ventilation.
The PC is energized at this time.
2.) When I returned to my room a little later, I noticed a pink-rotor-like sound coming from my PC and shut it down for the moment.
At this point, we assumed that the fans were only slowing down due to the drop in room temperature (6°C).
So I decided to try again after warming up the room.
3.) Not activated.
When the power button is pressed, the power light comes on for a moment and the fan runs, but it stops immediately.
After that, they didn't say a word.
I unplugged the power and tried again, but it still comes on for a moment.
4.) Tried connecting only the motherboard and ATX 20-pin and 4-pin and removing all other parts, but no boot.
5.) I suspect that the PSU is the cause of the problem because I have heard a buzzing noise in the past as if the fan of the PSU was hitting something.
I'll find an extra ATX power supply later and give it a try.
Probably.
If not...what should I do?
I'll change the case and mother together or...

I can't get a girlfriend. Are they discriminating against me because of my face?

What did you do with your school sportswear after graduation?
I wear it as everyday wear ^_^.

You should not live together.
There is a good chance that they will break up.
It is better to make a proper matchmaker, have a binding ceremony, go to bridal this and that, and have a wedding ceremony and reception.
Cohabitation is of no benefit.
I don't think you should...
Today I went to a game center and played an arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Ganbarising.

I think it is an ant.
