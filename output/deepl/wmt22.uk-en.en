Good afternoon, I'm sorry I didn't have internet and couldn't send it faster. Thank you
Could you please tell me the exact address where to go tomorrow for cleaning, what is the code for the keys, and what time tomorrow the guests check out and the new guests check in?
Unfortunately, I have to decline your offer, because I have already found a job during this time.
I'm sorry, but I can't refuse there.
Sometimes it seems to me that my thoughts in Czech are different from what I wrote in Ukrainian because of the translator.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Good afternoon, I agree to take the course.
However, could you please tell me if there is an earlier time?
Because I don't live in Prague, there may be difficulties with transportation.
If there are no other options, then I still agree.
Thank you in advance.
In Kherson, people rallied again, before the Russians could disperse them
As the participants of the event told the agency, Kherson residents managed to hold a rally before the Russian military arrived to disperse them with equipment.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now the Russian military equipment has arrived there," said one of the participants.
Previously, citizens traditionally gathered to protest on Svobody Square, near the RSA and regional council buildings.
This square, as well as the building, is currently controlled by armed Russian troops, who use weapons against protesters and abduct people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupants used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported, residents of Donetsk region regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military is using force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
Russian invaders also abduct residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Kherson the special title of Hero City.
On February 24, Russian President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive attacks on residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and ballistic missiles.

Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, if it stops fighting, we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the battles for eastern Ukraine, and Mariupol in particular, will determine the course of the war - and if the Ukrainian Armed Forces are defeated there, the Russians may abandon the negotiations and reoccupy the de-occupied territories.
Direct speech: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It's fighting - we are fighting, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will be in a weaker position.
They (the city's defenders - ed.) are the people who drew back a large number of enemy.
The stronger our position in Mariupol is, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (JFO) area, and if they are stronger, the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these areas, we may not be able to meet.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that could lead to a return even to the cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for it, too.
Then our position in the negotiations will be weaker and perhaps not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we state.
We believe in our result, in our victory...".
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we must not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have it."
Direct speech: "People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, on the terms of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something, and I don't think they will be satisfied with any peace on any terms.
But if we are not talking emotionally, the war must end in peace, or it will end with millions of victims.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to an end before the war is over.
Yes, we must fight, but for the sake of life.
You cannot fight for dust when there is nothing left, no people."

Due to the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts have become necessary to describe its new qualitative state.

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has released a list of Russian servicemen who participated in war crimes in Bucha, Kyiv region.
According to Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported this on Facebook.
"Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine has obtained a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade directly involved in committing war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha," the statement reads.
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine notes that all war criminals will be brought to justice for crimes against the civilian population of Ukraine and will be held accountable.
You can view the list here.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel, and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from Russian invaders.
In the liberated towns and villages, mass killings of civilians by the Russian military were recorded.
On April 1, Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk reported that 280 people were buried in mass graves.
Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of murdered civilians were taken from the territory of Kyiv region liberated from Russian invaders.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the start of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The Russian invaders' troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive attacks on residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, ballistic missiles, and air bombs.

We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
It was great, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the neighborhood doesn't matter, I would be very grateful.
Most of my friends are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal abuse of civilians north of Kyiv.
The photos of tortured and shot people embarrassed the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people are asking each other how this could happen in the 21st century! How?!
But nothing surprised me at all. It was exactly what I had been sadly waiting for...
I took my children and elderly parents out of Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then he married his female colleagues with children, and only then returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have been consistently helping the Armed Forces of Ukraine and never for a moment doubted that in the event of the occupation of the Kyiv suburbs, my family would not be spared.
Because I was and still am absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
It simply cannot exist without terror, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in a prison in Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU allowed me to take a copy of my great-grandfather's execution file: the entire file is over a hundred pages long, but the sentence of death is very simple and therefore even more terrifying.
The accused was illiterate and denied his guilt.
He was an ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was a free man, a poor "one-yard" gentry, who had never been serfs.
The fact that they lived on farms and had a few cows was enough to condemn the plowman and the feeder of young children to death.
Relatives did not even know about the burial place.
My grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed, except for two who agreed to give false testimony.
The criminal file contains the name of the snitch Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and would not be surprised if it was his relative who was a KGB informant.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, as you know...
The firing squad that condemned the peasants to death were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing his great-grandfather's case, he became interested in various information resources.
There are excellent (no sarcasm) information resources in Russia, such as the "Bessmertny Barrack," which provide a good reminder of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVDists have found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repression and publicly wrote the names of the killers were first discredited and then destroyed by the system.
Allegedly, files with child pornography were found on his computer, he was imprisoned for it, and died quickly there.
The KGB still kills those who try to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you surprised by their actions now?
The most vile traits of human nature are concentrated there.
Slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th centuries were superimposed on the millennial Horde tradition.
And then they performed a brutal genetic experiment on what they got, cutting out the intelligentsia during several waves of the Red Terror.
Watch the 1992 semi-French movie Chekist, and you'll see how it was.
Have you seen my swimsuit photos?
Can I ask my wife what I can buy for a cough?
I'm sorry, I don't have anyone to ask
I also wanted to ask you if you know where the children went, because Galya can't find them.
Lyubosh, Ihor asks if it's convenient for you to go tomorrow (he's off and can go, because the car hasn't been checked at the station yet).
We are very sorry to bother you so much.
You help us a lot, thank you!

Please help with housing, for money please.
But where it's safe and not smoky.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is so strong, it's not as if they are smoking here.
I'm asking you very, very much, one of them can barely stand on his feet, he's shouting something, he doesn't like something. It's very scary.

Yesterday everything went very well.
We talked about children with special needs and the system of their education in Ukraine.
When Ms. Shakhova introduced me as an employee of Fpoint, the first question she asked was how they found the dog, how they found the pug.
Everyone follows the Facebook page.
They asked me to give you their greetings and say that they are very interested in reading the news.
We also talked about Roma people and their privileges in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if a child comes and the parents don't understand Czech at all, I can help them by phone after work.

The main thing is that love should be real and mutual.
I don't know about Europe, but in our country people get married for different reasons, mostly for selfish, mercantile purposes.
And I have a problem with this, if I don't love a person, nothing will work.
Yes, we took it home and took it to my aunt right away.
She was very grateful, she was crying.
I told her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
She said if it was possible, maybe there would be some old blankets and pillows.
But it is not necessary. Only if you want to. I'm very grateful to you too.
Of course, I felt sorry for him.
My best friend was killed before him.
I had a lot of questions to God about why there were situations in my life that just made me lose faith in everything.
Are the small grocery stores open? I need to buy bread and other groceries.
It's just that I decided to go and you made the arrangements
This is true, but we are not yet oriented in the area and do not know where everything is. Today we were looking for a supermarket for an hour and returned on foot. Two blankets are not suitable, so we need two large ones
Even now, I was thinking about you, and you wrote to me.
Is your dad the only one who can speak Russian, or is there someone else in the family?
Children can come to Valia's and play in the hall
Okay, let's take a chance then :)
I am also glad to have met you
I talked to Volodymyr about housing and asked him whether I should wait for them to find me a place to live or look for it myself. The ladies who live with us told me that we should go to the Museum metro station, where there is an institution that helps to find housing.

I just got home and am having breakfast :)
Don't explain anything, please pretend I'm not here
it is impossible to answer without sending a resume
I can't tell my mom that :)

God willing, Yura will fall asleep üôè Maybe I'll go straight to bed and get some sleep.
I will write to you in any case.

According to Yevropeiska Pravda, Welt reports this with reference to sources in Ukrainian government circles.
According to the publication, the proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
Howitzers are also offered in a variant on the Boxer APC for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in combat have to get relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire from a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
According to Ukrainian government sources, citing KMW's proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will be carried out on a circular basis.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers as soon as possible, and the gaps will be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers may be delivered 30 months after the contract is signed, i.e. before the second half of 2024.
Full delivery will not be completed until 2027.
Is this us in the morning or in the afternoon together?
We'll find a way to get the rest of the information and get it out. I will write you back. Thank you.

Hi. Yes, I'll be waiting for you at 6 o'clock.
How long did you study for this specialty

I'm sorry, I must have confused something.
I didn't understand Czech that well at the time.
I must have invented something for myself.

Can you tell me how to get to the city center?
I will share my thoughts with you.
For me, marriage is a sacrament of two people who do not discuss each other with their family or friends.
A man and a woman solve issues in their family by themselves, especially without the involvement of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we are there for you.
Why not try it this way for now
I rented a car for 9 people, we will come with Mariana and your family.
How much time do you have? What time do you need to leave?

We liked everything very much.
We feel like we are in our own family.
The children spent the whole evening telling their dad and all their grandparents how good it was with you.
Greetings from the girls! Best wishes for the holidays from us!
And now where did we look?
I hope that my son will come out of this meat grinder alive.
We'll go today, maybe we'll find something useful.
How do I contact them to get them to open the door?
Are there any improvements in overcoming the coronavirus?
I am very grateful for helping people. If you can, please help us too. Find cheap housing.
We are now in Slapa, our friends have sheltered us for an hour.
My family: husband, daughter 6 years old, son 11 years old.
The man has already found a job as a driver.
I am a massage therapist and rehabilitation specialist looking for a job.
In order for the children to attend school and for me to work, we need housing close to civilization.
I just had to give back today!
Nothing. We'll wait until tomorrow. I didn't know that even the big stores would be closed.
I make cabbage rolls like this: in a saucepan, I dilute tomato paste with 0.5 liters of water and 3-4 tablespoons of tomato paste - bring to a boil.
I put the cabbage rolls in a saucepan and pour this sauce over them.
Carcass in the oven for about 1.5 hours.
How much money do I have on this number?
I have to bring it all back

The branch in room 29 is designed specifically for submitting and processing applications for assistance, so there is an interpreter on site.
Lydia has already been enrolled in school, but because of her illness we will go on Tuesday, I informed the teacher today
I'm sitting here with my headphones on, listening to music and thinking about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
To make you happy üò¢.
I don't know, darling, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I treat it as if we are together. That we're a couple.
I would say that there will be a lot of work after the war.
So I'm not afraid that I won't find her there.
I can do a lot of things.
So I'm not afraid that I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know what will happen with housing....
I need to undergo an examination for a food license. Can I do it with you?
Please tell me how to prepare an apartment for 5 guests tomorrow.
I assume the fifth place is in the room with the TV?
Lay out and make a sofa?
Can we stay with you while Ms. Margarita finds us a place to live?
don't worry about it
It's not new, we've already used it, but it's working but not needed...
Write the address in Czech, we'll look at the map to see where it is from us
I don't know how much space there is, so I can't plan anything with furniture, I want to finally look at the apartment this week and then understand what kind of furniture I need
Sorry for taking so long to respond, it was a busy day, it's hard to adapt
Is this enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, to be able to hug you.
To kiss you in the morning, to tell you how beautiful you look.
There is already a crib and a bath for the baby, and I found things for the first time
Don't forget that you promised to help me as soon as you have the opportunity, but not to give the last ü§´üòüüòâüôÉ
I want to make a haircut called a cap
Oleg is sick - he has a runny nose and cough. You better not bring Jan with you, so he doesn't get infected
Only I'll be a little later, around 8:00. Is that okay?
I don't want any misunderstandings with you
Because I'm worried about everything going well!
Because we didn't even talk about it with these excursions!
I understand how important this is to you!
And I'm not talking about myself (for me, it's just a pinnacle that is incomprehensible)!
how do you feel today üòÖ after the celebration?
Hi, sorry, I just woke up, I didn't sleep well
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was upset that yesterday Kola and I had a bad start to the test.
I will ask either Hryhorii Denysenko or maybe Jonaszek to help me with math concepts at least a little bit.
Maybe I can be of some use to them?
If I have the opportunity, I want to brush up on my math terms over the weekend.
Geometry is generally difficult, but we have to work with Kola to make sure there are no mistakes.
Thank you for the test tasks
We hope so too.
Otherwise, she is very happy with any gift
I would like to connect the Internet to my Czech number
Yesterday at the 402 bus stop, I met a Ukrainian woman named Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is alone... her eyes are full of tears and grief
I could not stay away.
Now we have agreed that we will be friends.
And last night I thanked God for this girl, because she is the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.
The branch in room #29 is designed specifically for submitting and processing applications for assistance
It turned out that I ordered a spare card
No need, I'm a simple man
So that she doesn't get scared that no one came
I did not go. Yes, I baked it myself. I can do that! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So are you leaving the city for a long time?
Six months ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated the 80th anniversary of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers at Babyn Yar.
I had the honor of speaking after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of "a common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and live in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
This is the foundation we must protect - it is also part of our responsibility related to our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "then for us Germans there can be only one answer: never again!
The struggle must continue."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of civilians, starved the residents of the cities it has blockaded and let them die of disease.
Russian troops are carrying out mass executions of Ukrainians, even visually reminiscent of the executions in Babyn Yar.
For more than a month, Germans have been seeing this on the news in real time.
For example, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, and arms, which was unimaginable not so long ago.
Germany delays the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never Again!" does not only mean opposing the swastika.
This means fighting by all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine without risks and sacrifices.
One song for you at night
We agree, make an appointment for the tour and let us know when you'll be there
Everyone was sick, only Lydia was not sick, they had an omicron, a new type of covid
Then I'll do it tomorrow
I use this card instead of a card
Call for late documents.
The ticket cost me 2000 hryvnia from the conductor
Serhiy Sydorenko: Our NATO membership is no longer a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea, and the outbreak of the war in Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, while supporters, on the contrary, grew.
After the outbreak of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - over 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO is providing in the war, there is a lot of criticism of the Alliance and its member states for not delivering weapons on time, refusing to close the skies, and not wanting to "annoy" Russia.
In addition, there is a high risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its aspirations for membership in the Alliance because of Russia's position if it can stop the war and Ukraine receives reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In a new episode of the Damn Questions podcast, we talk with the editor of Yevropeiska Pravda about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for and what it is criticized for in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is closer than ever in history, and why the security guarantees being discussed in the negotiations with Russia could become a second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think, what's here
In my volt partner, it is indicated that my application is under consideration.
I submitted it through this mobile application
We don't have a visa, we need to go to the congress center and find out how to do it, because it was issued in Poland, where they didn't give us a visa, but a pessimistic visa.
We will definitely write to you!
Denis left today in a good mood.
I arranged to meet a boy from Ukraine, whom I met yesterday, near the school to show him around.
So I hope he is doing well.
Because I don't like it that way, I don't last long
Ukraine reports that the Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine
I go and leave the children alone, wait there for 3-4 hours, and then go home because I can't leave them any longer.
And take it with you at 6-7 a.m.
Yes, I had a sick heart.
I had sincere feelings for this man, but he did not act very decently, and I left him.
After a while, he came back again and apologized to me.
I turned him down.
Then some time later, he called to say that he had undergone heart surgery.
I asked him to just talk to me, and I felt sorry for him.
I supported him psychologically for almost six months.
During this time, we communicated a lot.
At the same time, I started having problems at work.
His support also helped me at the time.
This is mutual assistance.
And I thought, maybe we really need to look at it differently.
He asked me to marry him, and two days later he died.
Therefore, God himself decided our fates.
What does ready for marriage mean to you?
And he speaks only Czech
I wanted to tell you that I managed to find a place to live, and I'm very happy about it ‚ò∫ now I have a place to live and a place to be with my baby.

Okay, let's talk about something else, because I'm not sleeping anyway, I'm still falling asleep and dreaming about the bombing...
God is never late, everything has its time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I am well aware of the price of unskilled labor and understand that I will not be able to have the same job I had at home in Kyiv, and I will not be able to earn the money I used to earn at home here now.
But I can't just sit and do nothing, because then all sorts of bad thoughts come to mind, so I need to keep myself busy with some kind of physical activity.
At the airport, documents are processed from 7 am to 7 pm, at other times you can just wait.

Please tell me, do you have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments for a month in advance, at least for a rough understanding of what days?
I'll never remember this schedule)
Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kyiv: they say they have never done this before
Konashenkov's direct speech: "We see attempts at sabotage and strikes by Ukrainian troops on targets in the Russian Federation.
If such incidents continue, the Russian armed forces will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, which the Russian army has previously refrained from doing."
Russians have been launching missile attacks on Kyiv since the first days of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russian occupation forces.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in Poznyaki, Kyiv.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high-rise building on Valeriy Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, Russians hit a TV tower in Dorohozhychi near Babyn Yar, killing 5 passersby.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying toward the Ministry of Defense building over the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, fragments of a downed occupier rocket smashed a house and a trolleybus in Kurenivka, Kyiv.
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area in Vynohradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center in Vynohradar, killing at least 4 people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reiterated on April 13 that it is too early for residents who evacuated the city to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still launch missile strikes on Kyiv, and that there were a lot of mines and unexploded ordnance on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that Russians are planning a series of terrorist attacks on Russian territory to blame Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against civilians.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, local authorities in Belgorod claimed that a "Ukrainian shell" had allegedly fallen near the city.
It is clear that the elites in both Washington and Berlin are breaking out in a cold sweat at the thought of NATO fighter jets shooting down Russian bombers in the skies over Ukraine.
But Zelenskyi is not talking to them so much as to their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of crowds of thousands in the squares of Europe's largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was not available to any of his predecessors.
Zelenskyy is not convincing European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he is convincing the European people who elect those politicians.
And these speeches, this sophisticated fusion of strength, touching and sometimes despair, gradually achieve their goal.
While Biden is categorically against closing the skies, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris and Brussels are against speeding up Ukraine's accession, the process is already underway.
I understand you, so we don't want people to think we are fraudsters.
The money you raise is better spent on people in need.
I can come to you and we can decide on the spot. I'm here to help anyway.

Tell me how you want it, and I will do it.
By the way, you didn't want to write to me today... for some reason
Don't worry, I didn't come to ask for anything.
To be more precise, today I ask only for attention.
I have a lot to say today, so I ask for your patience.
Are you okay with imagination?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan your purchases, and vacation.
You have dreams.
You plan to buy that dress you saw yesterday at the mall.
Tomorrow evening, after work.
Your brain can't process it.
He clings to the old reality.
You call the office to find out whether you have to work today or not.
You decide to leave your children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There is hope... it won't last long.
Now .... will agree... something will happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
I have no one and nowhere to go.
I have 50 dollars in my pocket. We spent the rest at home.
Many of our managers, our supervisors, did not pay us salaries.
Where should I go? Who needs me? How should I provide for my children? Where should I live?
You can't take many things.
You didn't take anything from home... you had to travel 1000 kilometers.
You don't know whether you'll have anything to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag children all over Prague.
And what's next? It is not known. How long? We don't know. The children ask for sweets. But you can't. It's too expensive for you.
And from every iron - we don't have one.
We have a choice - to stay there and endanger the children, or to try to escape here

These are heroic conductors who travel without fear to the war zone, calm and help refugees in the cars, and at peaceful stations help volunteers load humanitarian aid into the cars.
These are the gas station attendants who stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the early days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are utility workers who are removing garbage under fire, repairing water pipes and power lines to provide people with the essentials.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day without complaining about anything, and in their spare time they also volunteer to collect first aid kits for the front line.

I'm looking for an apartment for my daughter and me for 3-4 days every time we come to the Czech Republic and hand over our passports for a visa to Canada.
In Warsaw, there are a lot of people in the visa center and there is no online queue.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's far away, it takes a long time to travel by train, and it will be difficult for the child.
So I decided to look for an apartment in or near Prague.
No, we're fine with everything

A foreign electoral district of Ukraine (FED of Ukraine) is an electoral district that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of voting premises in Ukrainian embassies and consulates and premises at military bases abroad,[footnote 1] where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents are stationed (Kosovo and DR Congo).[1] The Central Election Commission acts as a district election commission for the FED.
Only national elections are held in the Foreign Electoral District: presidential and parliamentary elections and all-Ukrainian referendums.

The head of the President's Office, Andriy Yermak, said that Russia is launching a "fake operation" against weapons that are being transferred to us by our allies.
Yermak's direct speech: "They realize that they are losing the war, see their backwardness, and seek to "knock down" arms supplies by any means necessary.
For example, one of the most recent fakes is the alleged destruction of the S-300 air defense systems transferred by Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What will happen next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. I will name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers are allegedly surrendering with weapons from the allies, and they are being transferred to the Russian army en masse.
I want to warn you about such fakes right away.
Because the weapons in the hands of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exclusively send the enemy to the other side.
Excuse me, I forgot to ask how much the kindergarten will cost per month and whether it will work in the summer?

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence emerged that Russian forces have committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow dismissed the reports as a "provocation."
"The reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian forces are condemnable," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents a "violation of international law."
The statements come after reports that hundreds of civilians were shot and dumped into mass graves or left in the streets in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, by Russian troops who withdrew from the area after occupying it for several weeks.
Photos allegedly showing the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there are signs that Russian troops committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha calls for a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be targeted at Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said that Russian troops could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the allegations as a "provocation."
She claimed, without evidence, that the United States and NATO had "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who 'ordered' this story," Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also claimed without evidence that the image of Bucha was "another production of the Kyiv regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called "a provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
On April 4, Russia's Investigative Committee released a statement announcing an "investigation" into allegations that Ukraine had disseminated "deliberately false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the town and telling Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out," Zelensky said in a video message, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these killings, for these tortures... For the shots in the back of the head," he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held accountable for the actions of troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don't understand," he said of the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a town about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
On April 2, a correspondent of the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty saw the bodies of what appeared to be civilians on the streets of a small town.
In one place alone, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in different places in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people - all in civilian clothes - were scattered on the ground near a place that locals say was used by Russian forces as a base.
The victims appear to have been killed at close range.
In total, Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the Kyiv area, which was controlled by Russian troops until last week.
Thank you, we have everything, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: There is no Kyiv". How the invaders vilely took Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: looting, rape, murder, torture.
This list includes another item about which there is currently much less information - the deportation of the local population to the enemy's territory.
Since about mid-March, the Russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from the temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which self-proclaimed President Lukashenko has effectively given over to a Russian military training ground.
"Ukrayinska Pravda tracked down the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask them how the "evacuation" is going and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text accepted voluntary and forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and out of desperation.
Fortunately, they are alive and in touch with their families.
However, according to statements by the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe coercion.
For example, in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital and took away children without parents, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian swimming champion Yosyp Zachepynskyi.
The family of Oleksandr, Maryna, and their 10-year-old daughter Valia moved to Hostomel a few months before the war.
Oleksandr had just gotten a job at the Antonov airport, located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of a military camp, even though they were civilians.
As true Plast members, Denys and Maryna packed their emergency bags in advance, but did not have time to evacuate on the morning of February 24.
They did not have their own cars, and suburban buses no longer took anyone.
At about 12 p.m. on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a neighboring house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three long weeks, until March 17, when the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 p.m. on February 24, people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian entered the building.
They asked: "Is anyone there?" - I said yes. - "Come out!"
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement and if I had any weapons.
All men were questioned about whether they had served in the army.
The women were told: "We came to protect you on the orders of Ramzan Kadyrov".
It was Chechen riot police, not even troops, young guys of 25-35 years old.
They said: "Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sashko Bilyi (commander of the Viking unit of the UNA-UNSO nationalist movement, which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), and now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we were missing.
We say that water was a big problem.
They smashed the store, took the goods from there under the pretext that the Russians would take them anyway, and brought us six bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for the food.
So it was they who brought sausages after looting the store and said: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child said: "You have 7 days to give us our phones back" - they laughed.
They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they didn't want the war, they support Ukrainians, and they are generally good: "Putin is a bastard, Kadyrov is a bastard, but we can't do anything because our families are there."
And mostly they did not fight, but went to rob shops and loot.
They brought in chickens, tied a St. George's ribbon to one leg and their own white tape to the other, and called it "militia."
They came to Ukraine unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten in Bucha, so badly that they didn't even take the dead, they asked us: "Do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had combined detachments - the Chechens did not know each other, and in the early days they asked for passwords to identify whether they were their own or someone else's.
We had them until March 13, after which the Russian riot police arrived, followed by the Omsk landing party.
They put 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses - ours were constantly hit by Bayraktars.
But these people came and told us that the Armed Forces no longer existed, but that there was Azov, and, according to them, there were 100,000 Azov members in Ukraine.
The "Kyiv has already surrendered" narrative has been promoted since early March.
One day a Russian came to us, either an airborne officer or an FSB representative, and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio - they were talking about Bucha and Gostomel, and we thought that maybe they would give us a "green corridor" as well.
From the very beginning, we gave the Chechens our lists, and they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: "You are being taken to Belarus, and then possibly to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go either way.
To which they replied: "Then take pity on your children's psyche!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house, either with Grads or mortars.
And then it came back... Neighboring houses were burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house was hit directly on the third floor.
Later they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some of them did not go, saying that it was for traitors to the homeland, saying that "you will be shot there and sold for organs."
We were taken through Chornobyl, and on both sides of the road there were burning buildings and broken equipment, although the Belarusians told us that the Russians were taking the equipment to them immediately.
There are a lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Komar checkpoint in Belarus, we went through an improvised control, many of us had no documents at all because they were burned.
We were accommodated in Red Cross tents and given tea.
And then we hear shots! A missile is firing, and you can see the trail - it was an Iskander firing at Kyiv.
Although those from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, these are airplanes flying, turning around at the border."
But we come from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded onto a bus and taken to the Chonki sanatorium near Gomel.
His supervisor, Vasyl Venger, came and said: "Here, I'm a Khokhol, I'm from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves of yours are finished.
The poor people are suffering!
And our Lukashenko is so good!
He will do as he says."
We offered to give an interview to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "You are traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN office (at least that's what they were called) were spreading disinformation that men should not go to Poland.
Many believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we still decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents - my daughter did not have a passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and the war started on Thursday.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us in any way, and in Minsk, at the train station, they said that no one would take anyone on the bus without passports.
Here I would say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were accommodated in Minsk, and we were accompanied.
They did not keep me in the sanatorium by force.
Our second group was told by the migration representative that you can live here for a week and a half at most, because Belarus is not Europe, and there are no benefits here.
We found a domestic carrier who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw ballistic missiles being launched at Ukraine: the missile first takes off, glows beautifully, and then goes out.
People who boarded the bus in Mozyr said that Russians were constantly shooting from firing ranges there.
But I can say that Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals are being dismissed from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something for her son if he was drafted.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is located, does not believe at all.
They said: "You are lying, we are a peaceful people."
They do not accept that their training grounds are used for shelling Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting for us and took us to Estonia.
We are currently registering and deciding what we will do next.
In Estonia, there are probably as many Ukrainian flags as Estonian flags."
Maryna lived in a military camp in Gostomel with her brother's family-his wife and two children, ages 18 and 22.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to gather the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening, they went to spend the night in the basement of a neighboring house.
Maryna herself could not return home and, in principle, will not be able to - the house is gone.
No one really knew anything about the evacuation.
Can't you do it on Monday somewhere in the center?
Thank you, we have everything. And we are always waiting for you!
Thank you for the arrangement, the moths are beautiful

On April 1, Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk announced the good news that the Ukrainian military had liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the occupiers were thrown out of the entire Kyiv region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should have felt at that moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that at least 280 civilians had been shot by Russians in Bucha alone.
They were killed right on the street, some of them had their hands tied and were shot in the back of the head, some of the victims were minors.
The head of the village of Motyzhyn, Olha Suhenko, her husband Ihor and son Oleksandr, who were abducted on March 23, were found dead and with signs of torture.
The bodies of Olha and Oleksandr were in a mass grave, and Ihor's in a sewer.
The bodies of several naked women wrapped in blankets were found on the side of the road 20 kilometers from Kyiv.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I leave, no one will be home

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the President's Office, according to Yevropeiska Pravda.
"All the equipment, everything they are already sending, for some types of equipment it is too late.
Because, for example, when we talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, what do you do now?
I see 100 percent support from the leaders of some countries, it's true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you can see the price of these changes," Zelensky said.
When asked whether Ukraine had received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "Not yet, not yet".
The President also said that if Ukraine had been a member of NATO, this war would not have happened, or it would have had a different look.
"It would have unfolded differently, we would have had the shoulder of close neighbors, we could have fought together.
But I am sure that there would have been no war," he added.
As a reminder, the British Prime Minister has promised Ukraine new military aid, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I have a dream that the war is over and I can return home

Why do people run away?
Why don't they live on the territory where there is no war?
Are you out of your mind?
Did you live in a warring state?
When prices soared by 100-200%.
When the majority of enterprises do not work.
When there is no place to make money.
When do children hear air defense?
Did you live like that?
You have no idea.
And God forbid that they shouldn't.
If you find out, it will be a nightmare.

He was a very wealthy man. After a while, he called and told me that he had undergone heart surgery.
He asked me to just talk to him and support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man and thought that maybe I was his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he made me an offer

"I tell her that the 'repair of the TV and radio' has been delayed because of imported parts, and that her friends and acquaintances have been warned not to say too much when they call."
"For a month we have been hiding information about the war from my mother-in-law.
So far, it has been successful.
However, Plyamka (a cat - UP) has fur on her belly and hind legs - it may be due to stress, a change in food and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but unfortunately, stress is beyond my control.
Unlike her mother-in-law, Plyamka is not deaf, she can hear sirens and explosions."
Due to the fact that Olga is hard of hearing and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in the apartment with her for a month "incognito".
On April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polyova took up arms for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days, I lived with her in an apartment like a partisan.
They hid the war from her, and the fact that I was around - formally, I came as usual for a few hours.
But when her friend spilled the beans, I gave her the receiver - she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours."
The radio was always by my bedside.
My mother-in-law spends most of her time in her room.
She is hard of hearing - this allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "walkers," I would hide in my room.
The first thing I did was hide the receiver and the TV from her.
Then she called everyone who communicates with her. It was 6-7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything but the war.
I'll ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
It is April 17 - I have 2 apartments to clean :)
Good evening, I hadn't thought about it :)

Briton who defended Mariupol in the Ukrainian Armed Forces says he is ready to surrender to Russians
The Briton, who is a member of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Marine Brigade participating in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Sources: Twitter page of Aidan Aislin, a British man who has served in the Ukrainian Armed Forces since 2018, BBC citing family members and friends of Aislin, Atlas News citing a friend of Aislin's who spoke to him
Aislin's Twitter feed: "We received the news from him: "48 days have passed, we have tried everything we can to defend Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian troops.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will end soon."
Details: Eislin served in the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which is taking part in the defense of Mariupol.
BBC journalists contacted the soldier's mother, Anne Wood, and she confirmed that her son had told her by phone that they were planning to surrender.
A friend of the soldier, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that in their last phone conversation, Aislin spoke about their unit's plans to surrender.
According to him, the brigade has run out of ammunition and food.
Atlas News journalists contacted his friend, who said that Eislin's unit intends to surrender to Russian units in order to avoid falling into the hands of the so-called "Kadyrovites" without weapons and bullets.
An audio recording of a telephone conversation was also circulated on social media, in which Eislin allegedly talks to an American friend of his who is planning to travel to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Eislin said that they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but failed.
Earlier, the Briton said that he was threatened on Instagram by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Aislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he left to fight against the so-called Islamic State terrorists in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
Aislin was called Johnny by his friends and family, and he is better known on social media under the nickname Cossack Gundi.

The climate is almost the same.
My family is fine, I have a mother, three brothers and a husband.
One brother is at war in Mariupol, the other in Zaporizhzhia, and today my husband was transferred from Kyiv to Kharkiv.
They call every day and say that everything is fine, but who knows, they won't tell the truth anyway
I wanted to come to you, but I wanted to take care of some things.
I'll ask my husband in the morning if he can make it tomorrow.
When you come home, please write to me, I would need to communicate with Daniel.
The Bolshevik attackers took full revenge for their losses in the battle.
The teacher Dmytro Pavlytskyi, his unknown relative, and a young man, Borys Oleksiyenko, were shot.
Their bodies were thrown into a "deep cesspool, which was covered with earth".
According to his memories, "there was a kind of dead silence in the city."
Occasionally, one of the residents would run from house to house.
The bodies of those tortured by the Bolsheviks were constantly found on the streets
And maybe I will really go after you. I need you. I can't go on without you.
3. What are some of your own activities that would help you or your friends to better adapt to life in the Czech Republic?
But you won't get there because the railroad is being reconstructed and the entrance is closed.

I'm not afraid of work, as I also lived in the countryside, so I can and do like to work physically.

It's a very interesting tradition you have, we do it for Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada passed draft law 7176, entitled "On Monitoring Potential Threats to Ukraine's National Security in the Economic Sphere."
It is surprising that in fact the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere was... the place where the supervisory boards of state-owned companies and state-owned banks meet.
The initiators of the draft law believe that decision-making by the supervisory board of a state-owned company in a fictitious Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of Ukraine's national security.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but we are not aware of any company that has had to physically hold supervisory board meetings at its location.
The potential threat of such a law is clear: it is an excellent basis to "tear down" all the gains made in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establish manual control.
The way it was before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies need supervisory boards and who should be on them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill takes off under patriotic slogans, tomorrow others may take off as well - for example, the public procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU may be demolished.
Much can be attributed to the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the war and draft law 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this provision was included in the comparative table of the draft law 5397.
In general, the desire to dissolve supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some MPs for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the draft law, we will analyze the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such an innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which would make it impossible for supervisory boards to work remotely.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, which may paralyze the company's operations.
We agree that there is such a risk, but can it be prevented by the relocation of supervisory board members to Ukraine?
Let's imagine a rather cynical situation where independent members of supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) put their personal safety above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they can be fired.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum required for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to appoint new independent members of the supervisory board quickly, as the law requires a competitive selection process that takes 3-4 months on average.
Therefore, the solution proposed by draft law 7176 is unlikely to prevent the supervisory board from losing its ability to make decisions, but rather will lead to this!
MP Dmytro Natalukha, the author of the draft law, provides other arguments in support of it.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, including the defense industry, now need to relocate" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vienna via Zoom."
To begin with, there are almost no state-owned defense enterprises in Ukraine that have supervisory boards.
Only Ukroboronprom has a supervisory board, which in fact manages almost all state-owned defense enterprises.
But even in Ukroboronprom, according to the law, the supervisory board has rather limited powers, and all its members do not perform their duties on a free basis.
All power in Ukroboronprom belongs to the Director General, who, incidentally, will decide on the need to relocate a particular defense industry enterprise that is part of the concern.
In addition, this argument does not stand up to criticism because Draft Law 7176 does not introduce any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned defense companies.
On his Facebook page, Mr. Dmytro also cites arguments that can be categorized as "emotional".
Such arguments usually have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let's try to analyze some of them: "respected foreign experts leave Ukraine at the first word "war" in 2021, but remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself is really suffering from the war."
First, it is a manipulation - most of these supervisory board members have never lived in Ukraine and only came here periodically.
Therefore, it is unfair to say that they are "leaving Ukraine," to put it mildly.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been widespread in global practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
It should also be remembered that being a member of the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other jobs, and electronic communication tools help them with this.
Third, all these statements are read as claims exclusively against foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not make identical claims against members of supervisory boards who are Ukrainians.
After all, they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt by MPs to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is just a new convenient opportunity.

A 2-day curfew will be imposed in Brovary, Vyshgorod and Bucha districts of Kyiv region, which have been liberated from the occupiers.
Pavliuk's direct speech: "The curfew has been tightened in the settlements of Brovary, Vyshhorod and Bucha districts that were under Russian occupation and liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces!
The restrictions will be in effect from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5 in these towns and villages."
Details: According to the head of the regional military administration, it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and other public places, to travel by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during the alarm to take shelter.
Such restrictions are being imposed in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression - to clear and demine the territories.
Omelyanyuk urged people who left these areas to refrain from returning home for the time being.
On the rest of the Kyiv region, the curfew will last from 21:00 to 6:00 every day.

There is a word-for-word translation of that document in Czech.
I added an explanation of what inkaso is at the bottom.

The Serbian defense budget has been growing exponentially for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in modernizing its army, updating military equipment, and purchasing modern systems, rising 22 places in the list of the world's most powerful military powers.
After Russia's full-scale aggression against Ukraine, Western countries took the predictions of a possible escalation in the Balkans quite seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complex and globalized.

The Lukashenko regime's security forces detained three Belarusians aged 27 and 28 involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signal installation near Osipovichi, which ensures the movement of railroad trains.
Source: "Radyye Svaboda", human rights center "Viasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state news agency "BelTA"
The Belarusian Interior Ministry reported that on the night of March 30, three residents of Bobruisk were detained with the forceful support of SOBR special forces, one of them was wounded.
According to Vyasna, the men actively resisted arrest and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were provided with medical care on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Belarusian Interior Ministry, Gennady Kazakevich, said that "acts of terrorism on the Belarusian railroad will be severely suppressed" by security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian Railways, an employee of the Baranovichi branch of the Belarusian Railways and the administrator of the Belarusian Railways' thematic resources on VKontakte and Odnoklassniki, Valentin Samasiuk.
It is unknown where he is now and in what condition, @belzhd_live reports.
In late March, at least 40 railroad workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
To recap: The BYpol formation, declared extremist by Lukashenka's regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage at railway transport and infrastructure facilities in Belarus as part of the Peramogha plan.
Belarusian "railroad partisans" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, Russia is sending manpower and equipment to Ukraine through Belarus to fight.

Temporarily for the period while we are looking for a university, then of course we will need permanent residence
but maybe she will have a hostel. (We are looking for Prague, Brno, and other places)
We are now not far from Prague, we have a car, and we are ready to partially pay for accommodation.
city or village does not matter, it should be a separate apartment.
I bumped into something in the vodafone and connected two unnecessary promotions for which I was charged and I can't turn them off üò≠
and also withdrew money from a card that did not have any money on it
and I do not understand why the money was withdrawn
The cost of the repair is paid by the owner, Mr. Dedina. He is expected to show up on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, stay home and wait for the repairmen.
Is it fashionable to ask you for one cigarette?

US bans investments in Russia and imposes sanctions on Putin's daughters
The United States, along with the G7 and the EU, impose new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, Russia's largest banks, Alfa Bank and Sberbank, and ban all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in a statement on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest government-owned financial institution in Russia, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the US financial system and prohibit US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will impose a complete ban on new investments in Russia.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new executive order that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the decision taken by more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
Private sector withdrawals include manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as law and consulting firms," the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new US sanctions was restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sector.
This will prohibit US citizens from conducting transactions with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the US jurisdiction.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the next day, on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is a complete freeze on the assets of Putin's adult children, Foreign Minister Lavrov's wife and daughter, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including former President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
The sanctions cut them off from the US financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.
You will be able to get only to this place, then the road is closed and I will come to you
Vera, can we wash the dishes in the car now?
My name is Olga, before the war I worked as a flight attendant for SkyUp, my mother is a seamstress of industrial products, and my son Makarchyk went to kindergarten.
We were living a wonderful life, but we did not even think that we would be forced to flee, because we had no strength to hide in the cellar.
I was lucky and found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
So we hope that someone will take us in for the first time.) We can even pay for a room or apartment, but only if we can afford it.
We guarantee cleanliness and order.
We have no bad habits.
We will be grateful for such assistance at such a difficult time for us.
I had one English lecture in the afternoon and then went to work in the children's room.
There I explained to Margarita how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she understands everything and does well.
I also met Ms. Lena and talked to her about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought the announcement from the pool.
It's free swimming.

Unfortunately, I don't have the program, but I'll try to figure it out.
I dreamed of being a teacher
My girls can't move anywhere yet, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you to let me know if you hear anything about the housing.
I would love to rent a house with a decent girl.

For my part, I will not let you down.
Thank you in advance.

We will do it somehow.
But how will it be paid for, please, no loans.
Write to me directly and I will help.
We are your partner, or I am not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
Should I take the clothes they gave me with me?
Today is not my day. the blinds in the living room broke. one in the morning, another in the evening
Something came from you, I can't see what it is
I am also very sad
I will remind you about the invoice later
Is your father the only one who speaks and understands Russian?
What day does the colleague want the house cleaned and how many windows does the house have?
I am ashamed to distract you from your work
Good evening, I can't help but share this with you. I have news from Mariupol about my son - he is alive and in the ranks.
I advise you to read Joe Dispenza, he scientifically conducts research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons of connections
A journalist of the 1+1 TV channel Natalia Nagorna released a video on the morning of April 12, which was handed over to her by soldiers of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military say they have no weapons left to fight and a mountain of wounded.
They said that "it's a matter of hours".
Prior to that, on April 11, the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, which is participating in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and that the Ukrainian military command had not contacted the fighters for two weeks.
Social media expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
Chief Commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhny assured that the command is in touch with the defense forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defense operation should not be subject to public discussion.
Russians threatened to block Ukrainian soldiers on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
In the evening of April 11, Russian occupants dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to Azov leader Andriy Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons on the Azovstal plant, which is held by Azov regiment fighters.
Thank you, I will adjust to you. That would be very good.
The situation is the same, we are still here
2 hours drive)) walks, mom shopping and back)!
It's not a big deal
She forgot what she was going to do here
A squadron of —á–µ—Å—å–∫–∏—Öüá®üáø drones has started flying over –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–æ—éüá∫üá¶ today.
Almost 50 professional coptersüöÅ will be used to detect and some of them - to directly destroy the enemy invaderüí•.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to Mukachevo City Council member Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today, their friends from Mizhhirya, led by Vasyl Shchur, head of the village council and coordinator of https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/, delivered the drones to their intended destination: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in various cities where combat operations are currently underway.
To ensure the most efficient and safe use of the copters, we will keep their locations secret for now.
The four friends who are helping the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic are not planning to stop there, saying that in the coming days they will send many more interesting "gifts" to Ukraine that will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I didn't worry, everything is fine. I like sweets, but I can do without them
I'm worried we won't make it in time. There's a lot of luggage.
I will soon return to Ukraine to continue working
Okay. If everything goes well, I'll agree
I will try to do it myself, but if I have any problems I will write to you, if that's okay?
The main thing is to understand each other
We went to the village headwoman in Yivov, she saw me and that I was pregnant, but she said there was no housing available.
Maybe she will be happy and her mood will improve
I had my phone repaired today.
And I think that today I also froze outside.
I took some medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critically.
I'm sorry too, but it's better to meet when I'm healthy.

I'm interested in what your musical overcoming is üòä
Mom and dad must be obeyed
You will find it somewhere near your little brother's stroller.
Today it was cooler and rained. Tomorrow it should be warm.
But I don't feel sorry for the destroyed houses, I feel sorry for the people who are being abused by the occupiers
In Kherson, the occupiers mocked the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopska Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore down the flag of the European Union, smashed panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers tore down portraits of the Heavenly Hundred heroes and fallen participants in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They took down the flag.
Good morning, thank you children for the carol, we don't have such a custom, so we didn't know, we gave the children only chocolate and cookies, maybe we should have given them something else
There is someone to talk to in Czech, if necessary.
Because I live in a dormitory, there will be people here until twelve, and then they go to work
Hi, I'm feeling a little better.
Today he was already in the nursery.
Even today I have already slept there.
So we have already made great progress.
I'll definitely bring dumplings another time!
I don't have the strength to do them today
Since I start from the days and times when I have to clean apartments after guests, I can say approximately for the month of April because I already have a rough schedule for cleaning apartments.
As for May, I'll be able to say approximately in late April or early May.
I was just asking if you had heard anything about it.
Hi, sorry I haven't written back for a long time, I was cooking dinner and sleeping a little

Hi) everything went very well.
I was a little shocked to work with people in such a high position.
Today I had a lesson with a lady who is the director of the Vysocina region's economic department.
She was very pleased with my work.
Hryshko behaved well in the nursery.
On Monday, I have to bring a confirmation of employment and a cash payment for the nursery.

If I'm not mistaken, you are celebrating Easter today, right?
From the very beginning, we didn't really want you to raise funds, so that people wouldn't think we were speculating on it!
But two points were not enough for me to fill out online:
I'm going to go to bed to rest. To gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Good night.
üòÑüòçWhat a great idea. I'll watch the video now. It will be good because the whole family will draw.
Karazin University urges its employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.

Yes, you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who stayed in Ukraine, is also helping the army.
I collected several works for my portfolio.
After the holidays, the Internet is to be restored.
I would like to be your backup designer.
How will the day I was absent from work be counted as a pass?
Staff report: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state."
Literally: "It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation will carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to build up an offensive group of troops for operations in the Slobozhansky sector.
It is likely that in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are being trained at the permanent deployment point of the 60th separate motorized rifle brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
Presumably, these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region.
In addition, to restore the losses of personnel of the battalion tactical group of the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzya, Zabaikalsky Krai) of the 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District, military personnel from the said brigade are being recruited.
The enemy faces a particular problem in recruiting drivers and driver mechanics.
The departure of the selected personnel from the permanent deployment point is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the enemy will continue to strike at transport infrastructure on the territory of Ukraine to disrupt the supply of goods to the combat zone in order to destroy or disable it.
Designated units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansky sector, some units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and the Northern Fleet Coastal Troops continue to partially block the city of Kharkiv, and artillery shelling of certain districts of the city continues.
Aerial reconnaissance continues in the Izyum sector to identify the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
For this purpose, the enemy uses Orlan-10 UAVs.
With up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy attempted to launch an offensive in the direction of Dovhenke and Dmytrivka, but failed and retreated to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk sector, the enemy continues to focus its main efforts on taking control of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nyzhne and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to conduct an assault in the area of Zolote, but was unsuccessful.
In the city of Mariupol, the occupiers continue to assault the Azovstal plant and the seaport with artillery and aircraft.
The enemy used separate units to shell Ukrainian troops' positions near Vysokopillia, Trudolyubivka and Maryanske.
Ukrainian troops repelled four enemy attacks in Donetsk and Luhansk regions over the past day, destroying five tanks, eight armored vehicles, six vehicles and eight enemy artillery systems.
I don't understand your thoughts?
We will certainly try to make it, but I doubt it.
How can you be so sleepy and I'm keeping you up?
Are you sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, so tell me, I'll understand)
Thank you. We didn't watch TV at home, let alone 1+1. No need to tune us in :)
I turn on the TV here only to listen to the Czech language
My monthly package is ending today :)
Can we do it over the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, embroidery threads
I understand, so I can prepare material in this area.
I'll ask her. I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she gives us a lot of pies already.
We'll meet my father later, for sure üôèüèª
I read the ad on Facebook, so I guess Google is doing something in its own way –Ω–∞–ø–∏—Å–∞–≤üèµÔ∏è., I think the phone number is enough
Good afternoon, we have taken the things you brought, but there are some things that are too small for us, can we bring them to you in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If Mr. Director is satisfied, I can start working next week, because tomorrow I plan to go to the labor office to submit documents (if I can, because there are very long lines) and it's raining on Saturday :)
I'm looking for a team to start with, I liked chemistry at school, I'm learning Czech to be fluent, I dream of working for Teva
Old and not so old friends, friends I don't know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now you are also facing hard times.
Over the past month, I have been in touch with many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has been turned upside down, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that you feel guilty and ashamed of your country's actions towards your neighbors.
Because of what Ukraine is being subjected to on your behalf.
Some of you activists have been threatened for a long time, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, a very old friend of mine from Memorial.
"I'll tell you a little later," Sasha replied laconically, as usual, "Now, after the search, we are walking through the ruins.
Others - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - are shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: with the exception of a very few of you-those who worked at Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Ekho Moskvy, Meduga, Navalny's organization, and a number of other places-how many of you did anything to resist this regime?
Except for participating in the rallies when they were still taking place.
Read also the column by the Russian journalist "It's too late to hide, too late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your prolonged indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which must now be a great burden on your heart and soul?
This was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you had freedom and democracy to a certain extent - messy, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the back of the tsar, even if his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still feel safer around him. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of seizing and making public the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you laid your souls to rest at the Dzerzhinsky monument and allowed the KGB to lie low, renew itself, reform, and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between the plunder of the country and the return of the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option and meekly accepted the plunder.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and that marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin came along. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to crack down on terrorists and boost the economy.
Few of you bought into it, but you either voted for him anyway, or preferred not to vote at all.
When he started razing Chechnya to the ground again, most of you turned a blind eye.
I remember those years well.
At the time, I was working in Chechnya, helping victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation," and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Katar-Yurt, Itum-Kala, and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I would come back to Moscow and have fun with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the murder of children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me: "Brad, we're tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
In response, I was indignant: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
It's your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your government that bombs one of your cities, kills your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic boom of the mid-noughties, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look the other way when some of the stolen money remained in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have started earning good money, some of you have become rich, and even the poorest of you have bought new homes and found better jobs.
Prices were rising, but who cares?
Moscow was festively shining and glistening with chic.
When several opposition members were killed - Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others - many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.
However, it did not go any further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the presidency to Medvedev and took over as prime minister, you barely paid attention to it.
When, after a few months of Medvedev's rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or remained silent.
How many of you did I meet in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi, or in cafes and Turkish baths in Tbilisi while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I must admit that we in the West have hardly done much, if anything, either.
Some outrage, some sanctions; but what did it matter that Russia was blatantly violating international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas, and the domestic market was so great?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, this was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, did wake up.
When Putin switched places with Medvedev again and took the presidency as before, many of you thought it was too much, and you came out in droves to protest.
Navalny's name became a household name, you didn't leave the streets for six months, and the regime finally realized with horror that it was losing ground.
He then struck back.
At first, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were imprisoned.
Some of them got huge sentences.
"What could we do?"
I heard it so often and I still hear it.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angry with a pro-Russian president who had deceived their European hopes, they took over the Maidan once and never left.
They set up a tent city on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to demolish it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, rebar and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters attacked.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained their democracy, the right to choose their own leaders and to expel them if they do not do their job well.
Putin did not like the Maidan very much.
It was a bad example.
So, taking advantage of the general confusion, he seized Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but there was little use in that.
And how many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
A new myth suddenly emerged from somewhere, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
It's hard for me to find a reason because we stopped communicating immediately after that.
The rest of my friends were mostly silent.
"We are not interested in politics," you said.
And you hid again in books, movies, Ikea catalogs, and parks, brand new after the restoration that the mayor of Moscow began in 2012, with their bingo halls, public Wi-Fi, and hipster cafes.
It's true that Donbass is far away, but Moscow is so beautiful - and it's only getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists there, weren't there?
ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview because I seemed to have no idea what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw for myself how state snipers were shooting my children's peers in cold blood on the streets of Homs.
Among all Russian citizens, only your soldiers were there, and in 2015 they began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next major war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niemiller:
"At first they came for the socialists, but I kept quiet because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for trade union members, but I kept silent because I am not a trade union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I kept silent because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defense."
How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you have done it.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some people are actually speaking out now, such as Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov, and others.
Most of them allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from inside the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking being put in a new Gulag or keeping Navalny company.
As for the others, you know best what country you live in.
So I'm sure you understand that when Putin has dealt with the Ukrainians - or, as seems very likely, if he fails to do so - he will take on you.
To all of you, my friends: to those who bravely, but mostly alone, went out to protest and have so far gotten off with a short sentence, but will soon get a more serious one.
To the thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed your disagreement on social media (even if it was just a black square on Instagram), or who spoke out in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years in prison were given simply for an anecdote are not so distant in the past - and now they are likely to be waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will be left?
The example of the Ukrainians scares the Putin regime even more than in 2014: they prove that it can be fought.
And that intelligence, motivation, and courage can stop him, no matter how overwhelming his advantage may be on paper.
Yet few people in Russia realize this, or that there is a war going on at all.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows that you know.
So be on the lookout.
You understand where this is going.
The good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are a joke, your laws, except for the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper they are written on, your last free media is gone, your economy is collapsing faster than I am writing, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if there are still some flights left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your submission.
And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try to leave somehow or you will be crushed.
I doubt that you see any other option.
And yet there is still one more.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And perhaps in the current environment, less will be required of you than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not come from you: because of the economic collapse that is looming in Russia, it will most likely ignite in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices soar and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this, and he is much more afraid of these people than he is of the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city holds rallies on its own, as it has done from time to time, it will not be difficult for them to suppress them one by one.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool, the Internet, which the regime may limit, but which still works and which can be set up in almost any circumstance.
Navalny's organization was defeated, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized organizations.
There are many of you, millions of you.
The Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets, maybe a hundred thousand.
If it turns out to be more than 300 thousand, she will be stunned.
We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes down to it?
After everything he put them through in Ukraine, everything he put them through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel understandable fear; those with children will fear for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
If I were you, I would be afraid too.
Using the example of Syria and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to disobey their master, who dare not only to demand freedom but actually try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will make a joke in the chat room of a computer game and be arrested; your daughter will express her indignation on the Internet and be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake and die in a damp cell under police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years now, and it will only get worse, gaining larger and larger proportions.
So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.
Act cool, think strategically, and make it happen.
We were in class on Friday, we were told that we could come back on Monday
We'll be home in the evening
That you perceive me as a press secretary
Vika, how often do you go out to dinner at an expensive restaurant?
Once a week I go out to dinner at an expensive restaurant

Yes, we liked it very much and wanted something closer, so this is the best option
I was in a room with a lot of people. I was tired energetically.
I feel sick, coughing, fever, lost my voice, weakness and dizziness
