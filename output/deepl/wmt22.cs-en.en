The big return of the Czech underdog is coming.
Pavel Francouz called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a tough time in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The thirty-one year old Pilsen native will be on the bench and could soon be in goal.
The former goaltender of Litvínov, Plzen and Chelyabinsk was injured in October this year in preparation for the NHL.
He was substituted in the middle of the game with Vegas and has not appeared in the NHL since.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to the other.
"Pavel Francouz will be out approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the Denver team announced in early October.
His return to the NHL was extended for more than two months.
He was called up from the farm on Sunday morning, where he played four games and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he had 94.5% of his saves.
The Pilsen-born hockey player wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs in the best league in the world.
He had hip problems last year and didn't play a single game in the shortened pandemic year.
In the NHL, "The Frenchman" has played 36 games and his save percentage is 92.3%.
Charles puts Camilla's veil on Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas card.
Prince Charles also made his wish public, using a photo of him helping his daughter Camilla put on a veil at the races.
The British news channel BBC reported on its website.
They send their wishes to friends, colleagues and foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is wearing a long khaki summer dress and Princess Charlotte is also wearing a dress.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, wears shorts and a collared shirt like Princes George and Louis.
Who took the photo, William and Kate did not specify, nor is it clear when exactly it was taken.
Last year, for a photo intended as a Christmas card, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk.
The image, which serves as a Christmas card, was also posted by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them in June at Ascot Racecourse.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat and a face veil, helps Camille to put on her veil, which is colour-coordinated with her light-coloured dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - Criminal investigators in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that Roman Berbr, the accused former vice-chairman of the Czech Football Association, was promised CZK 1 million by Prague-based Slavia for the 2018/19 league title.
The server efotbal.cz reported that it had accessed part of the police files.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, chairman of the board of directors of the club, said the Red and Whites had not committed any corrupt acts.
The server has published a transcript of police wiretaps, which mainly feature Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who quit the championship club last summer.
According to the case file, the former influential Red and White official was in frequent contact with both Berber and Roman Rogoz, the former sports director of the then second-league Vyšehrad team, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminals allegedly worked with information that Slavia promised Berbrov a financial reward if he won the title.
2019 SK Slavia Praha won the first league title.
The police authority had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was promised a million-dollar bribe by SK Slavia Prague officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to criminal investigators, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with Tvrdík, the chairman of the board of directors of Slavia.
According to the server, the file no longer shows whether the police are still looking into this information.
Tvrdík has denied any corrupt behavior.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never committed any illegal acts, we have never sought to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play and we have never provided any financial compensation to anyone in this regard," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former Slavia players of dark skin and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was sparked by a police raid in mid-October last year at several locations, including the Prague headquarters of the FAČR.
The most senior figure in the affair is Berbr, who is no longer involved in any football functions.
In mid-January, Rogoz was released from custody, as was the former sports director of Vyšehrad.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping the cold war.
The guns will be new, but basically of an inferior type (gunners have to get out of the armoured cab and carry the shells by hand without cover).
The cars - Toyotas hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, plus they've managed to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: fighter- decent but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with short range but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we don't have any (but we produce and export abroad)
PVO: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good numbers.
I have a story.
I got a hunting ground right next to town.
Nutria were crawling out of the river and doing damage to the crops, so I sat there.
As I approached, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he would leave before anything came out, but of course the fox went in a moment.
I let her come within 40 yards before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost shit himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
By the time I got off the seat, he was gone.
I mean, even a meadow can be a bummer.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably be seen in a thermal imaging camera, which almost everyone has nowadays.
So put your expensive stuff in a visible place, put it at your feet in your sleeping bag and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Interior Ministry got respirators much cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for purchasing and distributing respirators, masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns in recent weeks to acquire them.
The server iRozhlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that within a single day the amounts for the respirator varied by hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy more?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with the editor of the iRozhlas server Dominika Kubištová.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I guess I am not affected by the memories of the CSLA that the older generations went through), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory war.
We don't even have large stores of equipment for the trained to use, we don't really have modern equipment even for the current professionals, plus modern equipment is getting more and more complex so the abilities of the reservists will be rapidly diminishing over time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts where anyone can deploy them will happen very quickly, there won't be time to train anyone again.
And finally, reservists/territorial defense is of great importance for countries like Ukraine, where it is possible to lead a mass guerrilla and it is also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the only way to fight will be in a conflict of such scale and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not even have a suitable geography.
we don't have individual skill.
That's not even the worst part.
The worst part is that half of them play like they have it.
Then there are situations like that, you watch a dude who missed an empty net 2 minutes ago, runs into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you think "what do you think is going to happen now?".
Well, of course they're gonna take him like the average taxpayer.
The "take a defender" situation is so bad that I found myself honestly surprised to see that our striker managed to get around one of the opponent's players.
The first swallows
The epidemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major reversal for the next few weeks.
The onslaught in hospitals, according to statistical models, will continue for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course, to what extent vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired through previous experience of the disease helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon also entered the covid equation this week on the plus side: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalisation by a third and can be treated at home.
And it should soon be complemented by Pfizer's paxlovide, which reports a success rate of 85 percent so far.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, however, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how prepared the local administration is for the incoming drugs.
As mentioned, Merck's molnupiravir will be the first to reach domestic patients.
The company also ended up first on the tape because the drug began development long before the current pandemic broke out, with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for the viral disease in horses on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to saying "how our beaks have grown".
See you do a survey asking people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you no without hesitation.
In the West they will tell you how they love migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing their jobs and a media lynch mob.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But he's going to find out what people really think.
In France alone, Le Pen and Zemmour, both polling over 20%.
We even know that the objects are three in Czech and completely identical.
Identical because of the rotation of units, so that soldiers don't have to relearn where what is, so all objects are exactly the same.
One is the Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR didn't want nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for security reasons or the speed of deploying warheads because of its more westerly location.
Those underground shelters ( there are two in each maple tree) only held warheads not whole missiles as they say.
If there was a need to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived to retrieve the warhead and mount it on some sort of support device.
Except for the museum maple, the remaining ones are in a desolate state.
In the second grade of primary school we had a Gypsy classmate, we were with him for 4 years.
He was pretty cool, he made good jokes, he was often a bit too expressive, but he was our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he came often and wanted to explain things, he missed little, came regularly, played sports with us, didn't steal snacks or phones, came cleanly dressed.
He also went to outdoor schools, did all sorts of monkey business, but he was fine, hopefully never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the siblings, gypsies, entered the same year, a different class.
Shortly thereafter, they beat up a teacher, the police were often there to deal with them, and they threatened and endangered other students.
Personally, I occasionally sell something on an advert (old stuff, something I don't need etc) and I've often sold to gypsies, they've always had the money, they didn't make any attempts to stretch me on the price, communication was calm.
I even sold a car this way, the guy called a month later to say he had already signed it over.
I myself say that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (working, working, not beating women, just normal behaviour).
But if someone comes in, reaches out, trashing apartments and houses, just messing around, making trouble... it doesn't matter what color they are, they're going to bother me.
I don't have a problem with African migrants if they join us, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
Young woman died in car crash in Prachatice
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot despite resuscitation care," Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokesperson for the South Bohemian paramedics, told Právo.
The crash was probably the fault of the driver carrying the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot was probably travelling in the direction from Žíchovec to Bavorov and, for unknown reasons, drove into the opposite direction at a bend.
After the collision with the Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot ended up on its roof off the road, described the accident by Štěpánka Schwarzová, spokesperson for the South Bohemian Police.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
These were multiple injuries and he remained wedged in the car.
After being rescued, he had to be given acute pre-hospital care and was airlifted to the hospital in České Budějovice in a stable condition, said paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to non-EU parcels, customers often fail to provide details
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collectible cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free," the collector explains.
Since October, ordering small parcels has become slightly more expensive, and he must now add VAT and submit data to the post office for customs clearance.
He receives an email telling him that customs is expecting a package.
Then you just need to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the trader did not include the VAT at the time of sale, the customs office will charge it on the total amount of the shipment and transport.
If the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the carrier's remuneration must be added to the total amount.
But according to Lukáš Neuheisel, the whole process is not complicated.
I tick one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, Neuheisl says.
But not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Due to new customs rules, the daily number of parcels received from abroad at the International Post Office in Prague dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, another problem is that people are not responding to requests to supply the data needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 shipments at the international post office that we have to process.
If people filled in all the information that is needed and filled it in on time, we would be about halfway there, says Matyáš Vitík, spokesman for the Czech Post.
Tackling inflation
See the headline, how would you propose to deal with the current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and inflation is expected to rise further.
What do you think the state should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
For example, we see in Poland a reduction in VAT on food and fuel, is this the way to go for you?
What do you think is going to happen that is inevitable with where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, and I think it's inevitable that people won't be able to afford everyday things, especially energy.
For example, how much of a raise did you get (who is an employee)?
I got a 2% gross raise this year, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I run while employed.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why proven convicted rapists are only put behind bars for, say, 6 months?
This just boggles my mind how a court can send such an animal behind bars for only 6 months only to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will be traumatized for years, negatively affecting his/her sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention that the rape victim may never recover either.
Won't this also discourage potential future rape victim reporting?
A man from Hrob "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from Hrob inadvertently helped officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, who was the subject of an arrest warrant.
For he himself summoned them to her.
But he took a roundabout way of doing it.
First, he approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
The officers arrived at the scene after calling the emergency line and were not surprised when the alleged "robbed" man told them he had made the whole thing up so the officers would come to the scene.
In reality, he only wanted the officers to advise him on how to file a report with the Czech Police.
When officers checked the identities of the man and his girlfriend, they discovered that the woman was on a national wanted list and had a warrant out for her arrest.
The case is therefore being investigated by the Czech Police.
Honest question for the people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we are not Slavs ethnically or culturally anymore, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise I agree with the meme of course, too bad Churchill couldn't secure the liberation of Prague for the US :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well I don't know, it's quite questionable whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit them.
Personally, I would not consider such a case to be a true belief.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are an estimated, if I'm not mistaken, something like ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should one then choose?
I'd say it's quite likely that in any of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
However, the Decalogue also states that there is no god but Yahweh.
In such a case, wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god, rather than risk choosing the wrong one out of thousands of gods and having the one real god I just missed send me to hell or some such place?
Other: voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in the reserves.
I think the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months per one) and under the command of pros with practical experience.
If a person does well he can get a pro offer.
All branches of the Army could use something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can talk like this: There is a constant mention of cooperation between the education sector and industry, companies are hunting in schools and there is a kind of intermingling, where the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment.
Not only in growing up, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar overlap should exist between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or a Mongolian invader will never invade here again.
I find it funny how you consider NATO to be something set in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is a screw up.
Oh, my goodness.
All it takes is one election in the US to cut their budget and the whole of NATO goes to shit.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already proven that all they have to do is show their backs and they will take what they want.
The only thing that works in the long term as a guarantor of independence is an armed army and a population that knows how to operate the military technology of its time.
And every teenager can pilot remote-controlled vehicles these days, so what's not to like.
We don't need border fortifications, that's shit nowadays, but a pimply teenager behind a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How not to drown in the box tsunami
Unwrapping presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are at home overwhelmed with boxes and fillers?
This "waste" is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
We have therefore created a map of shops that will welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
It is therefore a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to a participating shop (the map of the KAMsNIM.cz project contains nearly 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overflowing blue bins.
The shops themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, and also the money saved, as packaging cartons have risen in price by 50% in recent years.
In addition, I am strengthening my brand in the eyes of environmentally conscious customers.
One of these shops is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-drug and eco-cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are brought to Popůvek u Brna by individuals who accumulate them at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collections of discarded cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Together, individuals and companies are creating a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the www.KAMsNIM.cz app does not only show collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to dispose of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to take expired medicines, tires, used electrical equipment, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All the rubbish can end up in the right place, plus reusable items can find a second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such sites.
"It is gradually adding collection yards, re-use centres, containers for textiles, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find uses for things that would otherwise become waste", adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the app from the Ukliďme Česko association.
I find it rather wrong that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that kids who use a computer or a phone play games on it but don't learn basic computer skills in the process.
Recently there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that college students do not understand the principle of folders on the computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple's photo app or actually mobile phones in general just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and put everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use the technique from childhood, but most importantly, let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron's presentation of the priorities of the French EU presidency over the weekend - starting in January - was spectacular.
Macron spoke for more than an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many events that it is impossible to do them in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters straddling right and left agree on little, but they do on Europe.
And in France there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The electoral calendar has also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately rushed to criticize Macron for being pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, they are more trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is now touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and he is having quite a bit of success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea for a history textbook seriously and ignore what is happening in France.
Wouldn't she be needed?
Students in European countries are often taught history as an us versus them story and never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, French, Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But unless they have an enlightened cantor, they will no longer know what the wider context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which revisits the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also won awards for direction and best actress for Jasna Duricic.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he was at the top of the audience ranking.
Anthony Hopkins won Best Actor in Berlin for Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was about like "having the flu/being cold" I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't really feel like smoking...
Compared to the regular flu, it was worse.
I don't get diarrhea with the flu.
(Just a personal experience. I'm not saying that everybody does)

A story about a return to one's roots, which turns out to be a longed-for illusion.
The bohemian and comparatist translates the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood into the setting of a contemporary village.

And that the road back to instinct is shorter than one is willing to admit
In his penultimate novel, the author tells a much less sentimental story of his return from emigration than we have become accustomed to hearing.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make it worth living together.
Trains start running according to the new timetable, in some places the carriers will change
From Sunday, trains will start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts running instead of České dráhy.
For most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, or even the route slightly.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The carriers started selling tickets during the autumn.
In the new timetable, ČD plans to run an average of 6,783 passenger transport connections per day, of which 478 will be long-distance trains on average.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic services, the new timetable will also include services to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will deploy dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains that will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be dispatched by the carrier in northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares from next year by an average of 3.2 percent.
Railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of the R23 line Ústí nad Labem - Mělník - Nymburk - Kolín.
The carrier will be replaced by České dráhy after its success in the Ministry of Transport competition.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 connections on the line daily, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations.
Leo Express retained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to the spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to keep the journey times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible despite the planned closure works.
The operation of trains of Arriva and other carriers should continue without major changes.
Carriers will also be replaced on some regional lines.
Changes await passengers, for example, in the Českolipsko region, where Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of ČD.
For the second year, passengers will also be able to use a single rail fare.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Don't we learn the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work and die.
I've never in my life heard teaching from the slave party's point of view or from that era, no one is advocating this, just condemning it.
No one even tells you in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slave owners.
Nobody teaches you in school that colonizers often bought land from Indians, everywhere they just tell you how brutally we Europeans murdered them, while they murdered each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the US, right in the schools, both in the more northern schools and in the southern schools.
I haven't come across anyone deliberately withholding facts, but I've heard it happening before and I think it's a problem, I don't deny that (for example, in Japan, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about anyone's feelings, it just is what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to pass judgment without the perspective of the times.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, speaking of those Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slaveholders are quite popular there, on the other hand, they had some good accomplishments of their own and I found it absurd to dismiss them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people nowadays idealize it.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slaveholder, and they resented a lot of things too.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately leave out some facts, lie and manipulate, and our viewpoint doesn't exist (there was a video on YT where they shut down someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I thought it was horrible at some universities, the students were quite radicalised and the schools encouraged them to do so.
And when I imagine that these people will one day be much older, it makes me a little sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because there is one among the young, and even among the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism, for example, has long since achieved what it was supposed to and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become radicalised.
Nowadays, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological facts are labelled as feminists, as are other groups like LGBT, and it leads to radicalisation on the other side, where it often leads to resistance even on quite sensible things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I also haven't encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
More like I encountered bad geography, but that was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely irrelevant.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality in general to be unnecessary in terms of any personal identity.
If I have anything in common with people it is interests, world views and shared experiences, not where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovak pastor is a very nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he's always yapping about the coronavirus, which makes everyone ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic Modernism and are effectively Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic but go to Hussite services because it's theologically very similar, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael in Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans, and they even do a Mass there every Sunday at 3:00 p.m. in Latin, as they did before Vatican II.
The flamingo from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav - The flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
However, the scouts did not go to Vienna to get it this time because of the coronavirus pandemic, but in the morning they took it from their Austrian colleagues at the border crossing Reintal - Breclav.
It was also taken at the border last year.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year with the troop, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honour for me to have been selected, said Amálie Budíková, a Girl Scout.
Whereas last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now it is taking place at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing in the car park.
Usually, however, the scouts take the train to Vienna to get it.
Nothing changes in the distribution of the flame in the Czech Republic.
The Scouts traditionally set off with the Bethlehem Light by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday, 18 December, the Scout couriers will take care of the subsequent distribution of the light, travelling on selected express and passenger trains.
From them, local scouts or volunteers will take over the light at the stations and then spread the flame across the Czech Republic, even where the tracks do not lead.
This year, Scouts must also comply with the measures in place to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
It is similar to last year.
We are giving recommendations to both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to wear veils, to try to keep the spacing as low as possible, not to sing to colleagues, just to behave in a way that is as safe as possible, described Zuzana Hrbková, spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light travelling through Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and tranquillity along with the flame.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
Scouts and Girl Scouts have been spreading it in the Czech Republic for more than 30 years.
The event is based on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All the latest news, including a list of places where people can come to pick up a flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economics background, so I don't know the basic economics that confirms that subsidies are a cancer on the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education will make good use of the money, but I just don't understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - it produces a useless product and upsets the free market and the "natural life of the firm".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million "xy funded/co-funded by project xy" signs in the corridors and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not supporting a company that gives jobs to x number of people, this is holding back development when this company is holding on and taking contracts/employees away from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
I totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the internet age also falls for a trick or trap - especially advertising.
I myself think that internet ads don't move me, but then I still find myself being influenced by them - it's just so sophisticated that you can't always resist it.
For this reason, I also support the radical voices in the European Parliament that currently want to put a total ban on programmatic (= targeted) ads...
It's all bullshit, in the words of the classic - I would ban the internets.
I have the feeling that this belief has its roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I won't believe something that the majority believes and makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that is less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion which I will claim is cryptic thinking"
2. "I'm not going to believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Television has fallen for the Christmas movie trend, with two hundred premiering this year
Los Angeles - Cinemas, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have bucked the trend of Christmas movies, and this year will premiere a record-breaking two hundred-plus of them to their audiences.
This was calculated by the operator of the IMDb film database.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring points with the audience in recent years and has significantly increased its viewership, which is why more and more of these films are being made.
Four times more Christmas films were made this year than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database only includes films that have the word Christmas in their title, so there will be many more holiday films in the real world.
The films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are especially associated with this season, but popular worldwide are also films such as Home Alone, Love in Heaven or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946.
But the real boom of Christmas movies started in 2009, when the American cable TV station Hallmark came up with a special series, the BBC recalled.
Her Advent project, Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station started tuning in for Christmas on 22 October and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Rival station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on the schedule this year, with popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contributing to the total.
"At this magical time of year, the story doesn't matter that much, what matters is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, described the genre with exaggeration.
"It's a form of escape for the audience and a way to feel a little bit of peace for at least two hours in the midst of all the holiday madness and craziness of the world we've been living in for the last couple of years," Gray added.
Hallmark Television, for example, uses the same formula for its films, which is uniform but successful, he said.
You have two people who fall in love, but then a misunderstanding arises about half an hour before the end, which is resolved and they kiss.
It's like that over and over again, and as long as all the films look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after another, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19, he will not take part in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will start the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19 and will not take part in the last race of the season.
Haas will only send one car to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better position from the 20th place he had achieved in qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin from Haas will not take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the grid, with Mazeppa's teammate Mick Schumacher starting from last place and Max Verstappen from first, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
According to the Haas stable, Mazepin is relatively well and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the guidelines of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all parties involved," its representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not send a replacement driver to the race, nor can they.
A possible replacement would have to qualify or drive in a different part of the weekend.
Covid-19 is not the first competitor to struggle.
Kimi Räikkönen tested covid-19 at the start of the season, Sergio Pérez or Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.
You could get arrested for that, too.
And everyone won't care that the boss said

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: the price tag of the most expensive sweater stuns!
It's a bit like a portable jewellery store and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never worn much at home," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work over six months.
The silk was bought in Italy, the 24-carat gold threads in France and 2,000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars were then decorated with 150 diamonds.
"The base is wool and cotton, but the silk adds softness to the sweater," praises the creator of his work, which, however, he does not recommend washing.
And there's another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as soon as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater to date, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

The government approves the deployment of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
The engineers, scouts and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to help their Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has formally requested assistance from NATO countries in connection with the months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of an easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating on Polish territory.
Omikron mutation spreading in South Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
"We currently have another suspected variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov Elementary School has not been proven," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the county during the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Institute of Health in Prague," the director said.
She added that the victims were two nurses from one department of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year-old pupils from the Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the Brno and Adamov cases.
According to the director, three of them have mild symptoms and four are asymptomatic.
No one suspected of having Omicron has traveled abroad
None of those mentioned had travelled abroad, nor had any of their families, nor had there been any contact with anyone who had been abroad.
There is no connection to the water polo championship for any of those mentioned, Ciupek said.
Earlier, Chief Hygienist Pavla Svrčinová said the international water polo tournament, which took place in Brno a few weeks ago, was being investigated.
There were also players from South Africa and one Belgian player fell ill after his return.
California will restrict gun sales.
He wants to do like Texas in banning abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain guns in America's most populous state, using a legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial law against abortions performed after detecting the heartbeat of an embryo.
The people would then be entitled to damages in a lawsuit by anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement was in response to Friday's U.S. Supreme Court opinion upholding the Texas abortion ban, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established a right to abortion across the U.S. until about the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the Court was not now deciding on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
In this case, enforcement of the ban was delegated to the public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual legal channels.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) decision by the United States Supreme Court, which allowed Texas' ban on most abortion services to stand and largely endorsed Texas' maneuver to protect its law," California Gov.
"If states can now block review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use that power to protect lives," Newsom continues.
He reportedly instructed his subordinates to work with the state legislature and the attorney general on a measure that would empower members of the public to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
This is a term used to describe homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to seek damages of at least $10,000 (over CZK 220,000) and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, "ghost gun" parts or kits in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," said California Gov.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional in June.
If the state were now to actually reinstate the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in a dissenting opinion to Friday's majority verdict warned against extending the legal mechanism to other US states.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant Texas' abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to proceed with lawsuits against select officials in the southern U.S. state.
Each emergency vaccination has a public testing phase, where the vaccination schedule is gradually figured out and the vaccines themselves are improved based on the results.
For example, studies on the effects of the 4th dose are already pouring out of Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a fivefold increase in antibodies, which has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule over time, it's just too early to tell.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, is expected to come on the market soon, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises to be up to 10 times more effective.

Poland threatens to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting unlawfully if it used its new powers to stop paying money to Poland because of a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed approval of Poland's plan to draw down €36 billion from the EU's fund for the recovery of economies hit by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use the mechanism to withdraw EU subsidies from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU with a veto on all issues that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidary Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, which are leading to drastic increases in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stops its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified given that the EU is illegally denying us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes a more radical stance on the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes the Polish judiciary has undergone under Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is setting "impossible conditions because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw is facing "a political dictatorship carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles", Ziobro also said.
He said Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states, not on the rule of the most powerful and a Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never make concessions to Brussels that would result in a reduction of Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to give Poland the status of a colony," he said.
But figuring it out... At Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, I met one yogurt more than once too, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector were all the selected, less usual and special cheeses, but it was between vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there's an emergency, I won't even go to any more markets, no action, the golden shop on the square, they may not have such a selection, but they usually have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take my holiday.
And I don't care anymore.
I've watched two years of data being treated like manure here, most vaccine opponents are just a little more out of touch than most vaccine advocates.
Rational discussion does take place at a professional level, but only extreme views make their way into the public arena.

Binary thinking: vaccination saves us, vaccination is useless.

Ugh, I'm so relieved.
Sorry for the outburst and have a nice day to you all.
I was punished with a boil when I was a kid.
It was never because of grades, it was usually just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was naughty (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc).
At the same time I was never punished without warning, my mom always threatened first that if I did it again I would get hit (sometimes even after another "catch" she just brought the cooker and put it down so I could see it).
It was only after I repeatedly refused to listen that I got a couple of swats on my bottom (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (when done reasonably and in moderation) is beneficial because the child responds to it much more than to words.
I think the warning part is important, because it gives the child a choice in a way whether to disobey and get punished, or to do better and not get punished.
In the end, I usually just needed a warning to start listening.
System defence
In 1999, when Vojtěch Cepl, a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, answered a journalist's question as to what the Czech constitution means to him - whether it is a sacred document that is sworn to and taught at school, or an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he was definitely inclined to the first concept.
Once we have agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which also define who we are as a country and its citizens, it is better to save the changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just like Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl glossed the question at the time.
Recently, however, the opinion that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs to be amended has become increasingly common among lawyers.
For years it has been tested by situations that its creators (of whom Vojtěch Cepl was one) could not have foreseen, such as the behaviour of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be well thought out.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to dealing with most of the crises that societies throughout history have faced.
A constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of governance consisting of individual rules that set the boundaries of the game for politicians.
We fear that power will be used against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with bans.
But at the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid doesn't choose, in the Brno University Hospital they are fighting for the life of a several-month-old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder towards children, there are also severe cases, which hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are less at risk and less affected than adults, we are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Paediatric Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation at the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, told Novosti.
The course is usually much simpler, lighter and often without symptoms.
But there are pediatric patients who are severely ill with coronavirus, which we have seen especially recently," Dominik said.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
It takes place in the pediatric infectious diseases clinic.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently in the ARU.
Children with postcovid syndromes were in the ward continuously throughout the year, according to the physician.
"There is now an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia that requires a stay in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that the disease affects adolescents as well as babies of several months, in addition to adults.
There are also children in hospitals in serious condition due to coronavirus.
"Currently, we have a child of several months and adolescent age," said the Chief Medical Officer.
However, he is happy that no child deaths from coronavirus have been recorded at the Children's Hospital of the University Hospital Brno so far.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 years died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, in a children's hospital - not only in the coronary care unit - the collaboration of a psychologist is an integral part.
It also highlights the fact that, as in adults, vaccination in children also reduces the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
"That's why we also recommend the vaccine dose for children," the doctor added.
You can only walk on designated paths in the quiet zone.
But the quiet zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
Generally in national parks outside the rest area you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the game preserve).
You can't ski/bike in the woods outside of marked trails anywhere unless you have an exemption (but of course it's not policed that much outside of national parks).
How does the conductor practice?
The music is in my head, laughs Josef Kurfiřt.
He is addicted to the Liberec opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer he can sing practically all repertoire and as a conductor he works not only in the F. Šalda Theatre in Liberec, but also in Pilsen, at the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
He collaborates with the Hradecky Philharmonic Orchestra, the Film Philharmonic Orchestra and the Podkrkonoše Symphony Orchestra.
China gives the impression that the contagion has been contained and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Sinologist Jiroush: China is giving the impression that the contagion is contained and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has gone on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing fended off criticism for failing to stop a disease that has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero infections.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against coronavirus in many places, for example in the worst affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him: hey, do you want an elephant?
I got it and it's awesome.
My wife likes it because she mows the grass, washes the car with the trunk, the kids play with it.
Oh, just great.
I'll sell you an elephant for 5000,-
Friend: all right, let's high five, that'll be great...
After a while they meet and the one who bought it complains: dude, what kind of elephant did you sell it for????
The lawn's trashed, there's giant shit everywhere, he's trashed the car, the kids are scared of him and his wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold it says: you talk bad about the elephant, you can't sell an elephant like that...
World events are dominated by the great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can only become such a power if it works on its integration.
So far, it is working at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is heading towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe by mid-century the mood will be different and it will work.
I thought of that too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm being wordy.
I'm just assuming that an ellipse usually involves 2 different units at the same level.
To borrow an example from another comment, "Spanish oranges and tangerines" makes it clear that both are from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and tangerines" it is no longer clear that the tangerines are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces" including their weapons and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
So, in other words, I expect it's already covered in that broad term and there's no need to further specify it for U.S. forces.
But again, maybe I'm just being wordy :D
Either way, it's a nonsensical demand

Vicki Holland from the UK tortured Milly the Cosmos Monkey
Horrifying footage shows the moment the terrified monkey cowered in the toilet bowl before its callous owner flushed it down the toilet and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrates Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
The monkey rehabilitation experts who are caring for Milly after her abuse said they had never seen such a terrified cosmos.
Milly spent almost two years rehabilitating with Monkey World staff in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The mother-of-four pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was given a 12-week prison sentence suspended for one year at Gwent Magistrates' Court.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, banned from keeping animals for life and ordered to pay CZK 12 000 in court costs.
Steph Sawyer, the Small Monkeys team leader who rehabilitated the abused animal, said, "Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she's settled and happy with the male, the sight of new people can still cause her to panic.
The psychological scars of the abuse will always be with her, Sawyer said.
Milly's abuse came to light after police in Gwent discovered horrifying footage on the woman's phone following a raid on her flat on drug charges.
In the footage, Milly can be heard cursing vulgarly.
In another video, Holland is heard offering cocaine to a monkey and saying, "You want some cocaine?"
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to sell.
Cocaine worth £1,600 (less than 50,000 crowns) was found hidden in Kinder eggs in her house.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts do you learn from that prehistory three times in a row when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like, you're gonna take the same stuff freshman year that you took in sixth grade?
And the whole thing is killed by the idea of bullshit, where nobody, with honourable exceptions, cares if you can or understand it.
As long as you get a 1 on the test, and then nobody cares.
Go and ask random people on the street if they can determine the nature of the roots of a quadratic equation and the coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the absolute majority won't even bite the bullet and tell you they're totally fucked.
Then what the fuck are they learning?
I'm a big fan of the general overview and the reality is that people don't want to and don't have the need.
And at that point it's pointless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Part of it is learning for the many people who will need that thing.
But, like, the comment that you don't really need all that to stand by the machine, I was totally serious... ...because you just don't.
Plus, we're slowly getting to a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(Our communist past and the incitement against the educated and the elite probably play a part in this) But the price of having barbarians standing by our machines is simply high.
If journalists could count, the covid here would probably never have reached these proportions.

Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right away," Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to the probing questions of curious fans about what disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social media.
Things had been creaking between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move in with her, at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she flatly refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! Kadri reacted angrily to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
Kadri's now ex-wife's alleged honesty did not sit well with his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly stand up for her brother.
Normally I don't comment on such things at all, and even in my family we never really talked about these things.
I certainly don't want to invoke any pity.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, I just can't let it go!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character of himself and helping our family when we needed it most, despite how young he was.
It makes me all the more sorry to have to read such false information that is probably quite out of context.
I would dearly like everyone to know Kadri as I do, our loved ones and family, the confession reads in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him more than anything and we know the reality and we know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunken thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what it's about.
Cao began his heist in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole less than CZK 330 from one vehicle.
Then he thought of nothing better than to climb to the fifth floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
One security camera shows him walking down the street away from the crime scene, eating a banana as he does so.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
She subsequently detained Cao.
The man admitted to having consumed some alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob while drunk.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed up the facade to the 5th floor where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Act is time-limited and tied in effect to a pandemic alert.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.
Although the law limits the scope of business
Isn't that reason enough for you?
The right to assemble will be restricted but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters turned out to vote in Saturday's elections for the four municipal councils
On Saturday people voted for new councils in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected councils have broken up.
A total of 99 candidates contested the 28 seats on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected councillors is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a rather difficult but successful year for us.
A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils took place in the Czech Republic, as well as the much-watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said Eva Krumpová, deputy chair of the Czech Statistical Office.
She recalled that the covid-19 epidemic made the election more challenging in terms of equipment and staffing.
The Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's elections in Komno in the Uherské Hradiště region, winning 27.76 % of the vote and two seats on the seven-member town council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 % of the vote, which also means she won two seats.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats on the council, with 18.52 % of voters casting their ballots.
The current mayor of the municipality, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Privateers, was also elected to the council again.
Komňany - independent candidates won one seat on the council.
75.48 % of eligible voters went to the polls.
The Pro Rovná association won in the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four seats out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were elected to the municipal council.
Turnout was 93.62 percent.
The Lužice and Svinčice Association, led by Mayor Jindřich John, won the repeat election in Lužice in the Most region.
It won 56.73 % of the vote and, as in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member council.
The Municipality for the People candidate came in second, with 43.27 % of voters casting their ballots and will have three representatives on the town council.
76.7 % of voters turned out to the polls.
The independent candidates of Hope for Nová Ves won the elections in Nová Ves before the ANO Movement.
59.88 % of the voters voted for the association of independent candidates and thus won four seats on the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 % of the vote and strengthened its position compared to the regular elections in 2018, gaining one more seat and having three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
The State Election Commission will discuss the election results on Monday.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be the bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people are writing to you.
You're just playing dumb to have someone to "argue" with.
If not, that's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of the church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal, to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raked in, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it's caused, like the 30-year
Tl;dr: believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell headlong from 12 metres.
He survived the impact with the concrete.
A man in Ostrava survived an unbelievable fall on Sunday night and was treated by rescuers from the regional ambulance service.
Workers at the regional operations centre received an emergency call an hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two ambulance crews - medical and paramedics - immediately went to the scene.
On arrival at the scene, paramedics found that the 27-year-old man had fallen from a window from a height of around 12 metres and landed head first on the concrete!
Coal caught in Vítkovice.
But not as it should have been, and the fire department went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the ambulance teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate danger of death.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after further measures within the framework of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to the Ostrava trauma centre for further care, informed the spokesman of the MS Region's Emergency Medical Services, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more concerned than about the coronavirus about the inadequate response of the public and the authorities
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but the front line in the fight against the disease is mainly doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask military doctor David Rezac.

Legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends belt
MMA had a great gala evening full of interesting results.
Things were happening at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peña managed to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who hadn't found an opponent in seven years.
Lightweight Charles Oliveira didn't falter, putting on a great choke against Dustin Poirier to defend his belt.
Kai Kara-France also scored a win, quickly sweeping Cody Garbrandt with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise no one expected.
That's what the women's bantamweight bout between the renowned Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña brought.
The American entered the mutual battle as an imaginary "dwarf", as Nunes had not lost in seven years and was grinding her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her journey to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick that sent her to the ground.
However, Peña was not going to be forced to make any more mistakes and tried unsuccessfully to attack with an arm bar herself.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents peppered each other with plenty of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, Peña got Nunes on the ground, where she began to choke her.
She had to give up the effort and knock the attack off.
The American gave everyone a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the lightweight title fight between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier.
Poirier fared better at first, but the tables gradually began to turn.
In the second one, Oliveira tried to be more active and tried to hit his opponent with an arm bar.
He was not very successful, but then he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and hit him with a series of shots.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to tap out.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next fight, Sean O'Malley scored an emphatic triumph by landing a hard right hand on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
He then finished him off with a series of accurately aimed blows to record his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was then able to handle Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her young daughter, now after seven years she lost.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so it is not a problem to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or neuter.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns whose gender is not stable.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When inflected, they then take on double endings and in some cases remain in the non-close form.
For example, the words "svízel" or "hip" are both masculine and feminine, the former inflected according to the pattern "machine", the latter according to the pattern "song".
Another group of nouns has different forms in the first case of the singular, e.g. "row/row", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "potato/brambora" (meaning food).
Both forms are spelled the same way, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is ungrammatical, as are other Czech-Moravian word pairs: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih", etc.
Some words that have entered Czech from other languages were originally non-cloning, but gradually they have adopted Czech endings.
A typical example is the term "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "bufet", which remains unclothed in the middle gender but has masculine endings like "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to enter Europe.
What is the situation on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border because of the increasing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to make their way to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped obstructing them.
European politicians are promising support to Greece, and the Czech government is also planning humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to make the uncertain journey?
And what is the situation on the ground?
We didn't see blue skies for three months and we were suffocating, says Sydney journalist
The devastating wildfires, now in their fourth month, have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and ravaged millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the residents themselves coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic consequences that critics claim?
And what will the country need to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with Ika Detrichová, a journalist from Sydney.
False accusations have always been and are pretty rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It's uncomfortable for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to lock it away.
I don't personally know anyone who's been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I have seen how those people are often treated by their neighborhood or even by the police.
A victim should always be trusted.
It has become a trend for victims to finally open up about their traumas.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who will make false accusations.
It's disgusting and spit in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "much of the accusations are fabricated" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sexual abusers.
Czech Republic is flooded with unfinished houses, families have no money to finish them
Building material prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
This has put many people in a difficult situation.
She does not have the funds to complete her unfinished houses and the banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction work is also increasing.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to finish the already completed houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely uncomfortable situations.
At best, people are moving into unfinished and uncompleted houses.
In the worst case, the houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay the mortgage and pay the rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three single-family homes a year, and fifty percent of the time we do.
For us as a construction company it is difficult in that we have to keep some things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
So we work without earnings," said Zdeněk Slivoň, the owner of the construction company.
A lot of people are yet to have financial problems.
If they were counting on the house costing them five million to build, now it's going to cost them seven.
I think some will wait," Slivoň said.
Of the materials, copper, iron and plumbing and heating equipment rose the most.
But construction firms are also struggling with labour shortages.
There is a shortage of construction graduates in the Czech Republic and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by the pandemic.
Only the situation regarding the issuance of building permits is more favourable at the moment.
"The building authorities issued 7 675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček said.
We're doing well and we're going to do even better.
But real vision is missing, says commentator of ČRO - mujRozhlas
In addition to the traditional celebrations, the New Year was traditionally accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and Chairman of ANO Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also spoke to the nation.
What did we learn?
Like that's where I find the thesis great, I have my own topic that I've chosen, I build on my bachelor's thesis, I always work on it for a whole year and then in a week or two I write the written part.
The internship is completely fine here, unless a person is a total macaque and has something left in his head, so the committee will not unnecessarily suffocate him on theory.
For example, I studied for a week for the state exam and when I was stumped, the committee always tried to guide me to some logical derivation that I got right and I got it right.
Other than that, I know people who pay someone to do their semester project (we've done it many times, really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
I think it's great when there is an exam at the end of the course that reflects the knowledge gained in the project, not just a defence.
All ok but don't flood the emails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be as much of a dick as they are.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were up against Russia, they would be taking a lot of risks, so maybe they have to play with them, otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can put a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe even put it in a way that he's groping Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, despite Insta throwing sticks at artists.
As soon as you don't post stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach is reduced to an absolute minimum.
Moreover, they keep changing what function is more important, whether to like, comment or save.
It's been pissing me off so much lately, so I may have to stoop to a tick-tock where a lot of artists in my industry have success and barely let on.
In the end, I might even be happy if something more user-friendly came along that didn't suck all the creativity and energy out of the artists
Statement of the Workers' Party of Donbas
Union - yes, break-up - no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal dismantling of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind took place.
In the Belovezhskaya Forest on 8 December 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal powers and in violation of the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with the open condescension of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard for the people, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
With the stroke of a pen, they "abolished" a huge country with a population of nearly three hundred million.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia's population has declined by ten to eleven million.
Even ignoring the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years in one sitting in the White Forest betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They have deliberately deindustrialised, put the brakes on agriculture, cut off from the world's biggest power fourteen republics that had previously been economically united into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the break-up of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all of this is the result of geopolitical surrender, the surrender first of the socialist camp and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as a "power vacuum".
Everything that was betrayed and surrendered in haste was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken today, mainly because of the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a high turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'm going to buy it with the intention of putting it in the fridge and making it for dinner on Thursday.
In an alternate reality, where I don't buy the meat on Monday, on Tuesday the chain discounts it to 99 CZK / kg - describe to me the mechanism by which the change in the price of the meat becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or do I wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the expiry date - how would this meat differ from the one I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer for myself - nothing.
This bullshit about if something is cheap it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or of poor quality is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Now recently I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies were handing out some brochure, I always take stuff like that to help temporary workers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but nothing about God, I was confused, but I suspected it would be some kind of agitprop.
After reading it, I found out who was publishing it, and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, it was good stuff, full of completely unnecessary lessons, like how to wash and not be a pussy.
Too bad about the paper, the forests wouldn't have to be cut down for this.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Mental manipulation and emotional blackmail will make you comply with the person because you like them without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she would cry and beg me on her knees not to go.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months went by and she went nuts.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her I was breaking up and insisting that we could talk about it again next week to calm her down and to keep her from going crazy again.
Such a person will suck the feelings, emotions and overall joy out of you.
Better keep your distance
When insurance companies are being rampantly ripped off by buying a cloud of tests and chasing down positives who wouldn't even know about the horrible disease if it weren't for the test.
All we are accomplishing is complicating things for businesses, carriers and others, because of the fact that their employees in the random number generator have been placed under five days of house arrest.
In the West, they have already stopped the shenanigans and recognized that there is no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and he still has to steal something and fuel his ego by inventing faggotry.
I see we're getting some good old-fashioned crap again.
After several years of decline and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruitment is back in the limelight.
I was one of the recruiters, I gave it a try (I was 20 years old, a freshman in college), the initial promises of product and business skills training quickly turned into "you don't have to care, just get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I was offering as I wanted to help people, however the training was more about how to scare and talk people down.
When the first money came in, you quickly realized that if you wanted to make money, you had to pick up a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, which made one feel like a door-to-door pot dealer.
But what can I say, it was a valuable experience, you learn that you should not jump on every tip and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump everyone together.
There are people in this business who are successful and even helpful to people, but they certainly won't be bragging about expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
I haven't seen much of that in the corporate world where I work.
HR is calm, the managers are minding their own business and not sticking their noses in our business.
So regular evaluation is happening somehow, in the form it's going on here it's quite good (set some goals for the next year, in a year we'll see what worked and what didn't) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone evaluating you by some numbers, etc.
Company events are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you get the feeling that we're some kind of almost-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works so they don't bother us too much as long as there are results.
A Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
British police have been searching for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November for almost ten days without success.
On Sunday, 12 December, Czech Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that a woman from Uherské Hradiště had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that they have found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
In respect of the family, we will not give any more information about the case.
My condolences, Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on 28 November on a bus on her way home from work, before she was supposed to withdraw money from an ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by her work colleagues five days later.
Subsequently, London police began searching for her, and Interpol listed her as missing worldwide.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police have already arrested a man in this connection several days ago.
She did not disclose what role he was supposed to have played in the case or what she suspects him of.
In four municipalities, new councils were endowed at the end of the year
On Saturday, 11 December, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected councils have broken up.
There were 99 valid candidates running for 28 seats in the new elections.
The turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rovná, where 93.62 % of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won seats.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
A total of 13 lists of candidates have been registered for the new elections to the local councils in the four municipalities.
Thirty-six women and 63 men ran for 28 seats.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a rather difficult but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the much-watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place.
We had to work mostly in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and staffing, assessed Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last polling station was processed at 03:49 on Sunday 12 December.
The results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission on Monday and, once approved, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a quite dangerous contagious disease at the very beginning, but it went without much hitch.
Coming to terms with the idiotic attitude of a large portion of the population at all levels of the population, I still have a problem with that.
I'm most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because it will finally make me less dependent on other people not being assholes.
He would be stripped of his presidency and his eligibility to regain it.
But the chances of that actually happening are, as others here mention, very slim.
Moreover, I'm not sure if the mapping of the file could be considered treason at all.
Treason is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the State.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: the number of people under 35 who go without sex for a year is growing
More and more young adults in the US are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who are sex-abandoners rose from eight to 21 per cent.
There are more women aged between 18 and 35 who say they have not had sex in the last year than ever before.
Other factors are also contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and higher unemployment rates.
But the presence of media, social networks and video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, may also have contributed.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who report not having had sex in the previous year has been rising rapidly," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Married people are more likely to be sexually active, with only 5% reporting that they had gone without sex in the last year in 2021.
For single people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious beliefs also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under 35 is still declining.
Young people are divided in their opinion of premarital sex, with about 30% considering it a bad thing, while about 70% think it is okay.
"It's true that they are a minority among single individuals in this age group, but their behavior is shifting that trend," Stone says of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, the abstinence rate for single people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20 to almost 60%.
Among the 'less religious', the trend has risen from 10 to 20%," Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that people without jobs or with lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, "replacing" this need.
This trend caught on especially during the lockdown of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole point of mandating covid vaccination is about whether society should force a segment of the population to engage in a behavior that they don't want, but that could save their lives.
It's a rather difficult question, and the one I'm personally most interested in is the question of social conscience.
I.e., for example, the question of whether if we don't order it and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly blame the death of an 80-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated and ended up catching it and dying.
On the other hand, I don't think we are to blame for the death of a die-hard opponent of vaccination, who is shouting something about bullying and a totalitarian state alongside the SPD and the Communist Party.
From the statistics I mentioned, it is quite clear that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they will really be to blame.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will the mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter has so far brought one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic in recent times.
The operators of ski resorts cannot do without technical snow, the weather also complicates the preparation of the cross-country skiing Jizera Fifty.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it's not about a porker.
Once in high school, our teacher took us across town to the boathouse so we could ride boats on the river.
On the way there we walked down a fairly wide street and who do we see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they came down on us.
Luckily, I ran away, but she and a friend got into a fight.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're so spoiled.
Not so much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovic
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels, the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was greeted with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in our relations," Morawiecki told a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must make it clear together that it will not accept a violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis, triggered by the alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normandy Group", which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he had informed the Chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukashenko, has artificially created a migration crisis and is using people as live targets and weapons, as night after night we see hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin would finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to DPA, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by the Lukashenko regime.
Drunk Polish nun caused accident, tried to hide it
The car returned to the scene after a while, but another nun was driving the car and tried to take the blame.
When police told her that she could still lose her licence for failing to yield the right of way and driving away from the scene of the accident, she came clean, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that the vehicle was hit by another nun who asked her for help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
They gave her a breathalyzer test and after they found she had over two milligrams of alcohol in her blood, they immediately revoked her driver's license.
At the same time, they told her that she would confess to her actions in court.
Hugo the dog is doing the best he can.
But Juraj Šajmovič did not protect his film.
Czech creators of family comedies looked at American stories about pet dogs.
But in doing so, they have forgotten the essential thing: the laws of film craft.
After F. Brabec's kitsch film Gump - The Dog Who Taught People How to Live, another film is now competing for the audience's emotions in the cinemas.
The co-writer and director Juraj Šajmovič Jr. is loosely based on his previous film I'm Watching Here from 2012.
Hugo the talking dachshund and some familiar characters return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a boarding house in the Sumava Mountains, which is failing, so they start inviting dog walkers, Julie's father and his partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) had already struggled with the narrative techniques in their previous dog film, but there at least the children and the dog had fun.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of amazement and embarrassment.
Let's recap.
Julie, though a scientist, succumbs to the darker delusions in her desire for a child and, if the right "constellation" comes along, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan wherever the coordinates are set - on the hood of a car or a church tower (during an ongoing excursion with a local guide, of course), Mojmír, a retired colonel, despite his years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the woods, who falls into a coma, whereupon she is taken by her family to the hospital so that a miraculous healing process can take place in the heart of the Sumava solitude with a dog.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer is amazed, however, at the content of the pelmelo full of unbelievable situations and figures that was needed for this message.
A couple of female thieves from the staff, a dog-owning contest, a Sumava charlatan, policemen coming to look for "drugs" and discussing over herbs the fertilizing power of bone meal - and which the drunken family in the guesthouse gets drunk on, of course.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma and sits at the family table with a cigarette and make-up on, demanding her father's whiskey and flakka as a cured vegetarian, it is impossible not to laugh.
On top of that, the filmmakers explain to the viewer that "sometimes this happens after a coma".
Šajmovič's team lacks the basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build supporting situations, a sense of character and punchline, and directorial direction.
The acting is uneven, the editing clueless and the overall impression muddy.
As much as Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to hold their own, they don't have much to play for.
The only positive point of the film remains the poetic shots of Šumava nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to outline a few characters, a flimsy plot and doggerel, let alone the more folksy vulgar expressions the characters commit.
The argument is not even a long-standing membership in the Dachshund Breeders Club - as in the case of the producer.
Behind the good intentions to promote nature and human-dog friendship, there must be a knowledge of the craft if one wants to tell a believable story.
That failed in this case.
For a good family film, there's a bit too much eroticism and minimal sense of genre.
Even as an advertisement for canister therapy, this amateurishly conceived piece wouldn't pass muster.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to the constant abuse from morons just like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, it shows here how you don't understand shit, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if they don't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to these kids all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in this case a part-time job for extra income.
The Middle East has been plagued by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term average rainfall for November.
This week's two-day rain was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here in a long time.
It is also the right Christmas setting, rejoiced Nazareth resident Wasim Ashkar.
Precipitation in Israel occurs almost exclusively in the winter months, and is sporadic and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It's not just forests, but also drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater resource in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been dropping.
Water managers have been warning of drought for a long time.
"It is to be expected that depending on global warming and climate change, there may be less rainfall," predicted Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for the Israel Water Authority, in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
There are more and more tankers on the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders are up seventy to eighty percent compared to the previous two years," tanker driver Imad Suleiman reported in September.
Clashes erupt between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The local riverbed was completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel prepares military intervention against Iran
Israel's defence minister said the talks in Vienna had produced "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said Saturday that he has ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis reports.
Gantz, who is staying in the US, is trying to persuade the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but has also briefed Washington on military preparations.
During a news conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear talks in Vienna had produced "no progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing them."
About 3 years ago this happened to me too.
I liked the lady a bit and grilled her during the conversation to find out what she actually wanted from me.
Eventually I found out that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I kept pestering the lady with doubts and questions for a while and finally thanked her and left.
Call me a punk, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers hit the mountains this weekend, with plenty of snow and good weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced their first major influx of people interested in skiing this weekend.
After the heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started their operations.
Skiers were not discouraged by the obligation to show a covid certificate at the lifts.
While lift operators are not complaining about the lack of customer interest, some ski equipment rental companies are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region hit the cross-country trails and slopes this weekend.
The skiers were favoured by the weather, which today offered sun and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really worked out from the Friday night skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," said Jakub Hanuš, director of the Ještěd Sports Complex.
Hundreds of people went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branna in the Šumperk region were open.
Weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, said Rostislav Procházka, the representative of the ski resort in Branná.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who have been vaccinated or are within the period after contracting covid-19.
With a few exceptions, people are prepared for this and present the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski centre told the Czech Press Agency.
"We have recorded only units of incidents," he added.
Some ski equipment rental and sales shops are reporting lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava shop in Opava.
He expects more traffic during the ski course season.
David Šinták, the managing director of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear, also feels that due to the covid there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time, before the pandemic, we were almost on borrowed time.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
He said people have become lazy with the pandemic and have learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, the rental shop in the Novako area in Boží Dar is in great demand.
They started renting skis a week ago and those interested in renting skis must order them in advance.
"We start renting cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the ski area.
She also said there is comparable interest in the ski school to the period before the epidemic.
If we want the successful and rich not to go abroad, they must be able to live a quality life here as they do abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often impossible to find a dentist or specialist doctor.
Smart and skilled people who have no assets here are going abroad.
The owner of the company really doesn't just go abroad.
But I totally agree with the rest.
If these people do not have a good life in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will simply not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary started when Orbán won one day, ruled for a year and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next question is the elections in general.
If it's going to be a bad life here, some traditional V4k lunatic might as well win.
The young and the educated will leave, his supporters and people whose property cannot be put on a plane will stay.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in blood over a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film The Island, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), was enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is this a real injury, or is it makeup for the shoot?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behaviour and we are becoming very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncova worked, said in a video released Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to the missing Czech woman, she left work on Sunday 28 November at around 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on 3 December by one of her co-workers.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nurses' assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petra who is missing," the healthcare group said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Czech MP Harriet Harman is also calling on the public to cooperate, as she drew attention to Srncová's case during a press conference on Saturday.
"She's been missing for several days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death," the Labour politician said, holding up a photograph of the woman distributed by London police.
"I feel like we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family, and she worked here for our health care system," Harman said.
Police have previously arrested a man in connection with the case, but he remains in custody.
However, according to the BBC news website, police have not provided any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of doing.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine that way either.
These are not "huge numbers", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine keeps saying that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is getting fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know what makes you think Russia wants war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison to the situation in '38 is off on so many points I don't even know where to begin.
I can already compare this to the first Punic war and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I imagine that after Ukraine announced that it was not going to abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia will annex those ridiculous republics.
That's about it, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would correspond to.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, they will mainly affect suburban connections
Passengers on Prague's integrated transport (PID) will have to face several changes from Sunday, especially concerning suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed their routes, and others disappeared.
The Mladá Boleslav region is newly included in the integrated system.
In the capital, fast trains from České Budějovice stop at the Zahradní Město station from Sunday.
In suburban train transport, the S7 trains will run on the route from Beroun to Český Brod through Prague Central Station.
The R17 fast train from České Budějovice and Benešov will now stop at the recently opened Prague-Zahradní Město station.
The PID will now be extended to other areas.
Among others, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladá Boleslav region will be included, including lines with an overlap to the Liberec and Hradec Kralove regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 existing lines will be modified.
A new bus line 405 will start from Prague's Zličín and will go all the way to Žatec.
There is also a new direct connection Prague - Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
Connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and at the weekend, when the express line number 404 will be newly available.
Lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec Region are now included in the PID system.
They depart from the metro station Střížkov, not from the station Nádraží Holešovice.
Backbone line 400 runs via Mělník, Dubá and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The additional line 410 runs via Mělník and Dubá to Doksy, Mimon and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the other hand, the operation on ten local lines in Central Bohemia, among others to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmital pod Třemšínem, has been cancelled or restricted.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernisation of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes are also awaiting passengers at other locations.
Buses are replacing some cancelled railway lines or the section on line 420 from Dobříš with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymburk region have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch for the office from the supermarket
Hi, I do the classic 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option for food is to go next door to Billy's or a little further down the road to Lidl.
Since I don't have any exercise, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I buy at most a pizza bun and a yoghurt and an apple for a snack.
Question: what healthy, no-cook foods would you recommend I buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a metre of snow like you do, unfortunately that's the way it is.
And it's not about trees that you necessarily have to see.
Only the tip of the tree can be hidden under the snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're banned from off-piste, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedved: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech show business pond has been alive with nothing but the revelation of Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedved's relationship.
They have been going at it since the summer, the famous footballer even got a divorce because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to her fans explaining why she kept her love a secret from them for six months.
"I dare say that there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would miss the fact that Dara has caught a bear, sorry, Nedved," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
He said he picked her up, not the other way around.
For three days they are the centre of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
Something we both weren't looking forward to, but knew would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether those who don't care at all and it jumps out of the can at them, or we, whose lives they dissect in detail.
It's as if one of you wanted an opinion on whether you and your spouse or girlfriend are good enough for each other, or you insisted that everyone should know the list of your former partners in detail and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and errors.
That's what you want, that's what you want, it bothers Dara.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rolins was travelling to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedved has been there for a long time as vice-president of Juventus Football Club.
They only came out with the truth now because they were waiting for the Nedved divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but have only been married for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, thank you.
We are only human too, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband, and just as he stands by me, I stand by him. For better or for worse, Rolins concluded.
Hi, the other commenters have probably already said all the essentials, I'm just confirming that dorms are great to start with, my classmates usually met and made friends within the first semester or two and then found sublets together, which seems like the best option to me because you know who you'll be living with.
Apartments are usually not advertised very far in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it certainly doesn't hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), even some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student-oriented, Královo pole, and it's fine in that direction, besides it's close to most of the faculties of the BUT (I don't know where exactly you're going).
I've never rented, but I'm a native Brnoer, so I can possibly advise you about Brno as such, if you still lack some information :)
What an example of completely "normal" thinking to me.
Because of what a few doctors somewhere in Poland have decided to do, it is actually quite all right that the state does not fund some schools sufficiently.
Either let them teach what they want and pay for it out of their own pocket, or let them go by the state and the state will pay for it.
We cannot let a private actor take over a piece of education just because he throws a few crowns on top of the full state contribution and thanks to that he can teach whatever he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier made such a statement about a petition drive to boycott the totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone having an abortion is the same to you as a vote against a statue in the town square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I've experienced when cataloguing/digitizing that (even long-time professionals) either throw it away by eye or write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and note that it is illegible.
The truth is that in this case it's quite legible, so I probably wouldn't recommend it entirely.
Personally, I'd probably deal with it in a note of some sort depending on what program you're using.
If you wanted to be a proper and diligent student, you could look in some character databases and find the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created their own character to match what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it the Odryan Empire (kingdom) rather than the Odryan one?
PSS: someone already broke it to you.
Check out the comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the "theme" of our Presidency will be.
That's a much worse problem than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is laughable.
All important documents are examined word for word, some basic knowledge of English is not enough for that anyway, that is a matter for lawyers.
There are hundreds of translators and interpreters working in various EU institutions, and English is more suited to politicians for informal contacts and establishing above-standard relations.
Plus, the English language thing is quite interesting, after GB's exit from the EU.
I don't understand the hate on Ceylon.
It's my third year working there and I'm totally fine.
How many times I drive from work I at 10 pm and never any problem.
Only someone who has hardly set foot in the ghetto can say it's a ghetto.
Yes, most of Brno's Roma population lives there, but all they do is get in the way on the sidewalk and park where they shouldn't :D It's definitely not that I'm afraid to go out on the street in the evening.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to downtown, I'd go for it.
Many of the apartments there are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his lover Gelemová as a stake in the fence!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, but not Felix Slováček.
I don't have an advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I have seen Dada's wreath and Lucie certainly has one too, the saxophonist told Blesk, confirming Patrasová's words that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda stayed alone after his departure.
Slováček still doesn't know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met up with Annika, Felix and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER!
But we were still talking, so Christmas didn't come up.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts all the time and I will definitely buy something for Dada and Lucia, probably a perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the launch of the music video at the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slováček, who was happy to meet Luděk Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And we are Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that would be a bad argument, so explain that to me?
I know of no other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
Police officers are few and can't afford it, so can firefighters, and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of medically trained people at that level.
And the fact that our army is only able to defend Ostrava goes to the head of previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for long enough.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
Agricultural subsidies need to be changed, the countryside should not just be a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through its worst drought in years.
According to scientists, water has become scarcer in mountain and foothill areas, and less precipitation has been recorded in places where there has been no shortage of water.
Climate change is the cause of the drought that is affecting much of central Europe.
But the impact is compounded by the way we manage the land.
What to prepare for in the context of the drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah that's right, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I don't know what hockey is and the tactics (that I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are a total mess too.
And whether you are hockey team "bear Russia" or "lama China" losing by two goals even if you don't have to win the game at any cost is different than when it is tied.
But anyway, listening to the Czech commentators, what they point out, what the referees don't notice, whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's the way it is with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it was the other way around it's like it always is, and the Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than it has won, I guess it would be the classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: number of infections in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the country, with 74 more.
The number of confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic is 1967 per 100 000, 871 per 100 000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It is the lowest daily count since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10 016 896.
The daily death toll is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since late October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" major wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for the UK's Health and Safety Executive, said on television on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalised in Britain and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
British Labour chief Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson had apparently broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister in Johnson's government defended that the quiz was conducted "virtually", via computer.
However, it was attended by groups of staff gathered around computers in Downing Street.
Pressure is mounting in Britain to remove Johnson from the premiership.
Last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers threw numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government have made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV's UK commercial television: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won the general election by a landslide.
This morning the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him as Prime Minister.
It is remarkable how quickly events unfolded.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary faces elections in the spring that could end Viktor Orbán's 12-year rule.
This will be an election of pan-European significance.
How fair can they be expected to be?
They won't be fair.
They will probably not be free either, because the last two elections under Orbán were not either.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of constituencies to benefit from this, and does other smaller or bigger tricks.
The last one so far is that everyone can vote where they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to bring voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So just to reiterate, they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is significantly different.
It used to be about not whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that a united opposition will win more votes and seats.
This is very unusual for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even harder in an effort to retain power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are prepared to go beyond what they have been doing.
Recently, a recording of László Kövér, speaker of parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, leaked to the independent media, where he tells the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of the new approach you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of the new things.
It all starts with the tongue.
I've been hit quite often, last time I was 14, my mom's parents don't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has for a long time but then he hits her extremely hard (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I was very angry as a child, to the point that I was lying on the floor in convulsions and I was all blue, I was taken to the shower about twice to calm down.
Sometimes they slapped me educationally, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence now, when I was a kid I used to fight quite a bit, now I at least hit something to get it out, and when I was younger I used to slap my parents on the arm (to avoid getting hit too hard), so never anything extreme, but I always have that urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my explosiveness, but I'm sure my upbringing has something to do with it too.
I'm afraid I'll lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that hitting kids is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at that moment when it wasn't "educational" anymore, but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just fucked something up, I guess it's impossible not to fuck up your kids at least a little bit, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't offend me in any way, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call those who make laws of this quality cunts.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not worried about a loss of income?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying the product and you having the money to pay the mortgage?
Kocner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the killers of journalist Kuciak?
The main trial of the four accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins in Slovakia.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It stirred civil society, but it also exposed the practices of accused businessman Marian Kočner and his connections to the top levels of Slovak politics and justice.
How crucial a breakthrough will the process be for Slovakia?
The journalists are hugely to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition got orders of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all the medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?
No, they got fooled and society bounced back.

Another government ends and the law on municipal involvement in the selection of repositories is nowhere to be found
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs a major overhaul
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over and the law that was supposed to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens were respected in the selection and permitting of a deep repository for highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government suspended the discussion of the proposal submitted to the Government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against Deep-Sea Storage, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Local governments are expecting the law to significantly strengthen their options in deciding on the repository, as has been promised to mayors since 2011, when work on this legislation first began, and as required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect the new government to rework the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The draft law by Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, is criticized by municipalities in particular: the proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of a repository site is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will proceed at all in a given location.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Repository Authority to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before initiating a specific procedure.
The submitted draft of the substantive plan almost completely neglects public participation and makes municipal citizens practically mere extras in permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a systemic setup of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a site for a repository, its permitting and operation.
Under today's legal standards, municipal representatives realistically have little ability to advocate for the interests of their citizens in the search for a repository site.
Only in certain permit procedures can they comment or appeal, but the authority or minister whose interest is served by the permit is the one that decides.
Any action shall have no suspensive effect on the carrying out of exploration or construction work.
The co-determination of local governments that the Platform calls for is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those that have already made progress in permitting repositories, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and which is a follow-up to the contracts with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total amount for these works is almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, vice-mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesman for the Platform against Deep-Sea Storage, said: After the ministers of industry, who only postponed the settlement of the position of local governments in relation to state authorities in the search for a deep repository for highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turn from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We would also like to thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for its support, which perceives the issue of insufficient municipal rights in such a crucial construction in a similar way as the municipalities directly affected in the selected localities.
The Platform Against Deep-Sea Repositories brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) to advocate for a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which is not limited to deep-sea repositories.
The Platform also advocates that the decision on the selection of a site for possible disposal should be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually scared off by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it worked.
Goodman has gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He showed off his new character at the Los Angeles premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body was causing furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
I wanted to take it slow this time.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to the age where I can't afford to sit still anymore, Goodman, whose transformation is amazing, told ABC.
It also depends on what kind of boss and what you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it's some text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming background, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text, perhaps a college text, I would probably look for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There are more than one kind of boss.
Like, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, so the "boss" is like the lord/ruler of the level, and then there's a final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) that don't need to be defeated at all to complete the game or level, but are often even more powerful than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses but the player doesn't directly run into them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called that?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It's probably not possible to translate the boss in a one-word way, Czech and other languages don't solve it (interestingly, only Catalan translates the boss as the final opponent).
In short, it's an important to the story or the game in general, computer-controlled, an adversary more powerful than all the previous ones and guarding the completion of a level or quest.
The whole world is searching for missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncova since 3 December.
The Czech police also joined the search.
She has been looking for a 32-year-old woman from the Uherské Hradiště region since 7 December.
Through Interpol, he also assists the British police.
Czech Petra Srncova was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since 3 December.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular about it.
So the whole world is looking for Petra.
"Czech police are cooperating closely with British police," police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová confirmed.
"We are sharing information on the case," she added.
A search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimetres tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same colour.
It should come from the Uherské Hradiště region.
Petra worked as a nurse in a London hospital.
Her friends and colleagues are worried about her, as such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Local MP Harriet Harman has joined the search for Petra.
She was involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face on them.
"We are very concerned about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
British police have already arrested one suspect in connection with the disappearance.
But it is not clear who he is and what he had in common with Petra.
Agent Tesla is terrorizing the Czech Republic before Christmas.
While the data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, attacks picked up significantly last month as the end of the year approached.
We saw a big campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the email is intended to attract the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month's dangerous attachment had the word invoice in its title, this time it was labeled as Copy of corrected invoice for 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal of Eset.
The spyware includes features that scan web browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird and Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign in the Czech Republic took place at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of attackers is growing again.
The Formbook spyware remained active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic, and security specialists intercepted campaigns with a global reach in November.
Compared to October's data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but continues to account for nearly a fifth of all detections.
The attacks were continuous throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with the .exe extension, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name "receipt" continues to appear.
An attachment in Czech may be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts have recorded a significant decrease and suppression of activity in the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had any major attack campaigns in the Czech Republic in the last few months.
The demos of today's smart-asses who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated morons.
The parade through Prague was larger than the media reported.
Based on the footage of the parade along the waterfront and my experience as a protester, I'm not afraid to estimate around 10,000 people.
People in the procession filled the waterfront and the bridge and the opposite waterfront road.
That is to say, people really a lot.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously joined the procession of about 4 000 demonstrators.
I claim that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population has led them to find common ground.
Anti-vaxxers, anti-Russians and others alone could not fill or pay for such a large parade.
The events of the Chcípl pes association are growing in popularity, it reminds me of the Million Moments for Democracy inside out.
Sometimes I have the impression that they rent the same stage and equipment.
It's hard to know what kind of movement could be birthed out of this discontent, depending not only on the money coming in, but also on whether Pfizer's three-dose vaccine becomes a four-or-more-dose vaccine.
It certainly won't be a left or centre movement, you bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to get re-vaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
An ingenious action by scientists of which humanity is justly proud.
End of stalemate, Bulgaria has a new prime minister advocating change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has appointed Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption movement Continuing Change, which won the November elections, to form a new government.
He has already succeeded in forming a broad coalition government that should take office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winning parties proclaiming the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not reach an agreement, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
The "secretly" taken footage is a global hit.
Concerns have been growing in Britain over the weekend about the fate of the 32-year-old Czech woman who has been wanted by London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago, driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her current employer and the MP representing the part of London where she lived are calling for information about the children's hospital worker.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behaviour and we are becoming very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncova worked, said in a video released Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to the missing Czech woman, she left work on Sunday 28 November at around 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on 3 December by one of her co-workers.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nurses' assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petra who is missing," the healthcare group said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková, an amateur painter of children's rooms in Šumperk (and also a regional pirate councillor), was accused by an anonymous person of violating copyright with her paintings.
However, the court found that the paintings of the Mole in the rooms in Šumperk did not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a manhole cover had been gaping for a month.
It was a matter of life.
The municipality referred the complaints to the Regional Directorate of Transport, which owns the road, and because it did not respond, the hole continued to disappear.
Eventually, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, ŘSD began to "address the situation intensively".
