Students sing the lead role at ZJU's annual academic conference Research results are mind-blowing - Xinhua
Use the air to wash hands, ha breath to determine disease, and accurately search for the source of haze Last night, a series of brainy academic achievements were honored at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University's 2016 Annual Academic Conference.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers major fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical, life science, humanities and education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with application value, and some of these projects have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your home medical examiner
The team of Zhang Diming, a PhD student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a smartphone-side biosensor, half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to gently exhale, this set of instruments from the composition of your exhaled gas, the initial detection of physical health . "
Zhang Diming said that this set of sensors is connected to the smartphone, and the health report will be displayed on the phone after exhaling the gas.
The smart bracelets on the market that can detect health conditions generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
The biosensor uses graphene, a new material whose target is chemical elements, and its keen "sense of smell" allows it to provide a deeper and more accurate representation of the body's health status.
Intelligent surgical light: the doctor's high-powered eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
The invention won a silver medal at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students in the School of Optical Science and Engineering, has opened new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lights and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
"Many diseases are not detected early and removed properly, and are related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room . "
For example, if a doctor can't see all the tumor tissue in time during an early cancer examination, the cancer cells will spread afterwards, Shin said.
This smart surgical light has four light discs that enhance the degree of differentiation of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the procedure, the surgeon can adjust the spot size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadow-free rate at any time according to the needs of the procedure and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical light has been tried out in hospitals such as Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and received better feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of National Challenge Cup.
Hand washing with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air hand washing device".
Simply by standing on the unit's sink, our weight compresses the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air, which forms a fluid at the faucet, is combined with water.
This way, we can wash our hands clean! "
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of hand washing by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can ensure the degree of washing, but also save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmental protection.
Last year, this invention won the only gold medal among many of the world's top schools at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit.

Feel a very meaningful certificate - first aid certificate
This is one of the skills that I feel is important in addition to my driving license!
Popularization: first aid measures are actually to do emergency rescue when an emergency occurs, that is, the rescue before the ambulance comes.
As we all know, there is actually a period of time during the process of the ambulance coming after the accident, and it is this time that is the most critical.
This is the time when first aid is needed.
If I do have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, then we have a window of four minutes to live, the golden four minutes!
That's why it's so important to have people around you who know first aid!
When someone around us collapses, we can go through the professional knowledge to rescue him, rather than stand there stupidly motionless can not do anything, this helpless feeling is too let people feel terrible.
"In China, we have official figures of three million accidental deaths per year, the most dangerous being called cardiac arrest.
In the United States nationwide is an average of 15% can save over.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, seventy to eighty percent can save over, Shanghai and Beijing less than one percent."
This is what Lu Le, the founder of First Response, said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, breathing is gone, heartbeat is gone, your pinch is of no use.
You must do artificial respiration and chest compressions in order to save the person.
I found that few of us would have the awareness to learn first aid, but when something happens it's too late, so we are urged to learn this skill so that we can react in time when facing an emergency situation.
Maybe it will even save a life!
You can register for a first aid certificate at your local Red Cross training center, I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is a record of what you want to accomplish before you turn 25, and it was a few months ago that you added your first aid certificate to your list of goals, but it did get done!
Next to go to the other certificates you want to take, I intend to take a diving certificate, before seeing in the Little Red Book and a diving first aid certificate, the certificate seems to have to have a first aid certificate to go to the test, so in fact the first aid certificate is still very useful!
I ordered ##NUMBER#
One of them is a $13 shrimp dumpling!
Never tried
How come #NAME# is not clear?
$13 for one?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed a meal delivery, this time just one shrimp dumpling for me!
Because obviously I saw that the code was valid when I entered it before
To start with the conclusion, I personally think "Four Seas" is an all-around bad movie, in every sense of the word.
But you have to say that the film is not a highlight, it is not at least the soundtrack is very well chosen.
There are many kinds of bad movies, the ones that let you sleep soundly in the cinema, and the ones that make you feel righteous anger after watching them, "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
On this point of insulting the audience, Han Han is really gifted.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a gram novel, difficult to name, with as many holes as a trench coat on a pony.
Even after watching it, you may wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it, you find that it is actually a piece of shit.
First of all, I will briefly talk about some of the episodes that I had a hard time understanding.
The main character lives on an island in the south, and his grandmother is dependent on him.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and then the plot was arranged for a grandfather in the neighborhood to drive a minivan to send her to the northeast to see the snow.
Senior citizens in a van from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his dad are still very relieved about it.
Then the old man didn't follow up.
How did the heroine's brother get a business license to open a hotel on a derelict ship?
Why can the island biker punks easily do a section of the mountain road to close the road?
Then the truck delivering the rebar in the middle of the road was parked on the side of the road, and all around even the truck driver could not be found.
This prop sense is also too obvious.
A credit can not and suspected of breaking the law punk speedster why will become a police auxiliary?
Why not call the police in the face of loan sharks, the movie police also specifically asked whether there is a difficult situation?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to open a door with a room card at a hotel, then forcibly arranges to not be able to find the hotelier and sit outside the room door to sleep overnight?
This inexplicable plot is so pervasive throughout the film that it pains me to recall them.
In addition to the plot, what is worse is the main idea of the movie, or rather the movie has no main idea at all, it is a stitching monster with an abominable face.
The beginning of the film you will think he wanted to make a comedy film, more than 20 minutes later you guess it may be an inspirational film, watch half of it you think it may be a drama that wants to reflect the survival of small-town youth is not easy, after watching you do not know what you actually watched, followed by a deep suspicion of their own, the New Year's why to run to the cinema to enjoy the poop.
For most people are actually very familiar with the formula for all kinds of movies, such as you want to shoot motorcyclists, then inspirational + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie step by step to success.
If you want to make a romance, then you can honestly talk about the feud between the young man who likes to ride a motorcycle in a small town and the waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, then at the very least your plot cannot appear to be contrary to the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zheng played the role of the new motorcycle just burned, and then can still sing), you can not go to open some even JFK looked at the brain hole can not be affected.
As for the female lead is obviously not retarded but in some ways behaves like a 5 year old, I really don't know if this is due to the acting or the director's requirements.
There is one more thing I don't understand, Han Han as a racing driver why so keen to add a crash plot in his own film?
Is such a movie arranged in the Chinese New Year slot to add to the audience?

South African doctors: Omicron transmission is strong but mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus is milder than the Delta variant, although it spreads more rapidly.
As the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 physicians in Gauteng, South Africa, reported that the newly crowned patients they are currently treating are experiencing milder symptoms, such as body aches and coughs similar to the flu, according to the Associated Press.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the organization's director, said he sees dozens of patients each day, but none have yet needed to be hospitalized.
They were able to control the disease at home and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation," Pillay said. "
This includes older patients and those with health problems that would have been more likely to become seriously ill from coronavirus infection, he said.
In contrast, he said, the newly crowned patients he treated in the last wave of the Delta outbreak "had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people are hospitalized within a few days ".
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron mutant strain in southern Africa, other physicians shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect sufficient data, the physicians' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the summary of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases of South Africa: only 30% of the newly crowned patients hospitalized in recent weeks were severely ill, half the proportion of severe cases in the previous outbreak; the average length of hospitalization was reduced from 8 to 2.8 days; and only 3% of the recent newly crowned patients died, compared to 20% of the early outbreak cases in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, said: "At this point, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease. "
It's still early days and we need to get late data," he added.
Typically, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we're only two weeks into this wave of the epidemic . "
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are looking at the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the dominant new coronavirus strain worldwide, cases of Omicron are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, Gauteng saw a 400 percent increase in new cases in the first week of December, and tests showed that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90 percent of cases.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes were given away!

Education Times:What does it take to save abducted children?
If analogous to the famous public service announcement "no sale, no kill", then, in a good environment without the demand for "collection of abduction", the group prevention and control, the whole population against abduction, so that trafficking is not profitable, risky and costly, this type of crime will not be repeatedly The company's main goal is to provide the best possible service to its customers.
Recently, the emergency release platform for missing children information developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing child information and the timely recovery of abducted children.
Hearing that the app is called "Reunion", I felt a warm feeling.
New technology means not only the name "literary", full of emotion, and the proper use of information technology, practical, effective.
The primary goal of anti-trafficking law enforcement is to retrieve abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
Only next is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment can be listed in many "big words", from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
However, until the abduction case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victim.
The matter is divided into priorities, in the urgent "rescue" purpose, such as "whether child abduction and trafficking should be all death penalty" and other controversial topics, can be set aside, cautious discussion; but the rescue of abducted children can not wait.
According to the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers are used to moving away from the place of crime as soon as possible after getting their hands on them.
The search for abduction action delayed one more minute, the child may be more away from the parents a step, the difficulty of solving the case will also increase a point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with such an effective solution as the "Reunion" platform that directly helps to solve the case and find the child.
After all, "anti-trafficking" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system to do a good job.
The fight against crime and the protection of children's and parents' rights and interests, from the improvement of legislation, judicial protection, and meticulous enforcement, all need to implement the care of "protecting the young and supporting the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family rests at a train station, the parents are asleep and wake up only to find that the child is missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have adequate self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, one should have at least a fair sense of protection.
Two parents taking turns to rest, or placing the child under secure protection, are the minimum means of preventing child abduction.
From the other side of the police fight against abduction and trafficking crimes, the party that buys abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
A single wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain.
According to China's Criminal Law, the statutory penalty for the crime of child abduction and trafficking starts at five years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, it can be up to the death penalty and confiscation of property.
With the high starting point and heavy maximum penalty, the crime of child abduction and trafficking is clearly a more severe crime under the general trend of "lighter penalties".
However, there are still many cases of abduction and trafficking that occur every year.
It is evident that some people have backward concepts and little legal awareness in raising children.
Legal education for this group of people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we cannot rely on strict official law enforcement alone.
If the abduction "market" is widespread, the traffickers lust for profit, constantly innovative means of abduction, the formation of "fighting" situation with law enforcement, anti-trafficking operations will inevitably fall into the quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking down the backward concept and popularizing common knowledge of the law will also help eradicate the crime of child abduction, sale and purchase.
Yang Haodong preached the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee and the provincial party congress in Maranshan
Drawing strength from the Party's 100-year history of struggle
Hunan Daily, December 10 (All Media Reporter Gong Baiwei) According to the unified arrangement of the provincial party committee, on the morning of December 10, Yang Haodong, member of the standing committee of the provincial party committee and minister of the propaganda department of the provincial party committee, gave an interactive lecture in Maranshan Video Cultural and Creative Park to deeply study and implement the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, study and implement the spirit of important instructions and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping to Hunan and study and implement the spirit of the 12th Party Congress of the province.

The International Olive Oil Association classifies olive oil into two categories and five grades: Virgin Olive Oil and Refined Olive Oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil).
Virgin olive oil, or natural olive oil, is the oil obtained directly from the fresh olives by mechanical cold pressing and filtering to remove foreign substances.
There are three levels depending on the acidity:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Extra Virgin): is the highest grade, highest quality olive oil and is a pure natural product.
Excellent taste, with a light and pleasant vegetal aroma, acidity not exceeding 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil (Fine Virgin): slightly higher acidity, but not more than 2%, pure and aromatic flavor.
Ordinary Virgin: fair taste and flavor, with an acidity of no more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil is the oil obtained from the refining of virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Regular Olive Oil (Olive Oil): Refined olive oil mixed with a certain percentage of virgin olive oil to blend the taste and color, with an acidity of 1.5% or less and a transparent light golden yellow color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Olive oil extracted from pomace by dissolution and refined.
If you have read the classification of grades, you should have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
It is important to know that olives are like grapes for wine making, olives from different regions and different varieties of olives will produce different standards of olive oil.
Best places to grow oil olive:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions in terms of temperature, sunlight, air humidity and precipitation for the growth of olive oil.
Except for the Mediterranean coast, it can only be planted sporadically in suitable areas.
Main production area origin (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and with similar climates in far southern latitudes, Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc.
Months of harvesting of olive oil:
From March to June, the olive trees flower and set fruit. From July to October, the fruit begins to develop and ripen, transitioning from green to red, purple and finally black.
From November to February, the fruit is picked (the freshness of the oil is very important).
Nutritional composition of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid and linoleic and linolenic acids, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most nutritious of the oils found to date.
Democracy Summit comes to an end, Biden says the flame of freedom will never die
The online "Summit for Democracy," convened by President Joe Biden and attended by government and civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, concluded Friday (Dec. 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of every person in the world and that authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold a second global "democracy summit" next year.
Taiwan government representative, Councillor Tang Feng, and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Law Kwun Chung, currently in exile in the United Kingdom, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
We know how difficult the job before us is," Biden said.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because, as I've said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the tiny fire of freedom that burns in the hearts of people all over the world and everywhere. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the parapets of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, and to be more resistant to the buffers and shocks of tyranny and those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good," he said. "
"The second day of the Democracy Summit was devoted to defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening remarks of the day, UN Secretary-General Guterres also said that the cause of democracy faces challenges globally, especially those posed by emerging digital technologies.
It is time to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution . "
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Law Kwun Chung addressed the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding participants of the ongoing concern about the human rights situation in Hong Kong and for China's ethnic minorities, including the Uighurs and Tibetans.
For too long, the world has accepted the rise of China without a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That's why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use what we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority . "
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the Chinese Communist threat.
Maybe some of you are afraid of upsetting General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat [the CCP] poses to our democratic values," he said.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change . "
In a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values," Taiwan Executive Yuan Councilor Tang Feng issued a national statement via video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and power.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the new crown outbreak through information transparency and building mutual trust.
At a time when democracy is still emerging in Taiwan, we are firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and are playing a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments around the world rationalized human rights abuses in the name of public health and the collective good, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
In Taiwan, however, we don't have to seal off the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to take it off the shelves to defeat disinformation . "
While the second day of the Democracy Summit was underway, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in China, North Korea and other countries found to have committed serious human rights abuses, as well as investment restrictions on a Chinese company found to have used surveillance technology to facilitate human rights abuses.

Hello, the restaurant sent the mouthwatering chicken is raw
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I can't stick to it, so I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Not friendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness, if you can not tell, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap racket, this kind of "starter racket" is actually industrial garbage.
They are very low strength, the ball hit the top of the racket, the vibration is very large, hard ball can not be top, the master is very difficult to master.
The logic and subtext of their existence is - tennis is so difficult, know that you can not learn, also know that you do not want to buy expensive, make a cheap fool you, you play twice, you will not play again, so this racket is cheap, you do not feel pain.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, that you progress, then come back to me to buy expensive, I earn money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand better racket, choose prince, or Dunlop's, these two brands are not famous enough, so good racket is not sold on the price, the new racket 500, 600 is very good, second-hand 200, have a thousand dollars racket enjoyment does not smell?
Quite friendly to newcomers, but once you get past the novice stage is chicken, but most people, especially girls, can not get past the novice stage.
Orders have been delayed several times for delivery

In fact, there is a lot to be said about dressing girls with a slight body fat.
Body fat girls wear skirts can not be too short or too long, the length is almost in the knee, just enough to cover the fat thighs.
The skirt is too short will show the fat on the legs.
Too long will give the impression of being short and fat.
If you wear a split top, middle and bottom, it will look like you are naturally taller, that is, the upper body, skirt and stockings with different colors, it will look like a slender feeling .

Wearing dark colored clothes, especially short black skirts, will make people think you are thinner.
If your calves are fat, your socks and shoes should not be worn in a way that draws too much attention to them.
The more popular the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
So that people don't get the feeling of being fat when they pay attention to your legs and feet.
For slightly chubby girls must talk about the knack of dressing well with.
Slightly fat girls should never wear tight short skirts, in addition to tops not too short or stuffed in the skirt, will make people look very uncomfortable, if the legs are thick, to wear black stockings or grid socks (fine plaid kind oh), choose a soft texture of the print flare skirt, with a swing collar top, can be a good cover up the fat girl's shortcomings.
Of course, the slightly fat girl in wearing a short skirt is also a matter of concern.
Fat girls wearing short skirts should choose tops that are the same color as the short skirt, which will give your chubby body the effect of adding height.
Short skirt with high heels, you can make your legs look more slender, this is the most IN summer with Oh!
If you are a MM with a fat upper body but thin legs, we recommend choosing a short dress with a gorgeous feel.

What is the hottest thing in 2021?
Undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Some time ago there was an article "Look! Project managers can impact the gold medal Olympic project" article is very hot, which mentioned that project managers in many projects, absolutely can be the first, no one can match: moving bricks, travel, stay up late is the daily life of project managers, fire fighting, take the blame, apologize is not in the conversation.
A seemingly joking and flirtatious article, but also speaks to the daily hardships of project managers, behind the representative of the current project management work is not able to do.
The people who work in project management are gradually choosing to get themselves out of the rut at work by taking some actions.
Judging from the rising number of PMP (Internationally Certified Project Management Professional) enrollment each year, more and more project management practitioners are studying to improve their project management skills.
According to the "China Project Management Twenty-Year Development Report (1999-2019)", by September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified people was about 420,000, and the number of valid holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has been increasing year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer desirable to simply copy the old "experience" to do things, and the ever-changing work environment lets us know that one has to learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, can the PMP exam guarantee unimpeded project management work?
Many project management beginners say that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten domains of project management and the five process groups and other related knowledge points, but they are still confused when they really carry out project management work.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: project management cognition is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, do not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, the work can not be landed, project estimates are not accurate, poor control degree sensitivity, the project is delayed again and again; members of the division of labor is not clear, the team of "old grease "Do not know how to cope with cross-departmental assistance communication is not smooth, the project is difficult to advance ......
Therefore, focusing on the field of product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, Zhongtianhua Xia Consulting, which has helped many outstanding enterprises train a large number of product managers, project managers and other key R&D talents, and has won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" and other honorary titles, is here with the online course "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp .

We will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, and rich templates and forms to help participants apply what they have learned to their work after the class.

Jebsen advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double 12" - Economic Observation Network - Professional financial news website
This year's "Double 11" carnival national network payment business transaction amounted to 1.77 trillion yuan, a record high compared to previous years.
On the one hand, people sigh at the increasing strength of national consumption power, but on the other hand, they have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of "Double 12", Gitzo Consumer Finance Co., Ltd (hereinafter referred to as "Gitzo") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse to blindly consume and overspend.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
In general, our residents perform well at the financial consumption level, but reflect a wide variability in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and need to further improve their basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will continue to be the focus of financial education; Nielsen's "China Young People's Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential. Credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation, although the younger generation shows an overall trend of rational consumption, although it is very different from the label of "excessive spending", some young people do have excessive consumption, follow the trend of consumption behavior, and therefore This has resulted in excessive financial pressure and debt risk, and even led to a gradual increase in social problems, so financial companies should be brave enough to assume social responsibility and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Gitzo has been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with quality and caring services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct view of consumption, and actively responding to regulatory calls to raise consumers' awareness of rational consumption, especially among young people, with practical actions.
Over the past years, Gitzo has been carrying out comprehensive and diversified financial literacy activities for young people, including college students, and has been working with top universities in China to launch innovative practice competitions and other forms to guide young people's consumption needs, helping them to establish rational consumption concepts and plan their consumption needs rationally, thus helping them to accumulate wealth in life.
On the occasion of the 12th of February, Gitzo reminds all consumers and friends to establish a reasonable sense of consumption and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid the misunderstanding of consumer lending to avoid affecting personal credit and future economic life.
Be sure to plan ahead when spending and pay back on time within your means.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may adversely affect the economic life such as buying a car or a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Gitzo will continue to bring more tailored and diversified services to consumers with its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated and iterated financial products, helping consumers to improve their financial knowledge and cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, so as to be a lifelong and reliable consumer finance partner for consumers.

Vietnam People's Daily Online - GCC tackles common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit by Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on the country in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing it of supporting terrorist groups and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the January 2021 GCC summit, when the Gulf states signed an agreement to move toward "unity and stability" mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in both countries.
The Gulf Arab states resolved their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar out of the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and the stability of the region, with the aim of addressing common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long link between the two countries will facilitate travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of both countries.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies from both countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincides with negotiations between Iran and world powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - a deal that Gulf Arab states have condemned for what they see as its inability to resolve the missile issue with Iran.
Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a long-term "competitor" and its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that failure to address the Iranian missile issue and take action to curb Iranian activities in the region is flawed.
Saudi Arabia entered into direct negotiations with Iran against the backdrop of the failure of the nuclear talks between the major powers and Iran to meet the wishes of the various Gulf states.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down economic growth in the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of GCC countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing measures that will enable its member states to cooperate fully to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

This time our team brings you this car that is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the replacement for the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
Asking RM nearly two million, a year of road tax RM more than ten thousand, four-wheel drive, why is called LP700?
Because with 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast?
That forget about the editor also do not know, the data said 0-100km / h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds, probably is the editor's myvi only to 30km / h when people to 100km / h, well.
The low body, the arrogant scissor doors, the huge air intakes all around the body and the 6.5 v12 engine visible under the glass perfectly illustrate the Lamborghini style.
For the description of the car models do not need to say too much, Google it yourself, I have organized some Google may not give the explanation!
Too much attention, go where everyone is watching, very uncomfortable! (Actually a little cool)
1km fuel cost is around RM1 (the owner does not care)
On and off the posture to practice a little, otherwise it will be a little embarrassing (because it will not climb out of the cabin and then stuck half)
The sound of the engine is so loud that you will be instantly deaf when you get out of the car. (But still very cool)
The car is too big, parked in a normal parking space will be very narrow, very afraid of being knocked by the next car when opening the door!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (the editor speaks for himself, has nothing to do with the owner of the car, ha ha)
Don't get me wrong, this video of the supercar is not for sale, sorry!
If you want to shoot a video for your car, welcome to contact us!

Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times-Xinhua
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of philosophy and value pursuit formed by a university in the process of development for a long time, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the university spirit has been vital to political, economic, cultural, scientific and social development, and even to the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, the university has taken on a unique mission different from that of other social organizations. For our university, which emerged in the autumn of the national crisis, its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the values of "Ming De Ji Shi, Xiu Qi Zheng Ping" and "The spirit of the university is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times.
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious, and the global competition for education, science and technology, and talent is intensifying, and the structural reform of higher education, as an important "supply side", is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the "Overall Plan for Coordinating the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines", while demonstrating China's confidence and determination to move forward from a large to a strong higher education country, has put forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How to strive to be among the world's top in a relatively short period of time, and accelerate the establishment of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap to achieve "overtaking"?
In addition to firm confidence in goals, paths and abilities, universities should also give full play to three kinds of advantages: first, the latecomer advantage, through the continuous introduction of outstanding academic talents from overseas and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve significant improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the cultural advantage, inherit the wisdom content accumulated in Chinese civilization for five thousand years, promote and develop excellent traditional culture, so as to coalesce, brand and enhance the image; third, the institutional advantage, give full play to the superiority of the socialist national system, strengthen the goal-driven, gather consensus and synergy, and optimize resource allocation to provide a solid guarantee for the university to accelerate catching up with the world advanced level. The third is the institutional advantage, giving full play to the superiority of the system of the socialist country, strengthening the goal-driven, gathering consensus and synergy, optimizing resource allocation, and providing sustainable and solid guarantee for the university to accelerate catching up with the world's advanced level.
In particular, we should be aware that the construction of world-class universities can not be a thousand schools, each school in the strengths, at the same time, must highlight the individuality and characteristics.
The characteristics of school operation should have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique target positioning, school tradition and resource endowment.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we focus on highlighting three characteristics in running the university: first, highlighting the characteristics of training innovative and entrepreneurial talents, building an integrated education environment with the integration of science and education and university-enterprise integration, and forming a whole chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second, highlighting the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promoting the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, creating an institutional environment for interdisciplinary crossover, and actively cultivating crossover emerging disciplines and landmark crossover achievements. Third, highlight the characteristics of school system and social services, carry out deep international exchange and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of Pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, so that the spirit of the university resonates with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking truth and innovation", the common values of "diligent learning, cultivating virtue, discernment and practicality" and the common values of "accepting the rivers, enlightening the truth and virtue, opening up the things before the people, and shaping our country" together constitute the latest expression of the spirit of Zhejiang University. "together constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of school operation, continuously accumulate cultural height and cohesion of spiritual power, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching significance.
Among them, the "sea of rivers" emphasizes the spirit of openness and tolerance, reflecting the "world's talents for my use" of the mind, expressed in the learning of the world's leading universities to run the quality of education and education concept; "the true and thick virtue " emphasizes the spirit of truth-seeking and goodness, which means that while pursuing truth, the university should receive the cultivation of virtue and the sharpening of personality; " open up the things before the people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes both the search for new knowledge and innovation in scientific research, as well as the reform and development, and the reform of the old and the new; The spirit of patriotism and dedication is emphasized in "Make our country a better place", which means that the university should always share the fate of the nation.
This series of spiritual philosophy and value pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University in its 120 years of operation.
"The intelligent person hears in silence, and the wise person sees in the unformed " .
Chinese universities should further base on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the orientation of the times and the historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, it adheres to humanistic concern and independent freedom, so that the university spirit and the spirit of the times and the national spirit can stir each other, thus providing inexhaustible power to achieve national prosperity and national revitalization and realize the common ideal of human beings.

As NFT is flaming out of the ring, a new concept has emerged from the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity made a huge impact in Southeast Asia, where some residents who had lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn a steady income in the game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-raising game with blockchain technology as the underlying layer, which collects multiple ways to play including NFT and is the highest traded NFT project with over $3 billion as of now.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily revenue exceeds $8.2 million, which is close to that of "King's Quest".
On August 6 of this year, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily active users have exceeded 1 million.
With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single player, but can participate in the governance of the game ecosystem in addition to having fun and gaining financial benefits from the game.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
See a news about friends share price, my biggest feeling is the choice of companies in the track, which means the choice of the underlying industry for investment, first of all, to choose the industry with large growth space, at least 100 billion market size; secondly, to choose the industry with good future growth, consider the industry with the best state of industry growth after the next 3-5 years; finally, to choose the industry with policy support.
How wide the track refers to the market size, how long the track refers to the development stage of the industry, the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
The first thing to do in the new year is to take stock of 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
The tactic is to "do the things right".
The strategy is to "do the right thing", that is, to do the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding direction, tactics lie on the ground, and on top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on top of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend in the horizontal field (strategic thinking); for example, on top of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of improving activity engagement (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the right activity KPI to achieve On top of improving activity engagement (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the right activity KPIs to achieve the right activity goals, such as improving target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and pulling in new customers precisely; on top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years in the making, Bitcoin is celebrating several milestone events in 2021.

Asian American group complains about admissions discrimination at Yale and 3 other Ivy League schools-Xinhua
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 130 Asian American groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23 to protest against three Ivy League schools -- Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College -- for discriminating against Asian applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Coalition, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington the same day.
The number of Asian applicants eligible for admission to top U.S. schools has grown exponentially over the past 10 years, but the percentage of Asians at the three top U.S. schools has remained at essentially the same level, the group's president, Yu-Kong Cho, said at the conference.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities "systematically discriminate against Asian applicants over time" in a so-called "holistic" admissions process.
Cho Ukong described a 2014 study by Sanders and other scholars that showed that Asians had the lowest acceptance rate of all ethnicities relative to the number of applicants at the three colleges.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest percentage of admissions for Asian students of all Ivy League schools, and that Yale and Brown have imposed de facto racial quotas on Asian applicant students for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expect that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice will investigate and take measures to stop these colleges from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after the facts are determined.
They also expect the colleges and universities under complaint to be proactive about the issue and change their admissions policies toward Asians.
At present, the three universities under complaint have not yet responded.
The Asian Education Coalition, founded in 2015, had complained about admissions discrimination at Harvard at the time, but the U.S. Department of Education did not take it up on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese American groups, the complaint also included Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American, and Pakistani American education groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from the housing agency about a plant located in the town of Yuyao zhangting, Zhejiang Province, and after several site visits, Mr. Lu decided to buy the plant.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu on the details of the purchase of the plant and the family of the owner of the house Lin Mou after consultation, on the same day by bank transfer remittance of 200,000 yuan for the deposit.
Lin in the "plant sale deposit receipt" as the recipient of the signature, which contains, "If the buyer does not want to buy this plant, this deposit to the seller, such as the seller is not willing to sell this plant, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, the parties agreed to sign the plant sale contract within a week."
However, the two parties failed to form an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the plant sale and the payment method afterwards, resulting in the delay in the signing of the housing sale contract.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
It is easy to look at the house, the deposit paid, the house is also ready, just "a foot in the door" to sign the contract, the seller is not sold, which makes Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao City People's Court.
The court concluded that the failure of the two parties to sign a formal contract could not be attributed to the defendant alone, and it should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed, so the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant did not need to bear the responsibility of double return of the deposit for breach of contract.
After the first trial, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original verdict.
[Lawyer Reminder] Exercise the necessary due diligence in the transaction process.
When signing the contract, as a buyer, you have to do the necessary prudential care obligations, for example, to verify the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied and other relevant information, and to specify in the contract about the specific time and place of delivery, in order to prevent disputes between the two parties when performing the contract.
（After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States had organized the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" to "draw ideological lines, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, use democracy as a pretext to fight against democracy, incite division and confrontation, and divert domestic conflicts".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, pursued 'democratic transformation', imposed indiscriminate unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions', with disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'weapon of mass destruction' for U.S. intervention in other countries.
The summit was a move by Biden to make good on his campaign promises.
The two-day conference was conducted by video and 111 leaders from around the world were invited, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia slammed the U.S. for problems with its own democracy, saying it was not qualified to host such a summit.
And there are skeptical voices both internationally and within the United States, such as those criticizing the fact that the invited participants include leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as those of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and some suspecting that the Biden administration's real intentions are not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes in organizing the summit.
The recently appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the Video Democracy Summit
China's foreign ministry said in a statement Saturday that "today's American democracy is sickly, with money politics, identity politics, party rivalry, political polarization, social division, racial tensions, and polarization between rich and poor getting worse" and that American democracy is a "rich man's game" based on capital.
President Joe Biden said in his speech , " As leaders in government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to shore up the guardrails of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, and to be more resistant to the buffers and shocks of tyranny and those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good . "
He stressed that democracy is not something to be taken for granted , " we must renew it in each generation, which, in my opinion, is the defining challenge of our time . "
Biden added that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend democracy in the face of continuing and troubling challenges.
For its part, the U.S. has pledged to follow this Democracy Summit with a year-long initiative consisting of a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support for independent news media.
The United States expects countries to make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems in advance of a physical democracy summit planned for late 2022.
Biden said, "Let's all follow through on our commitments and report next year on the progress we've made.
Okay, I'm just afraid he sent it to the wrong address

What is the way to drink Red Label Whiskey?
Everyone's hobby is different, some people like to collect, some people like food, of course, some people like to taste wine, Red Label Whisky is currently one of the best-selling Scotch whisky in various countries, and Red Label Whisky has won the gold medal in the International Foreign Wine Competition.
Each bottle of Red Label whisky has a unique flavor, but if you don't know how to taste it, it would not be a waste of its mellow flavor.
So how do you drink Red Label whiskey?
I will briefly introduce it to you.
How to drink Red Label Whiskey:
Johnnie Walker Red Label Whisky is a blend of approximately 35 Scotch whiskies, with a rich, aromatic and traditional Scotch character, sweet and smoky aroma.
The palate is full-bodied and fresh, with a slight hint of vanilla and strong smoky malt.
The wine can be served straight on the rocks or mixed with a favorite beverage.
Red Label Whiskey entered the country, in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese, Red Label Whiskey + Coke or Sprite or Sunkist and other fizzy drinks become an enduring fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to neutralizing the acidity and bringing visual pleasure, can be added to the drink to dilute the taste of alcohol and change the texture.
Red Label Whiskey + lemon slices + sugar (sugar can also be used), is the most authentic and traditional way to drink.
The authentic Red Fang Wai is a bit sour, so adding sugar will neutralize the sourness and lemon will give the wine a refreshing aroma, but of course, the sweetness and acidity can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The above three are the best way to drink Red Label whisky, you can try as a reference, I hope that the introduction of the editor can help you.
Education thinking: how to make the "bully" " " dregs" of the university exams to get their own - Xinhua
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the university leaders, reflecting their confusion about the university exams and putting forward the demand to increase the difficulty of the exams, change the type of questions and make the exams truly reflect the actual level of students.
Indeed, university exams have long been a "hot topic".
On college campuses, students come from all over the world with varying levels of ability, which, combined with varying levels of study, makes for a wide variety of learning situations.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings about the assessment of a group with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam test questions are single, high repetition rate, and the questions are too simple, it will certainly cause another very different feeling.
Students who do not work hard may be able to pass with a concentrated blitz before the exam, and if they think of other ways, it is possible to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
In this way, there is a "dregs" usually do not put in can also pass, and even scored high; " hegemony" usually never miss class, homework, notes are good, the test is not much higher than the "strange status quo " .
In this way, it seems that the problems reported by students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University in the university examinations are not unwarranted, and I believe that this situation does not exist only in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In that sense, kudos to the three students who wrote the letter and presented it directly.
In fact, people who have been to college are well aware that it is not uncommon for people to prepare for exams unannounced, to find various ways to "get" exam questions from teachers, to get the scope of the exam, to get "key tutoring" before the exam, and even to carry a cheat sheet in the exam, after the exam to beg the teacher to lift the hand The situation is not uncommon.
In my opinion, as a kind of teaching quality assessment guide, the measure of a university examination's passing or failing lies more in the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific proposition based on it.
As you enter the undergraduate level, majors begin to break down and many major courses focus on the basics.
It goes without saying that a thorough grasp of the basic knowledge of a subject is what is examined in university exams.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic general knowledge of the subject, and in terms of knowledge, there is not much room for change, and it is basically fixed.
As one teacher put it, "The basics of college math that were learned 20 years ago are still being learned today and are still the focus. "
However, the knowledge is basically the same, does not mean that the exam questions are single and repeated.
In many universities, exams are usually composed of question teams, and then the senior teachers of the subject coordinate the composition of the papers, and the exams are marked by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so that the duplication of questions can be overcome to some extent.
However, in order to develop a set of test questions in line with the actual teaching and learning, the questions are normally distributed in terms of difficulty and ease according to the overall situation of student learning, and it is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the extent of student learning, so that the test questions have a dynamic grasp of difficulty and ease and question type, which can highlight the examination of basic knowledge and also take into account the ability test, as well as the innovative design of the question type.
Examinations are the baton of university education. What kind of examinations are available, students will have corresponding preparation programs, which will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
For the students' suggestion letter, Lanzhou Jiaotong University's administration attaches great importance to it and has deployed a plan to rectify the situation in the whole university.
Each teaching unit is required to organize teachers to conduct seminars and self-examination against the course final examinations, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and review links, refine the grade evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
From the mechanism to solve the problem of a single type of test questions, questions such as repetition is a university examination needs to face the issue, of course, the need to introduce the corresponding system, but the work is expensive in the daily, the need for teachers to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to eat through the teaching content, but also to eat through the student learning situation, both ends eat through, teaching and learning will be better docking, the formation of positive interaction, the examination will also be more in line with the actual, so that The "school bully" and "school dregs" each get their own.

48 hours negative nucleic acid, set up a "buffer zone," the State Council joint prevention and control mechanism issued a document to strengthen the port city epidemic prevention and control-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Dec. 11 (Xinhua Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) the State Council joint prevention and control mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring recent departures from land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macau with ports) personnel need to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, to land border port cities for at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival Testing.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date when the provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities determine the scope of the port city and announce it, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that the port city with conditions can study the setting of epidemic prevention and control buffer zone in the jurisdiction.
National Health and Health Commission Disease Prevention and Control Bureau is responsible for the introduction of some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, the two sides of the frequent exchanges of border people.
The implementation of zoning differentiated management policy, from a spillover prevention and control line of defense into two lines of defense, is expected to achieve the gateway to move forward, compress the risk of spillover of the epidemic, with the minimum social impact, the lowest social cost to achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control.
Recently, there have been a number of local aggregated outbreaks in China, all of which were imported from overseas via port cities.
The above notice points out that this reveals that some local epidemic monitoring and early warning is not timely, the closed-loop management of high-risk positions is not implemented, regular nucleic acid testing is a formality, the cold chain items are not in place in all aspects of disinfection, the management of centralized isolation sites is not standardized, and the emergency response to epidemics is not scientific and precise enough.
The notice requires that from the perfection of the port city epidemic prevention and control mechanism, sound epidemic monitoring and early warning system, the implementation of border control measures and other 9 aspects of efforts to speed up to make up for the shortcomings of the port city prevention and control weaknesses, without relaxation, scientific and accurate prevention and control work, weaving and firm foreign defense input defense.
The notice stressed that the port cities should synchronize the study and deployment of epidemic prevention and control with the work of livelihood protection, publish and open the hotline of livelihood protection, regularly investigate the seeds of potential problems in the supply of basic living materials and prices, and promptly solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the public.
According to the notice, which refers to the port city including open land, waterways, air ports in the county (city, district, flag ), where the city (prefecture, state, alliance) and the municipality directly under the Central Government, the specific scope of the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of prevention and control of the epidemic to determine and timely announcement.

Oil tube video underlines the truth of 20 years of bloodthirsty killings by the U.S. military - Xinhua
(Video source: Oil Tube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machine" on the oil pipe platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launched the war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exported American-style democracy through war, 20 years of militarism, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocent people, committing all kinds of crimes against humanity.
The misuse of drones to airstrike civilian places such as hospitals and schools distorts humanity and sets up killing squads.
For 20 years, U.S. forces have killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military set up "black jails" to torture and physically humiliate the "suspects".
A crime against humanity stirs up more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the US-style "war on terror" is "getting more and more terroristic".
The war has not brought peace and democracy and hope for prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Let's expose the truth of America's bloodthirsty killings in the name of "anti-terrorism" and the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I accidentally saw the following article, from the commercial point of view and the preservation period of the perspective of why the customer wants the logistics company inside the bonded zone to help do canning, although canning belongs to the deep processing, does not belong to the bonded logistics company's business scope, here the following text may explain why the customer wants to do so?
I go to many manufacturers of milk powder and touch many production lines of milk powder.
In fact, the bagged and listened to milk powder their raw materials are exactly the same, there is no difference.
So you will surely ask: why the shelf life of the bag is one year, while the shelf life of the listen is two years or longer?
Or ask again: why is there such a big difference in price between listened and bagged?
In fact, from this point on many consumers, or mother level that this is because the raw materials are different so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, just everyone thinks that the expensive is good.
There are also consumers who eat out of this mindset and then respond by saying that the taste or flavor of the listening suit is different!
Now I will talk to you first about the reason why listening to the suit is expensive, where is it expensive?
They have the same raw materials why the price difference is so big?
Because most of the manufacturers in the pricing of the time to consider if the bag pricing is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that manufacturers generate very low profits, or no profit, then manufacturers rely on what to survive it?
So they have a big upside in the pricing of the listening suit to protect their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote listening to the bag, rather than the bag.
And you want so many manufacturers to spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year on advertising, where does this cost come from?
Everyone can imagine.
Then with the development of the society, the promotion cost of the market, such as: the promotion staff of the mall, the display cost of the mall, the product giveaway cost, the advertising cost, etc. is also increasing.
So various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and is listening to the suit, its price is also rising, in fact, this is with the increase in market costs out of the new products.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, their raw materials increase the cost of up to no more than 3 or 4 dollars.
There is also a part of the brand, in order to promote their products, by any means, linked to the hospital doctors, who assist in the promotion of the product, from a hear inside the profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
And the relevant Chinese law is absolutely not allowed to operate in this way, in fact, this practice is in the victimization of consumers.
We recommend that you buy bags of milk powder in cans if you have cans at home, so that you can save money while increasing the preservation and sealing of the milk powder, and there is no effect on small children.
And we should not think that the shelf life of listening to the bag is longer than the bag, if the shelf life of listening to the bag and the bag is the same after the opening, only that the bag is not easy to save after the opening, easy to moisture deterioration.

Don't scare people off the starting line - Xinhua
When you visit the book market, you can often feel the fire of success books.
Many of today's success books preach the "best principle" - that is, assuming or implying that you can "do it" and then telling you what you need to do "What".
It means that the most important and fundamental aspect is "how to do it", which has been crossed at once.
Because of this, these books all have a common feature - either you do the best you can in one fell swoop, or you do nothing at all; either you are 100, or you are 0; either you climb Mt.
This "best principle", let anyone look at it will admit that "right beyond belief", but 99% of people will be intimidated in front of the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, be a new person, make a 180 degree change", which is precisely the Achilles heel of many people.
For people who are stuck in the old ways and refuse to change, you have to shout "you want to change" in their ears, which is undoubtedly self-deceiving and playing the piano.
The vast majority of people will be in front of the word "transformation" cowardly, stagnant, difficult to make up their minds; or with the impulse of the moment painful "transformation" of the determination, and bravely take the first step, but often is a good scene is not long, stick to more than a moment to It is difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous comic strip "From Tomorrow" is the most evocative expression of this "universal humanity" classic.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is so high that it often exceeds the limits of the average person's ability, leaving the majority of people to "sigh in disbelief".
Perhaps the "second-best principle" is a way to put more ordinary people on the road to relative success.
The core of the "second-best principle" is "lowering the bar" - it encourages a theory of "small wins make big wins". The theory that if you can't do 100, it's okay to do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0. If you can't climb Mount Tai, it's okay to climb the sand dune on your doorstep, because that's better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is better than not doing it.
Since the threshold is significantly lowered, there is more possibility to make ordinary people do persist, and the probability of success in everything will be increased as long as they persist.
The road to success is just a little longer when you follow the "next best thing".
In short, although the "best principle" is apparently a banner for everyone to succeed, it can ultimately motivate a small number of people; the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.

Qinghai Lake naked carp resource reserves increased by 0.71 million tons this year-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, Dec. 11 (Xinhua Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang), the reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development that the latest monitoring results show that the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, compared with the initial protection in 2002, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times.
The Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as the "Huanghuang fish", is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, and plays a pivotal role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake declined sharply due to human harvesting and the degradation of the naked carp breeding waters, and in 2002 the naked carp resource in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
The Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species in 2004.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of the lake for fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has been increasing year by year through measures such as artificial stocking and cleaning up the main rivers into the lake and designing a scientific and reasonable "fish passage".
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that up to now, the artificial stocking of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has accumulated nearly 180 million tails, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Three River Source area in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water-covering area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the spread of desertification to the east in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the three rivers and Qinghai Lake waters, protect aquatic wildlife and maintain the biodiversity of the Tibetan Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has released the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, Qinghai Lake key waters ban notice, the construction of a "river, a river and a lake" comprehensive ban on fishing management system.

I just came across an article about regular holidays that was too long.
For men who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period sometime between the ages of 13 and 15, and menopause around the age of 50.
After that it will come more regularly once a month provided that you are healthy.
However, it is not so regular that it can be accurately predicted, about a week or so of tolerance, need to prepare in advance, and sometimes bad luck can roll over (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, the amount of blood, the degree of menstrual pain varies from person to person, some people three days, some people a week; some people flow less, some big blood crash; some people have little reaction, some people pain to the ambulance transport away, menstrual pain will change with time, before no pain does not mean a lifetime without pain.
You can't control your menstruation, you bleed 24 hours a day for a few days from the beginning to the end, and all you can do is use a sanitary napkin or tampon to absorb the blood to prevent it from flowing onto your clothes and chair.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen when the physiological period has just started before the dysmenorrhea can effectively relieve the pain of the month, it is of little use to take it after the dysmenorrhea has started.
Pre-menstrual period is prone to diarrhea due to uterine congestion and excessive prostaglandin release.
If it is about time for your cycle and you have inexplicable diarrhea, you will basically get your period within two days.
Sanitary napkin best two or three hours to change once, or easy to breed bacteria, excluding sleep time, the worst case is to change 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces, if you add the share prepared in advance may have 50 pieces, and not every month with a piece.
(modified here, tampons do not need to be changed often, about five or six hours to change once on, up to eight hours)
The hormones during menstruation may be more cranky, ovulation will also be unstable because of the hormonal changes in the body, is very unlucky, the body to make their own trip.
But the official crime rate data shows that women are still very good at controlling their emotions and do not make excuses for emotional problems.
The flow is not just blood, it contains the shed endometrium.
After the end of menstruation, the uterine lining is the thinnest, after slowly become thicker, can be understood as the uterus is a house, each month to build a house (lining thickened) ready to welcome guests, guests did not come, all demolished (menstruation discharge) next month to build a new house, and so on.
Menstruation is inconvenient, continuous for decades, bleeding for 24 hours for several days each month, and also abdominal pain and back pain, who wants to?
But a person can be born because his mother had her period, and the period is to prepare the house where you will live for 10 months when you come into the world for the first time, and everyone should be grateful that his mother had her period regularly and healthily.
A lot of things about women used to be suppressed, society brainwashed women that it was dirty and shameful, and people thought that was it, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, that the act of preparing the female body for the conception of life is disgusting and should not be said in public, girls stand up and stop thinking that way, men who have never experienced it and will never experience it in this life and do not know much about it, do not be so ungrateful not knowing what is good for you, how can you face your own mother with this attitude and how can you want your own children?
Finally, the sisters try tampons, really good.
Today is the winter solstice holiday, send the wrong more disappointing
To order additional meals for children to eat
I hope the store is busy to check the production
Footbath soaking feet numb is a leakage of electricity?
Choose the right footbath can play a good role in foot health care, today the Gomez editor will answer this question, I hope it will help friends.
As people's health care awareness, footbaths are increasingly popular among consumers, and a large number of different grades of products have emerged in the market, from more than a hundred to thousands of dollars of footbaths in a wide range, giving consumers a lot of space to choose.
In the relevant data surface, compared with traditional home appliances, footbaths and other health care appliances sales boom, but footbaths are not specifically industry standards, so there are certain safety hazards.
"Soaking your feet in electrically charged water is just too dangerous!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a footbath to his father as a birthday gift, but his father felt numbness in the soles of his feet when soaking.
Mr. Li at first thought that the vibration function of the footbath caused, did not expect to turn off the vibration function, the father still felt the soles of the feet numb.
Mr. Lee tried with an electric pen, the electric pen actually lit up, Mr. Lee was surprised to find that the water in the footbath was actually charged.
Later he contacted the merchant, the merchant's attitude was not bad, despite the return of the footbath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that the footbath has been popular for a long time now in the maximum temperature setting, for what kind of people, what materials to ensure that harmless and other aspects are not a clear and detailed industry regulations.
But in general the footbath will not have the problem of electricity, but does not exclude a few products in the factory without strict control.
Therefore, in the purchase of the choice of split footbath.
Water and electricity are separated without any safety hazards.
At the same time you can just take the electric pen to measure.

Ding Zilin: To a friend.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of you for the humanitarian assistance you have provided for more than 30 years since the death of our loved ones, especially since I made a personal appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, which has been uninterrupted so far.
Today, the majority of the victims' elderly parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and become employed.
It was your act of kindness that helped our stricken families get through the most difficult times.
The new crown epidemic is currently raging around the world, and most of the donors are now in their retirement years.
Therefore, I earnestly request you to suspend your humanitarian donations to the Tiananmen Mothers, a group of our hard-hearted family members, as this humanitarian relief campaign should have been brought to a perfect conclusion long ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous acts will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, so please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Ye Press: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of IFCSS and the Minnesota China Foundation for Democracy (MCDF) in humanitarian relief.
In engaging in humanitarian relief, ACSL and the Minnesota Foundation for Democracy in China are two parallel organizations, with program implementers often intersecting.

Relief money often does not reach the victims of June 4.
In 1994, at Ms. Ding's suggestion, a special group was set up by the Tiananmen Mothers to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of the humanitarian aid.
In 1998, MCDF established the June 4th Orphans Education Fund. After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans had graduated from college, MCDF then established the June 4th Orphans Special Needy Families Relief Fund, which has been implemented ever since.
Funding for these programs, primarily from campus and community donations in the year of June 4, comes from generous individual contributions and is supported by the Foundation for Democracy at sister universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
It was only last year, after 31 years, that the families of the June 4 victims finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong in the name of June 4.
During this time, Human Rights in China was also independently implementing their humanitarian aid program.
We understand that Mr. Ding stopped the June 4 donation for the sake of the donors, and that we are indeed retired seniors whose income is not as abundant as before we retired, so we would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding for his letter "To Friends.
We will respect the decision of the refugees to terminate this program within two years and resume it as soon as needed.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those who have been so generous and risky in delivering humanitarian aid over the years.

Thank you for the rabbit's review originally said that the rejection of the ancient style is not suitable for the ancient style, but I did not expect the finished product out simply too beautiful
Thank you Dandan for your approval, your satisfaction will make us full of electricity to continue to move forward, we will continue to cheer!
This photography studio is really great. Highly recommend all the little ones to come!
The reception, makeup, costumes, lighting, photography and post-production are all impeccable.
The makeup artist is particularly delicate and will match your style with a makeup look that suits you, and the cosmetics used are all first-tier major brands.
Tian Liang teacher, not to mention the photography that is quite professional.
The whole studio has a very artistic atmosphere, and there are two small cats accompanying and playing.
We are working in Beijing, Beijing good point of the studio need to line up six months in advance, colleagues have shot in Beijing, look at the finished film think just so so.
I purposely sought out this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, think this is also the short version of most people, the photographer Ryo will capture, record the natural wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post design, a fine team.
Out into a film we as well as the people around us are full of praise.
I have already recommended my girlfriend to go there, and she has just seen the negatives and is also full of joy.
I hope that such studios are not buried, more people find ta, shoot out their own style, rather than the same old thing.
Thank you very much for the five-star review, both of you are very thoughtful and creative newcomers, we are the creative studio, as long as the customer likes we are doing our best to complete 200%, thanks for meeting us!
Sweet and caring assistants, lively and cheerful photographer teachers, everyone in the team is super nice A wonderful shoot, a very unforgettable experience, and the results are much better than I imagined Everyone has worked hard, thank you very much 😘😘

If you intend to enter the industry is the choice to find a place for training, but if there is no idea in this regard, it is best to learn on your own, after all, training to spend a lot of money, and also with 6 months of time to learn.
But if you are planning to enter the pit in this industry then training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who have weak self-control and training is a very good choice.
If you have more self-control, you can also choose to study on your own, but it will be more tiring.
Of course choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
The first thing to look at the institution's faculty, if the faculty is not strong enough, the training institution is not meaningful, of course, some new training institutions are not particularly strong faculty.
Secondly, before choosing to explore this training institution, it is best to explore the students who come out of this institution, after all, only the students of the institution will know how this institution in the end, explain the course is good or bad.
Hello, in fact, you ask this question I do not know how to answer, because for your own situation did not do a certain introduction, and study this thing and the individual's own situation has a lot to do with the.
Things like major, age, the language you want to study, and even the city you are in will all have a bearing on the industry you are studying or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or a computer professional has graduated, then if you have enough time I personally recommend self-learning, this is the least efficient and costly, now many offline training institutions are actually very good, but a high cost of learning, the second investment of time is more, the basic need to focus on training 3-6 months.
But if these are the cases I mentioned, self-learning is very convenient, now many learning resources on the network are free, or go to the b site also has a lot of training resources, if you will not find resources, you can also contact me through the profile to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive study.
If you are not a computer professional, but also able to pay a certain amount of money and time cost of learning, then it is recommended to go to a training institution, so that learning does not have to be very laborious, the teacher explained in detail, there are also people dedicated to answer questions, in addition to learning planning or supervision is also helpful.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are internal promotion quota, after learning recommended to the company, so that the interview process to find a job later can save a lot of things.
The above is my opinion, because I do not understand your situation, so only about the introduction is not detailed, if you have other want to consult, you can always contact me for communication.
I said I'd be there by 1:00, I saw it all in the app
What do you mean by

The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you rise to the challenge, the problem will eventually be solved.
Chinese and Saudi curators join hands to organize the first Saudi Biennial of Contemporary Art-Xinhua
Riyadh, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennial, the Diriyah Biennial of Contemporary Art, was officially opened to the public on Dec. 11 at the JAX Art District in Diriyah, northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating.
The Biennale is co-curated by the Saudi Dirieh Biennale Foundation and UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, China, with Tian Feiyu, Director of UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, China, as Artistic Director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of the Biennale is "Crossing the River by Touching the Stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of socio-economic transition, and reflects the current situation of Saudi social and cultural development.
The Biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with exhibition halls spanning six interconnected buildings and presented in six units: "Crossing the River by Touching the Stone", "Heritage as Experiment", "Thinking on the Edge", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including painting, installation art and performance art, etc. The works of 12 Chinese artists are also of great interest, some of them using recycled materials in novel ways, such as Xu Bing's "The Story Behind Series - Endless Pictures of Streams and Mountains" (2014), in which he reconstructs a classic landscape painting.
Barkley, CEO of the Dirieh Biennale Foundation, said he hoped the Biennale would establish an international dialogue and give global audiences the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industries and creative community and strengthen interaction.
Tian Feiyu said: "The goal of the Biennale is twofold, to engage Saudi contemporary art in a global dialogue and to integrate Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art. "
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening week of the Biennale, in which artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: coordinate and standardize the management of rural public service positions-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, Dec. 12 (Xinhua Lin Bifeng), in order to continue to do a good job to help the population out of poverty, consolidate and expand the results of poverty eradication, Yunnan Province recently introduced to promote rural revitalization of rural public service jobs management-related policies to help promote the overall revitalization of rural areas.
The person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security introduced that, at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public service jobs for the placement of rural disadvantaged groups such as laborers out of poverty, which play an important role in helping people out of poverty to realize employment and increase income, consolidate the results of poverty eradication and effectively improve the capacity of various public services in the countryside.
This new regulation is jointly issued by seven departments of Yunnan Human Resources, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, mainly to unify the scope of the object, fund management, job development, and job management for grassroots recruitment of rural public service posters.
In the development and setting of jobs, the new rules clearly, in accordance with the "post according to need, to post, dynamic management, total control" " who develops, who uses, who is responsible for" and "one person, one post, voluntary public, unified management "the principle of setting.
Recruitment procedures must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, public announcement, employment, pre-service training and arrangement of induction.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public service jobs, rural public service jobs subsidy standards and subsidies, stipulate that the development departments of rural public service jobs should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for rural public service jobs; require the relevant departments to regularly monitor the issuance of rural public service jobs subsidies.

Hello
Can you cancel your order?

Second, although the right wing in the history of the era of ambition, but not for a long time, so short because to some sunshine will be brilliant, drink some boiling water will sweat; a little ambition will have to look forward to Shu, by the blow will be hair will not be attached.
But realistically speaking, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the Right should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy and improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of the administration and the guarantee of human rights.
Third, for my part, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about what he says and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is serious about China's social problems.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-communist revolution is necessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, mixed political groups, and foreign countries taking advantage of the situation.
Fourth, change or improve China to have patience and responsible attitude for the country and the people, political speculation attempts to take the chestnuts in the fire, that is not the right, is an asshole.
Talk about left again.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's words and analyze their ideas when needed, then the left has no such creation, because what the left wants is exactly the dregs that the Communist Party throws away!
Five, recently saw some friends dislike the anti-thief while refuting the left epilepsy, but also quite moving real gas, I think it is not necessary.
With traitors and left epilepsy do not try to reason, are a tendon, no reasoning.
And don't try to prove that we are right, let alone think about getting the rebels and left epilepsy to admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this: when the rebels call you fifty cents, when the left epileptic calls you a right dog, it just proves that this middle way of ours is the right one!
Many people have ideals when they are teenagers, but when they get older, they forget them, or pursue them, but they fall into paranoia.
And the ideal drifted away, and even the dragon slayer boy eventually became the evil dragon.
Left and right I think generally refers to restraint and freedom, China's innate genes from history and culture lead to China as a whole should be on the left.
While the domestic right is liberal and focused on efficiency and development, the left is more regulated and more focused on equity as well as security.
Now society in general wants to focus more on fairness, while China and the United States are fighting each other, the left side is certain, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although you can't read it, just like it and be done with it
Nothing to say, the flower is so righteous
In the past two years, the U.S. Empire's blockade and siege of Huawei chips, not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also let the "U.S. system" enterprises suffered huge losses.
The U.S. empire suppressed China's chip industry, requiring its own enterprises and allied countries related enterprises at the same time to block China's chip industry, a direct consequence is that the global chip suppliers' orders and profits are affected, resulting in lower investment in research and development and lower production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing a disruption of the shortage of chip supply chain worldwide.
Now the "lack of core" has spread to all major industries around the world, such as car companies to stop production, cell phone prices, almost all the industries that use chips are deeply affected by it.
In order to master the "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' technology giants began to go to the road of "de-glorification".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control, hold the development of China's semiconductor industry, the old U.S. action a lot recently, and host the "chip summit"; and invited 64 countries to set up a semiconductor alliance, and pull money to support the U.S. domestic technology giants, for example, the U.S. empire's old technology giant Intel in order to regain the dominant position in the chip field For example, in order to regain the dominant position in the field of chips, Intel spent $ 20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, the United States, and open up the chip foundry business to the public.
When most people thought that Intel's move will cause some impact on TSMC, and is likely to take away TSMC's "rice bowl".
The reason why so sure, because, Intel as the old American empire technology giant, in the field of semiconductor deep decades, has a large number of talent team and technology reserves, will be able to quickly rise in the short term to defeat TSMC.
However, for this decision of Intel, TSMC founder Chang Chung-Mou disdained it.
In the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising statement about Intel's move to spend money on building fabs, Zhang Zhongmou had no qualms about saying: Intel built a chip foundry, quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou is still haunted by a feud between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has been the pearl in the manufacturing industry of the U.S. Empire, majestically occupying the position of the global pinnacle, the world's dominant semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been in the hands of a few powerful players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, where chips were designed, manufactured and packaged by a single factory, and Intel was a representative of that era.
However, such a model makes some small enterprises overwhelmed, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only face huge production line construction costs can only be discouraged.
Inspired by market demand, the chip industry began to see a division of labor and cooperation after the 1980s. In 1984, when Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, he thought that since there were those specializing in design, he could set up a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Chang's vision became a reality and TSMC was born.
TSMC's main business is aimed at the single link of "wafer processing", which does not design but only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
At that time, TSMC was just created, in front of Intel, the giant is a minion.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had sought investment from Intel, but at that time, once Intel heard that TSMC was only doing the manufacturing part of the chip industry, it was obvious that some of them thought highly of themselves and looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel was looking down on the wafer fabrication service at that time.
I did not expect to look down on the wafer manufacturing services giant, but now also to start doing wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou finds it ironic that Intel has entered the foundry.
Today TSMC's market capitalization has surpassed that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally does not dare to stand still.
Today, TSMC has sprinted toward 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm 7 years ago.
Trying to catch up is actually not an easy task.
No more waiting

Look at some [strange hot searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three randomly selected hot searches: February 2 Dragon Head Raising, Holliday Price Increase, and Cargo Lala Incident, with public opinion spreading to form a wave, and then [exponential decline] (smooth curve) eventually dissipating, with a small hump reappearing if secondary public opinion is generated.
They look similar to the [model of online public opinion evolution] once shown on the official website of the Internet Information Office.
What is an unusual public opinion?
Six hot searches from the same event were randomly selected, showing [lonely peak shape], [jagged shape], and [cliff shape].
[Lone peak-like] that is artificially heated, quickly rush the list of hot search, to attract public attention; [jagged] that is periodically heated, to ensure that the topic is coiled in the list of hot search; [cliff-like] that is the collective withdrawal, the hot search play a "function", received a new task, rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat of one event is exactly the trough of another event, the time is not a minute difference, must be a unified group of water army received the task to start a new round of attack.
The specialization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for science, which lead to war to create momentum, which divert attention, which influence perception, which mislead judgment, which incite emotion, which hostage decision-making, black production accounts in batches, sub-nodes of refined combat, taking into account almost all elements of the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science, leaving aside all the subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black PR will also have nowhere to hide.
All walks must leave traces, such traces, we dig out together.

According to Mao Health Minister Kailash Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on November 27 from South Africa; another infected person is a local Mauritian resident who tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30 after coming into contact with a person who had recently returned from a trip to South Africa.
After isolation and treatment at the hospital, both infected individuals turned negative for nucleic acid and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that three cases of infection with the Omicron strain were confirmed for the first time in the country.
All three are students and returned from a trip abroad earlier this month and were not admitted to hospital as they were all mildly ill.

Your rider told me that the address was too far away
Dami 360 Integrated Home Decoration
Address: 12/F, Happy Home, No. 156, South Huancheng Road
At first, I was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to look at the initial budget of 70,000 to do a basic renovation.
Come to the store and start a series of scams.
I was the first time to the store just to show them my floor plan, they did not go to the field to measure the house, they can actually give me a quote that my 135 house 70,000 can be done, probably showed me their materials and do not know what brand of materials they are.
Their second scam is that you just arrive at the store will drag you to pay the deposit (and once this money is paid you are never refunded unless you have enough experience and they fight theoretical battles).
When I was hesitant to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to come and tell you how much of a discount we can give you if you just put the deposit down today.
This is a big pit, I am a living example of being cheated, in the impulse of the mind, paid a deposit of more than 10,000.
He gave me a quote with many problems 70,000 does not include plumbing and electrical remodeling, does not include any doors and cabinets bathrooms, and these three are the bulk of the cost of the base installation.
In addition to these, their service point fees are higher than those of other companies.
I lost my trust in this company and was told to sign the contract without any clear explanation at the beginning.
When I went to them for a refund they acted like they were very experienced and had a small team dedicated to dealing with you.
In any case, they will bite the bullet and say that it is the customer's problem and they are not responsible for it.
A variety of shirking responsibility, there are many details, do not want to say one by one are tears, in short, do not choose them, because my friend to find them to renovate the house is also the quality is not good, the late to you to calculate various costs.
Pitfall, they are the original fraudulent leading decorations, now changed to the great beauty, as if it collapsed again and changed to other.
So don't choose such a pitiful renovation company.
In the future, everyone in the choice of more Baidu look at these check these consultations because the renovation is not a small amount of money.

The starry sky has an appointment丨The Geminid meteor shower on the 14th to celebrate the great - Xinhua
Tianjin, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- As the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will be extremely large on Dec. 14, and friends who like meteor showers can observe it at midnight on that day.
Geminid meteor shower taken by Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anjiu in Qinghai on Dec. 13, 2018.
Most meteor showers have a periodic comet as their parent body, but the Geminid meteor shower has the parent body of the 3200 asteroid Fahrenheit, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that was not "birthed" by a comet.
Tianjin Astronomical Society director, astronomical science expert Xiu Lipeng said, like the New Year's blockbuster, Geminid meteor shower generally appear at the end of the year, "the release schedule" can last from December 4 to 17.
This meteor shower is known for its high and steady flow, and together with the Quadrantid meteor shower and Perseid meteor shower, it is known as one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
A distinctive feature of the Geminid meteor shower is the slow speed of the meteoroids, their rich colors, and the number of fire meteors, making it suitable for both visual inspection and for beginner astrophotographers.
Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jingjing photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on Dec. 13, 2020.
The astronomical forecast shows that this year's Geminid meteor shower will reach its maximum at around 15:00 on December 14, with a ZHR (the number of meteors visible per hour when the radiation point is directly overhead under ideal observation conditions) of 150.
Geminid meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the Geminid meteor shower was very impressive, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, so the excitement will be a little less.
The 14th is the eleventh day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar, the phase of the moon is the surplus-convex moon, the bright moonlight will interfere with the observation, it is good that the moon will set in the second half of the night, and the radiation point of the Geminid meteor shower will rise higher at this time.
Those who like meteor showers can observe during these hours after the moon in the second half of the night, but be careful to protect yourself from the cold and keep warm . "
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, but in the suburbs or the countryside, choose a place with a high elevation, little light damage and an open view facing northeast, then patiently wait until the moon sets and observe it visually.
It is important to note that the Geminid meteor shower has a high flow in all directions, so you do not need to keep your eyes on the radiant of the Geminid meteor shower when observing.
For those who like photography to shoot a gorgeous 'meteor shower', it is best to choose a wide-angle, large aperture lens and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and sustainability considerations, tripods, spare batteries and shutter cables are also essential. "
Xiu Lipeng cautioned.
What is the difference in market positioning between laser TV and traditional TV?
To my understanding, the traditional TV that the subject refers to should refer to LCD TVs, and the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and LCD TVs are mainly the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared to the LCD TV full spread of market positioning, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product born for the large screen.
At present, the mainstream LCD TV size more than 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of the laser TV is generally more than 75 inches, the largest more than 100 inches, fully meet the needs of users of large screen color TV.
In recent years, laser TV shipments and sales in the global share are increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the overall TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to CEC's forecast, in 2020, laser TV market sales will grow by more than 140%, continuing to maintain high growth.
The reason for such good results in the large-screen market is mainly attributed to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TV, the light emitted from the laser light source is not directly into the eye, compared to the backlighting of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation of the eyes is also smaller.
China Electronics Technology Standardization Institute Saisi laboratory and Beijing Union Hospital ophthalmology experts, through the crowd under the same conditions to watch the laser TV and LCD TV rigorous comparison test, resulting in 144 sets of test data.
The data confirms: laser TV does have strong eye protection properties and even has some improvement in specific aspects.
At a time when vision health is becoming more and more important, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with its eye-care advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, the laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the LCD TV prices continue to dip, the current price of commercially available laser TVs are mostly above 10,000 yuan, with the size and light source upgrades, the price gradually climbed.
What makes a laser TV so expensive to sell?
It must make sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technology level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection can't achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter compared to traditional projection equipment, and can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, requiring little space, and the host is small, taking up very little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
Plus lower heat generation, less wear and tear on equipment, and longer TV life.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with true 4K ultra-high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, bionic screen and many other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more stunning audio-visual experience.
Talk about pseudo-demand, but the product of demand segmentation, on the picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not the dish of audio-visual players, want to take into account the large screen and the lack of viewing environment, you can try, there are pros and cons of everything, after weighing their own judgment can be, afraid to listen to one side of the story.
Simply put, ultra wide-angle near-focus projectors - laser TVs - have to use expensive ultra wide-angle lenses and mirrors in order to fit close to the curtain, which is not optically optimal design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of micro-structured Fresnel curtains, costly, 80-inch price can basically replace a 65-inch LCD.
One more thing, I especially hate projection manufacturers to take diffuse reflection on the eyes as a selling point, come on, the eyes can see the light on the curtain for the eyes is direct light, you diffuse reflection to the ceiling, the eyes can not see, have to be serious LCD TV is also diffuse "direct", turn on the TV ceiling is not also illuminated?
Moreover, the projection curtain, if not diffuse reflection, simply can not become like.
Just ignored the high gain curtain hot spot (light spot) effect, a certain angle of a large number of light reflected to the eye, that is really hard to bear.

[Service] Very enthusiastic and attentive.
The stylist was quite patient.
The photographer will also be very careful to teach you the action.
Not satisfied, the photographer will also offer to make up the shot.

The end of the eyebrows were also shaved, which is a bit embarrassing for the daily non-drawn eyebrows.

Is it reliable to buy insurance with a small umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an Internet-based insurance brokerage platform.
From the set-up conditions: according to the "Insurance Brokerage Institutions Supervision Regulations (2015 Revision)" tips, to become an insurance brokerage company, you must meet three key words: shareholders, the promoters of the last three years without major illegal records, the minimum limit of RMB 50 million to be established, and must be agreed by the CIRC.
These three articles are actually very harsh, summed up is to have the strength, to be approved by the national authority of the CBIRC (regulation of insurance companies and banks within the country), shareholders should have good style, as an insurance brokerage company of the small umbrella insurance, the insured is not too much to question the small umbrella insurance is formal or not, after all, there are these 3 thresholds, not what insurance companies can reach.
At this point, it's not bad and is trustworthy.
From the insurance products: small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest shelves of Hetai Super Mary 5 critical illness insurance, the claimant and underwriter are Hetai Life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, do not need to question its reliability.
From the point of view of payment mode: Internet platform products, because of less operating costs of business outlets, and the cost of salesmen's wages, so the Internet products are generally more cost-effective, and the payment mode is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the pressure of the policyholder's payment, and at the same time can maximize the leveraging of insurance.
This is still a very good point.
It can be considered.
From the point of view of the professionalism of the salesman: this is particularly important, because insurance is an industry with very strong requirements for professionalism, many Internet products customers can insure themselves, this will be a lot of misunderstandings, in the health information and occupation of this section, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when taking out insurance, think they are healthy or in line, so there are easy to have a lot of claims hidden risks, there may be The risk of denial of claims.
I have done insurance telemarketing for Tencent Micro Insurance (an Internet insurance brokerage platform like Little Umbrella) and I can tell you very responsibly.
Internet insurance is true and reliable, not reliable is the person, the Internet channel does not have a professional practitioner, there are also a lot of sales misleading.
For example: 1 yuan insurance coverage of 6 million, buy insurance to send cell phones, free to receive 60,000 critical illness coverage, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but avoid the important, but will not tell the insured, the first month of 1 yuan, the next month is the need for normal charges, ranging from a few dozen to 200, many customers deducted a couple of years to buy their own is a what is not clear.
Thought you could spend $1 and the insurance company would pay $6 million (the world fell into place).
Free cell phone, is the policy tail number such as 6666, 8888 such a special policy number to send, and if the winning SMS sent, you do not redeem, and no one reminded.
(This is another pit for the insured) free to receive 60,000 critical illness coverage, is a short-term, if only rely on this, no other commercial insurance, in case of a real serious illness, 60,000 can do, can not solve the problem, the future of life began to run naked.
The state is also currently cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales.
So all in all, the platform is no problem, the product is no problem, there is a problem is the professionalism and professional conduct of the salesman.
It is recommended that the subject comprehensive and careful consideration, in fact, many offline insurance brokers have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products are better than the Internet products in terms of cost performance.
I myself have helped 59 Internet clients, underwriting offline products, save $2,000-3,000/year each on premiums.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I: Ming Ya insurance broker, have 3 years of experience in corporate management training, served nearly 1,000 corporate users, cooperation with more than 100 insurance companies, before the insurance, I will start from the customer needs, customized insurance products for customers, in the insurance, for customers to compare three, try to get the best underwriting results for customers, after the insurance, for customers to do policy collation, policy trust, so that customers do not worry.
Lifelong growth with each client.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulator, Internet insurance is an insurance business where the policyholder can complete all the insurance process independently after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign and the insurance advisor does not need to sign, all the steps can be done by the policyholder himself.
Although Internet insurance is not too "ritualistic", and there may not even be a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model, somewhat similar to the general "telemarketing" assembly line operation, but so the purchase of insurance will also have a fatal problem, that is - the follow-up service may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, should we not seriously consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" that will be with us for a long time and will provide services to us even after many years? Is it an "insurance intermediary" that will be with us for a long time and will provide us with services for many years?

No problem, remember not to arrange a resend, I have purchased another, do not want to waste
Thank you for your help
From before to now, I am against any kind of slander and abuse, not to mention the unacceptable behavior of such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but it is this kind of villain that must be eliminated.
If we don't look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized style that we have to resist first.
From the time you started sending Facebook friend requests, to the flirtatious posts, to your attempts to post my alleged home location and father's name on social media, I have taken a hands-off approach.
After that, you not only continued to tag me as often as six meals a day, but you also continued to discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook about me with implied, humiliating comments about my looks, body, good breeding, and what to grow strawberries on the bed, and whether to penetrate or not, I... And forget it.
But then I received a number of messages from friends about your Facebook friend account posting a picture of you and comments of sexual harassment.
Sorry, but as a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
After the news that I called the police was uploaded, you did not restrain yourself at all, but became more and more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is, or what your status is, in our society, there is a need for respect from both genders.
Yes, you can continue the flirtatious, subtle, humiliating, abusive comments, you can continue to say that you are just caring and concerned, you can continue to argue that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that you made the picture or continue to make all the offensive comments.
That's right, I can't, and I don't have the power to stop you.
I neither know you, nor do I want to know you, and I don't need you to comment on my looks and body.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to let someone humiliate her so much in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me if I was okay.
You wouldn't believe me if I said yes.
I don't think there would be any girl who could say she was okay after being bullied like that.
Whether at work, in society, in politics or in business, only those who lack even basic character would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the eye of the beholder.
I have cut off some of the messages for your comments
Your own posting should not be able to impersonate you
I can only say that you are the public enemy of civilization
A smile from the heart

U.S. Three Aircraft Carriers Rally Around China Most Powerful Weapons Make Rare Visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Dovetail Pro-CCP Media Dovetail Report: The latest news on U.S.-China relations: The latest satellite images show that three U.S. aircraft carriers are massing around China; U.S. media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, releasing important signals to U.S. allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform, a Chinese think tank, a satellite spotted the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier in the vicinity of the Balabac Strait on Jan. 9.
The Balabac Strait, which connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic point in the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects the Carl Vinson to deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the carrier USS Carl Vinson with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Fish Hawk carrier transport aircraft.
The U.S. carriers now cruising in the Pacific, in addition to the USS Carl Vinson, are the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on Jan. 3.
"For the first time, the USS Lincoln also carries a squadron of F-35Cs, which is part of the U.S. Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron.
In addition to the two carriers mentioned above, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the guided missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain and the guided missile destroyer USS Stokdal.
Three U.S. Aircraft Carriers Rally Around China, Most Powerful Weapons Make Rare Visit to Guam On January 17, 2022, the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform released the latest satellite images showing three U.S. aircraft carriers gathering around China.
(Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather around China's most powerful weapons in a rare visit to Guam Jan. 17, 2022, flight path of U.S. naval transport aircraft CMV-22B.
(Weibo @SouthChina Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) Another CNN report on Jan. 17 said that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. Naval Base Guam on Saturday (Jan. 15).
Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather around China in a rare visit to Guam with the most powerful weapons Analysis says this is a signal to allies and foes in the increasingly tense Indo-Pacific region.
It was the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
Three U.S. Aircraft Carriers Rally Around China, Most Powerful Weapons Make Rare Visit to Guam China has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China's Yongxia Island in the Spratly Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) In a statement, the U.S. Navy said the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada's visit to Guam strengthens cooperation between the U.S. and its allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, readiness and ongoing commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 Thunder Submarines in the U.S. Navy fleet are normally kept strictly confidential.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the Thunder Submarine "the most important survivable weapon of the nuclear trinity," a system that also includes silo ballistic missiles located on the U.S. mainland and bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
I was talking to a friend about Meta's recent 26% plunge and $251 billion market cap evaporation, and Zuckerberg's response of "facing unprecedented competition".
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with revenue coming mainly from advertising, and today's money-making advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc. are all traffic channels for Meta, regardless of their functional positioning.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising affiliate", many apps are connected to Meta's ads and realize the cash through Meta's advertising platform.
But times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get the data information of users, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's privacy policy is now user-friendly and will clearly prompt the user whether or not to allow the App to access their information, and most people's normal reaction must be no.
The next stab from Google would have a much bigger impact on Meta's revenue.
Second, the China factor, which used to be a part of Meta's revenue growth, has also weakened (it's not certain how much of a factor it is, but it is there).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this is not an accurate understanding.
Each year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from companies in China that do business overseas.
Meta has about a few hundred people in its Hong Kong office and several major agents in mainland China.
Meta is the advertising channel that Chinese companies want to expand overseas, and most of the money they burn goes to Meta.
Interestingly, byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from byte in the first two years.
Various domestic agents are helping Bytes to advertise with Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't been specifically looking into it recently, but it's certainly no better than before.
The phase of Chinese companies burning money on a large scale overseas is over.
Third, new traffic channels are not expanding smoothly.
Facebook is getting old, and the newer platforms, including TT, are out of Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in revenue, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only looking at revenue, but also at what the future expectations are.
Obviously, Meta's expectations were not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the "meta-universe" .
Meta-universe should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of meta-universe is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market cap in these two or three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook is now very scenic, also has 100 billion to 200 billion U.S. dollars in revenue each year, in fact, Facebook is now a very strong sense of crisis, compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good security moat.
Although several of his social software is now a relatively high daily activity, but also the mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but the face of tiktok's rapid development, Facebook also has little confidence, subversion between the blink of an eye.
And engage in the meta-universe this unattainable concept, a short period of time there is absolutely no hope of success, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg and change the name of the company, and constantly looking for a new track the fundamental reason, but I think his track choice is wrong, is a road of no return The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
