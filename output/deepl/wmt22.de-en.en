The goods cost under 20 euros.
The fee is equal to 40% of the value of goods test....
I am #PRS_ORG# major customer so it is not a problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction on what to include with the package so it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago.... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way to get credit?
I also think in principle that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Sometimes a quick look, sometimes a quick help, sometimes bringing the bottle, etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help out in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough of a child themselves, I don't see a problem there.
If your K1 is keeping busy on his own for the short time and it's OK for him, that's fine.
You are the best judge of whether this is a good fit for your kids.
It's not like he's supposed to swaddle K2 and spend hours helping him fall asleep.
From a purely legal standpoint, it's probably questionable.
Maybe that's where the psychologist's statement comes from.
Because if something should actually happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Now whether that's a risk you want to take is, of course, up to your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember a few years ago a crime / thriller to have read and I can remember almost the entire plot but I want the title partout no longer remember maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by pouring food on himself and going to join his felines in the enclosure.
The case is taken over by a detective who, after a short investigation, comes across his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before each suicide to go to the place of the suicide and document it and put the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where the patients are transplanted a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and the patients eventually face their fear in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out of the window another drives herself to death on purpose)
This facing of fear is called "the fight" in the book.
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That's the rough plot I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author.
If this plot is known to anyone or even if someone can tell me the title of the book I would be very happy.
Oh dear, I don't have the wifi password available.
Must contact my husband first.
But that can take time.
What steps do I need to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded ?

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Due to the combination of digital decoder and sound module on one PCB, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any locomotive of the gauges H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" speaker along with a sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It masters the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders register fully automatically with a suitable digital control center.
It handles all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values on the main track can be read out with suitable command stations.
Auxiliary registers exist for control panels that can only program CVs from 1-255.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed levels at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode makes reprogramming possible even with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration with mfx®-compatible command stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes Märklin® braking sections as well as ZIMO® HLU braking commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake modules or with DC voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also stops with a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC automatic shuttle train system enables automatic shuttling between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC railroads.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to push booster vaccination
New omicron cases continue to worry policymakers and scientists in the UK.
Therefore, by New Year's Day, all qualifying adults in England should receive an offer of vaccination.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress on Corona booster vaccinations than previously targeted in the face of rapidly rising Omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should already be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said Sunday night in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen.
Previously, the target date was the end of January.
The UK government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, he said.
One is facing an emergency in the face of the Omikron variant, so there is an urgent need to strengthen vaccination protection, Johnson said.
The good news, he said, is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
"Get boosted now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the United Kingdom, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
is the full amount refunded from the purchase price at pickup?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I sent off an application.
Today the invitation for an interview came by mail.
I want to respond to the email.
But unfortunately the name is not a "Peter", but a more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I am a foreigner and I don't want to step over the feet of an official.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
Have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today does not work
Obviously, the chair had a defect not apparent at sale.
How can such a pad damage occur after 9 months otherwise ?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working for approx.
14 days no more.
So I've always bought the last few books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to please add 2 chairs to the order and charge me for it.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I'm going to write something a little detailed about domestic violence here.
I just have to get something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more frequently for professional reasons.
One issue that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims don't let us help them or think we can't help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I can't do anything about these situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes....
But even talking in private, with the perpetrator far out of sight and earshot, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it is fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of snatching the children from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, partly very close to tears myself, all are worth to be able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to just accept violence.
Often I wish I could help with this in every case.... I know that I can't.
But it never makes it easier.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What's the series on "League of Legends" worth?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, a stunning presentation: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby debacle of MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster Johannes Patrick could be relied upon.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said, looking back on the cup defeat at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim in early October, "We still have some anger in our bellies."
However, this did not subside after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Whereby even more than the naked result, the manner of the performance was disappointing.
As a representative example, here is a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-goal quota was just 13 percent, 4 goals (all from young Johannes Patrick) on no less than 31 attempts - any questions?
The answer was provided by John Patrick: "We just weren't focused enough after the win at Tenerife, and didn't implement what we trained for."
Namely, to move the ball.
His opposite number Sebastian Gleim had a completely different reaction: "An awesome game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like we were in front of 10,000 people".
Only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and directed the game of his team.
"The best playmaker I've ever coached," Gleim still praised.
While in Patrick's team even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the Giants avoided a total debacle and came within eight points after they had already trailed 39:59.
Besides Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to complain.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg maximally 750 spectators.
we used to have a different email address, but i changed it.
Yes, I already signed up a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We checked again legally and wrote to them again about it.
We originally signed up six months ago.
Always as good as new: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - when he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday this Sunday on stage in Leipzig.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "on official orders" to contain the Corona virus.
Other of his performances planned for Advent will also have to be cancelled for now, according to the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists then want to make up for their dates already postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe enjoyed singing as a youngster.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has received many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - reached second place in the charts.
It has made it out of the niche and into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, his blond hair combed back tightly and careful about etiquette, Max Raabe is an indispensable part of the current German-language music landscape.
He has been on tour with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" since 2020. dpa

Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing
The new Federal Minister for Building, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants peace of mind that their rent will remain affordable for years to come.
Incidentally, a diverse mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
But if the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in particular in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will talk to the Attorney General to get that implemented as soon as possible.
If the rental market still does not ease, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
Numerous tornadoes passed through the U.S. in a devastating storm system.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths.
The images from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
In the night to Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the USA and possibly claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms left a trail of devastation some 320 kilometers long, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area, everywhere the tornado ripped through was gone.
Houses, stores, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that's even possible.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, with official numbers rising by the hour.
Hello, I just saw that they showcase #NAME# is sold out.
That is a great pity.
Is it still in production?
Or is it out of the range altogether?
Is there a possibility to order this showcase in another country?
until when do you report?
If the delivery can not be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order !
I understand that, just can I order the blanket now and have it shipped to Germany that is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an item via the contact form and wanted to ask if it was received or processed, because I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees cash premiums for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
Transforming advertising slogans into calls for vaccination - based on the German model - is also expected to increase willingness to receive Corona vaccinations.
He moved to a company he was bitching about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and see.
It's been a year.
Obviously, he has not sewn himself into his old place and has looked for something else.
You may.
And that he didn't like you back then: well never mind.
After all, he didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please record the cancellation.
This will then be legally relevant.
I'm making a screen shot.

Help with first own campaign
Greetings to Boron!
I am currently running the adventure Over the Griffin's Pass for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out, and now I'm in the process of writing the introductory adventure and tripping over my own feet at the very first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to take a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There the further action shall develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is said to ambush the heroes.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in a variety of ways: Persuading, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early, whatever comes to the players' minds.
Group strength: 8 common goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
If they don't notice, the goblins lie in wait for the heroes in a hollow way and flank the carriage with three on the left and three on the right, armed with bows, while two stop the carriage with spears.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two possible solutions
1. the heroes are all unconscious and subsequently found and healed by the son of the village schoolman, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
If defeat is inevitable, this half-elf will intervene with two of his servants and come to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina is from Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a decisive role later on, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now I have more confidence in my narratives again.
I disassembled the lamp again.
And put back together again.
Unfortunately, it still does not work.
That is why I would still like to send them back
Can you then send the returns to come, then I can pack the lamp and bring to #PRS_ORG#.

I am annoyed with Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to vent a little with this post.
First of all, today the broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race to let the F1 pre-reporting start on time.
Although the delayed start and the start accident meant that the schedule was far behind schedule, it would still have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, F1 has priority for legal reasons and therefore everything else has to be limited, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then there was in the F1 once again ignorance of the rules with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that one may change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation has already occurred at Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen should be allowed to change tires when there were corresponding radio messages on the subject to Hamilton.
On Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators knew immediately that this possibility existed for Verstappen.
In my opinion, you should simply know such elementary rules if you commentate on F1 at a pay TV station.
It is also not the first guessing game as to what is now possible or mandatory according to the rules, both just have constant uncertainties on the subject of rules.
In general, I don't like Roos' stilted commentary style, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I seriously like even Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant sillinesses that make both of them seem simply unprofessional, like ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter totally brings a lot of trouble into the commentary, which he obviously does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply gets out of hand on Sky, in the final lap Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV since only the German audio track has to get by without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two stations also do less advertising in the training sessions than Sky, and that's as a free TV station.
While you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone doesn't let me overlook the drawbacks.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programming is also very poor and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language channel broadcasting F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, except for the advertising.
In any case, this makes the grandiose F1 season much less fun than it would be with a decent channel.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On this one: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday she would check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
Fan pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via airlift.
This series is offered by us in 3 variants.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the performance in comparison.
If the pumps are powerful enough, you can run entire plants with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that you can connect several outlets.
MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model fan pump also offer to set an accent in the aquarium, for example, with an air curtain (you can find in our store) or with a decor, which convert the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or the like.
The MK series has a special sound-insulated design, ensuring low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an air outlet or similar by means of a 4/6 mm air hose...and you're ready to go.
The fan pump should be equal to, or higher than, the water level and should be placed outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent, once water would run backwards, that the water from the basin runs through the pump....
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, just like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even though here in ebay we state the processing time as 3 days, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up here daily.
If everything goes well on the road, it goes very quickly.
We just want to prevent a little bit, so that nobody is disgruntled just because it took a little longer once.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding of all the employees who also work in freight forwarding...of course here no Corona stops.
Please do not immediately rate badly just because the delivery is delayed, this is entirely due to the parcel services.
People like to rant about these services, of course, even though right now we're saying...they're having a hell of a time
This also varies greatly from region to region.
Do not be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
how long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?
Kannt one here also order the legs in light?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first U.S. American in space, a TV host and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' company Blue Origin.
Takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the western part of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos himself welcomed the newly crowned astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue spacesuit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Amid applause from friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were en route for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space as a Nasa astronaut in 1961 and after whom Blue Origin's rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were the company's guests of honor; the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they each paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He said he had to work hard during his assignments and do everything himself.
She was just along for the ride, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would love to go back into space right now, the presenter said.
"New Shepard" flies up to an altitude of 100 kilometers
The "New Shepard" missile system flies largely automated.
The capsule, which separated from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the earth, at times with weightlessness, before the reusable object landed again braked by large parachutes.
The International Aeronautical Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth to be the limit to outer space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin's third manned space flight: On the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former U.S. pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October featured 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin deputy chief Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the good of humanity and without regard for the climate.
At the touch of a button, you can easily select whether your "Smart Stone" should shine permanently in one color or play through its entire color repertoire.
Set to color change, the light stone maintains one light color for about a minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative hue.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" luminaire proves itself outdoors all year round.
In snowy surroundings, their light even does particularly well - only shortened light duration is to be expected as soon as the days turn out shorter.
In winter, please only make sure that no snow interferes with the solar module's function.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the common Mignon ("AA") format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.
You can purchase a suitable replacement battery from our webshop to further extend the useful life of your deco light.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting and standing in the lab doesn't bother me either (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry internship).
Of course, I informed myself about career prospects before I started my studies, but at that time I still thought that I would definitely like to study up to my doctorate.
At the moment, however, doubts come to me, especially depressing me the career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc.) one hears again and again super career opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other hand one hears again and again of unemployed biologists and incredibly badly paid jobs.
That's why I'd be really interested to know:
1) What are you currently working as?
2) Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
3) What did you study/what training did you do?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you very much for your answers!
I'm really unsure at the moment and am thinking about possibly dropping out of my studies in 2022 and training to become an IT specialist.
If you have experience there write the also gladly times :)
Extra stress before vacations & vacation weekends
This topic came up for me last week.
But I now had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why only now a post about it.
It's not just before big vacations, like the Christmas vacations, that there's a lot of stress at our company.
It seems that it is also available before public holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was Assumption Day, which is called "Ascension Day" in Switzerland.
On Friday, the vast majority of people and companies take a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what went last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of e-mails that absolutely had to go out before Ascension Day, orders here and there, all of which *had* to be done before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and it shouldn't be?
Or because people seriously want to accomplish as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed out on Wednesday, but I was also really annoyed.
What is this self-congratulation about holidays?
What is the point of having holidays if we are not allowed to enjoy them properly?!
Mind you, the stress didn't come from above, the colleagues were all in such a mood on their own.
My question is simple: Is it just us, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you also know this in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her home state of Thuringia - but doesn't have any presents yet.
"The nice thing, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you just go to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She said she will get in the mood for the holiday by baking cookies and making crafts with her son.
"I love that," Catterfeld said.
But she still has a lot to do before the festive season: "For the first time, I don't have any presents yet, so I have to get started now.
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of molting and new plumage formation.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of plumage damage that occurs in aviculture is due entirely to nutritional deficiencies.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, for the formation of a flawless plumage a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Much of the animal losses that occur during molting are due to inadequate or imbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft feed.
Thank you, I have found it
Unfortunately still does not work
GDR handmade model old building electric locomotive E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of Modelleisenbahner ME issue 11/1968, used with traces of play and missing parts see photos, function good, The class E 95 is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal block trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
One locomotive is in the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and is being refurbished for operation.
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be capable of hauling 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at 45 km/h cruising speed on this line.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
Between December 1927 and June 1928, six locomotives were delivered and given the road numbers E 95 01-06.
All of them survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
At the Reichsbahn repair facility in Dessau, all six locomotives were determined to be worthy of reconditioning.
[4] When the progressive re-electrification of the Central German network resulted in an increasing need for locomotives for heavy freight service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger numbers, were built first.
It was only when it became clear that the number of remanufactured E 94s could not be increased any further that the E 95s became the focus of remanufacturing.
[4]Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren depot.
They came to the Halle P depot in 1960.
They were used in a separate schedule mostly in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig, and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control system of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
Thus, it often happened that contactors got stuck during switching operations.
Then the mate, who was always riding on this locomotive, had to use a hammer and wooden wedge to loosen the contactors again while the locomotive was in motion.
Damage to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to months of locomotive downtime.
[5] Since there were enough new-build locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and with most of the splitter types, so that the E 95s were taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted electric locomotives to be manned only by one man, which would have resulted in a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn in mid-1969, they were followed by the E 95 01, which left service on October 5, 1970.
The intended new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a point heating system at Halle main station.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external refurbishment of the locomotive began with the goal of being able to present it at a vehicle show at the Dessau RAW.
[5] Since then, it belonged to the Dresden Museum of Transport as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the interior of the locomotive was completed.
The DB Museum in Halle (Saale) looks after the locomotive as a museum.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was able to be presented for the first time for an exhibition at the Arnstadt Museum-Bw with a new interior and exterior paint scheme, with the transformers checked and five traction motors operational.
-The locomotives were in service until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching branch lines, where they proved their worth thanks to their reliable propulsion and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the Central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handmade model H0 in OVP, function good, there are optical rework on the locomotive in self-work necessary, dusted, with traces of play, cellar smell !!!, very rare handmade model, very small edition- possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packages may have labels and traces of storage.
Yes the F parts are
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The center bar is held by two feet..unfortunately, they are too narrow and the bar cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can not build the bed.
The center bar is held by two feet, unfortunately, these are defectively produced.
The center bar does not fit in the intended holder.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent out?
no no flat.
These are, according to the assembly instructions the correct from the form, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing that they serve their purpose
With me they are not flat
Could I have these sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, do you want me to explain the problem again?
Residential house fire with two light injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range was caused, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital Sunday with minor smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not assume that the fire was set intentionally.
The Fürstenfeldbruck Criminal Investigation Department has taken over further investigations.
But then it arrives much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published on the social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not commented publicly on his vaccination status until now.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend had moved him to do so, Şahin informed.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was supposedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the network "LinkedIn" on Friday.
"For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he said, he has refused because the communication should not be about himself.
But a phone call last week changed his mind, he said, "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe Covid 19 disease and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The schoolmate and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin further wrote.
He did not ask why.
"The most common cause, however, appears to be fear, often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, he said, so sometimes it's better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet in which Uğur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself also clarified.
"I am currently not allowed by law to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
He said there is prioritization in Germany for vaccinating the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has long since been lifted - and the Biontech boss has had himself vaccinated three times, according to his own information.
Fire in transformer station: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
The lights went out in several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire caused severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia were left without electricity for around 24 hours.
The fire caused lights to go out for 41,000 affected residents in several communities Friday night.
The utility Westnetz reported that numerous emergency generators were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely eliminated late in the evening.
Firefighters and THW helpers provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The utility thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of primary technology, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will still take a few days, as the Westnetz fitters were initially only able to put some lines back into operation provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Current flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out at around 7:15 p.m. on Friday severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work would be necessary there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level had been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back on.
Since 6 p.m. on Saturday, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth would have had electricity again.
A further 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9.30 p.m. onwards.
As of 11:15 p.m., those most recently affected by the outage would also have electricity.
More than 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed.
Authorities had also appealed for neighborhood help after setting up an emergency power supply for key buildings at noon on Saturday.
"What is important now is for citizens to look out for elderly or single people in their neighborhoods and report to local fire stations when help is needed," said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When it came to setting up and operating emergency generators, the focus was primarily on residents of retirement homes.
In addition, according to officials, temporary care spaces were set up in schools for those people who could not care for themselves or who needed power-related medical equipment or were dependent on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the bedspread #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy ♡
But I can not mount the base on the table top.
It is Custom #NAME#.
Of these, there are 3 versions.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#.
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however I am unable to telescope them and thus shorten them.
Can you help me with this?
Otherwise I would have to send it back, because it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate feedback
yes that is really easier!
Then let's do it this way!
send me the return slip by mail?
the repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
However, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG# before purchasing it.
Is that what you want me to do now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with this
Nordic combined: Combined Riiber wins
The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to admit defeat once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a large lead after the ski jumping in the cross-country.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes we both have redone s and use the version 4.5...
It could be that you have heard of problems before.
Have directly with my #PRS_ORG#, bought a book it also seems to be on it.
As soon as I want to open it comes the message, oops!
This document could not be opened.
File may be incorrect contact customer service.
As far as I can tell it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me further?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I also have to work in between!
To ensure that the paint application is even and clean, you should clean the components with a little soapy water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clean water and dry.
Before you bring the brush onto the model for the first time with a new color, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the components, which will not be visible later, or on a yogurt pot.
The first stroke on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Slight overlapping of the paint layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid quick wiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates unrealistic looking surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones could otherwise show through later.
Metallic shades and colors come at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks can occur when they mix with normal paints.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you assemble them.
The models achieve a true-to-the-original appearance through the decals or decals.
From national emblems on airplanes to ship names to trim and license plates on car models: The decals give the model the final touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the parts are still easy to reach.
An airplane cockpit is easier to glue on before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a steady hand when gluing.
Cut out each decal you need individually and lay them out for yourself.
Decals are also called water decals because you wet their backside briefly with water until the backing paper darkens due to the wetness.
Then you push the picture only a small piece from the paper and put the piece on the appropriate place on the model (which you also moistened before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper off to the side.
Caution: Always check that the image is properly seated before you slide it completely off the paper so that it doesn't stick to your finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Vacuum off excess water with a household cloth.
Warning not suitable for children under 3 years
I can open a book only briefly, as soon as I look for something else then I no longer read the book and have to log out and log in and reload the book and look for the place until where I have read.
AM Saturday I have already communicated with you before.
Will I receive this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 separate packages with me
ok anyway thank you!
then i will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But can I get it back without any problem?
Infertility treatment with PKV / What is an "insured event"?
Hello all,
We have been undergoing fertility treatment for some time, and now when it comes to billing the PKV, they suddenly refuse to accept it.
In order:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the PKV and received the approval for 3 attempts.
The trials were not restricted in any way (e.g., time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and performed 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet bill PKV for them.
We again applied for cost coverage with the PKV and were again granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we made more attempts than promised, logically settle the most expensive with the PKV) we submitted the bills to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV wants to reimburse only 3 attempts.
Rationale: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second child wish was a new insurance case.
According to the GTC, however, "The insured event begins with the medical treatment and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions for the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (5 attempts are to be reimbursed)?
* Should the PKV have informed us in the promises that with a birth the further attempts expire?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance claim?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please email me the three variations and tell me how best to get back to them
All right.
We will not order anything from them again.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously lost good customer.
Feel free to pass that along to their manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague said to me that the refund has been arranged and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can not help it that the chest of drawers arrives completely disturbed with me
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written
It clearly states that the refund has been initiated and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#.
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not do that now.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they may not sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to procure another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and provide it to the shipping company that way.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#.
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we can not find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget movies
There is no general definition of what exactly a low-budget film is, with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say about it:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films on the web, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it?
And what do you maybe not like at all?
Am a very good customer of yours, have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for Odelle gray leather sofa.
The delivery time has now been extended once again, is this now also reliable?
Thanks a lot
With kind regards
Gibts there no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min, is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I give up then soon again times, because it just does not work here.

"Half victory" against Belarus comes at a high cost for the EU
The EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
But the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at "Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The researcher from the Berlin-based Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP) explained that the EU had not resolved the confrontation in a sustainable manner.
This state of limbo - Belarus does not quite give in, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while.
The treatment of people at the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong ruled.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments, he said.
Since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposed to this, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It obviously cannot prevail when a member state gets it in its head to do its thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border agency Frontex access to the border.
Moreover, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, Bossong said: a fundamental agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult because the "border protection, border protection, border protection" line has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
Meanwhile, according to Poland's border guards, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
Fifty-five migrants were detained Sunday night and returned to the border, an agency spokeswoman said Sunday.
The Polish officers were pelted with stones by the migrants during the incident not far from the village of Czeremsza, he said.
According to the information, one soldier was hit in the face and had to receive medical attention from a military doctor.
In total, the Border Guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had crossed the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, as the ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania sealed off sections of the border, according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to people's countries of origin to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"That's when the EU put its market power on the line and proved its determination to play hardball and use extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk would also have to consider domestic political costs.
Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly smuggles thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
Max Verstappen allegedly committed two rule violations during the race, according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule breaks at once in the last Grand Prix of the year.
One protest relates to an alleged infringement by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the final safety car period, when he is said to have overtaken in contravention of the rules.
A second appeal was filed against the scoring at the end of the race.
In Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed according to the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
Checking.
I will talk to the bank and get back to you.

Free entry for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg fan day
Europa-Park, the name giver for the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
According to the park, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausage.
The roller coaster trains shone that day through the jerseys red and white.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and lots of red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," the park said.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the amusement park in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 1990s.
The first SC Freiburg Fan Day at Europa-Park showed again how well the partnership fits.
Seeing beaming fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms that," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" at the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast, and listens sensitively for the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
I posted the contact form yesterday to return an item, but did not receive an email confirmation or anything.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your batty chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake you fix and not all from our household.
Contact Ms. #NAME#.
I can not chat with them every day
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would get an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a reorder of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return label.
This email has not come yet.
The package would like to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me
With kind regards

Sorry but just because he says he is not an anti-Semite means nothing.
This is like when an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it to their i.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it completely.
Yes wow then you are similarly little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Who seriously questions the evolution in principle is simply completely lost.
Because of me, a god set the whole thing in motion.
But as soon as you are a creationist you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and that science is only nonsense.
And with that you are an enemy of science and not to be taken further seriously like Kollegah
To obtain an optimal field of view, the loupe should be moved as close as possible to the eye.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic designed lens system allows you to use the loupe practically free of distortion and color errors up to the edge zone.
Often magnifiers are marked with magnification information.
However, these specifications apply only to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To get the most out of your loupe, please follow the instructions in the "Technical data" table (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including single-vision magnifiers.
An anti-reflective coating significantly reduces these reflections.
If the optimum conditions of use are observed - magnifier close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less perceptible.
Further instructions can be found in the enclosed operating instructions (available in German and English).

Fir sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz women select the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many a curious situation when selling fir trees.
Once, a man is said to have even returned home without his partner because the two could not come to an agreement.
Every year he plants for it a good 2000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many a curious situation.
That always makes the run-up to Christmas a little fun, he says.
And the one with the voucher??
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid full price for it.
Then I will also rate this accordingly!
We don't need to debate the better dish here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a spinning skewer.
And both have their name from that.
In German, an equivalent would perhaps be something like the "Dreher", which sounds nowhere near as delicious.
Problems with fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I am now having trouble establishing a stable wifi network.
Previously I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent out 50 Mbit flawlessly except for a few dropouts.
The new fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and at the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, these also arrive.
However, at the other DLan module, which emits the Wifi, no longer come the full 500, but the further I move away in the house with the module, the less comes on (so use an outlet that is located 1, 2, 3, etc.. Rooms away from the other module).
As a result, the Internet with the new fiber-optic connection is now even slower on the second floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here as well.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line with fiber?
And is LAN really the some solution?
It would be extremely costly to lay LAN cables in the house.
I am really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
Therefore, I would be even more pleased to receive an answer.
When it's time to switch checking accounts
Anyone who thought that the current accounts would be quiet for the time being was mistaken.
While many banks have used the fall to have their customers reconfirm past fee increases with all sorts of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates are also continuing to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now it has halved the tax-free amount and even quartered it for call money.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank Group division - to 50,000 euros for checking and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for overnight deposit accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly concluded individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as it did at ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has lowered the tax-free amounts in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, it is still involved in a legal dispute with the consumer associations, which even won their case against this regulation in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court.
Now, banks are already discussing whether they should possibly set aside provisions - in case the higher courts also declare the negative interest rates to be inadmissible in principle and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is like an up and down ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) has been voted the most influential woman of the year by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
Her appearance is taken care of by a whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers.
After all, Aniston says, she treats herself to a chip a day (yes, you read that right: a SINGLE chip out of the bag).
The fact that the hearts of female and male fans fall equally to her is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just unlucky - and still looking for the big love.
And crossed the baby wish off the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she was going to become a mother.
That pained her.
The people who asked this have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope that success and fame also make you happy.
Unworthy end to a career: Raikkonen has to retire
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell to Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight contact with the barriers, Räikkönen had to park his Alfa Romeo after less than half the race distance at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in motorsport's premier class.
His wife Minttu and their two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Raikkonen's greatest success was winning the 2007 world championship in a Ferrari.
He managed 21 Grand Prix victories, started from pole 18 times and finished on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich takes 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
"I've done the math, I'd have to win nine and a half races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First he fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths on Saturday by moving from third to first.
Then he changed something in the material setting and drove out a larger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he won ahead of the British Brad Hall.
Third place went to Austria's Benjamin Maier.
"We took bigger risks today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also notched his 22nd consecutive win.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, who drives for Stuttgart, came in fifth after finishing second before.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after placing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it the same way," Lochner said.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
In the women's event, Laura Nolte claimed her third win of the season in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After only managing fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to World Cup victory on Sunday in the German triple with pusher Deborah Levi.
Olympic two-man bobsleigh champion Mariama Jamanka of BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt of Burghausen.
She recorded her first podium finish this winter in addition to her Olympic qualification.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama took me.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, but there is also an enormous amount to do around it.
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the less than flawless driving, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I have just not received it and therefore can not redeem why I finally asked.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now they said it expired which makes me very upset.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I want to return it and then order again since it's reduced right now :)
Why is shipping not started until 3/16?
There was nothing about such long delivery time on your website
No only when I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
Was taken off yesterday by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly shipped would.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
And do not cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY....
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have some things that I just want to write and maybe it goes to one - or another so ...
I'm 24, have kPTBS, a full time student, and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to daycare he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My boyfriend (together for 6yrs) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is in therapy now).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him to shower (because hand is in the bandage wg burn).
On top of that, he has a cold and we see each other less at the moment (1-2 times a week) which makes me very uncomfortable with my need for affection and love.
My dog child has just a stomach ache, I have cooked for him and now he lies in his cuddle blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and stroking for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month right now.
Now there is also housework to do, which we share of course.
But cooking by myself is a lot of work for me right now....
My PTSD illness is just about set, I'm reasonably well treated and coping.
Not good, but I cope and am almost symptom free.
My university demands a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow I have an anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I have an oral exam right on Tuesday, and what comes then is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing goes on, right?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the vacations.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental clues, because otherwise I won't be able to cope.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't manage it any other way....
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't even put that into words.
Don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think this also has something to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you in any case still a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
On the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
Now when we will swap the table I will get other color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 12/26 #NUMBER#.
Two times, by the way.
However, it was not confirmed.
On a completely different note, I noticed back in school that many religion teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
For me it was always a bit strange, maybe also because I was raised Christian and so I always kind of believed.
Where do you stand on this?
Maybe you can also tell about work and or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between personal and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum etc.
But it would be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in relativity.
Then what makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
Preserve culture or something?
Hope you question is not too private.
Can not it be changed or not?Write English I also understand well
That is already very long, then I would refrain from it
Is good, thank you.
I expect to hear back in a timely manner, no later than early next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (am 24).
I think it was a film for teenagers.
There are two timelines (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead)(not quite sure).
Since I can not describe it in detail anyway in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, paths cross and action ensues.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live himself, I mean.
The passage is I think also the burial place of the soldier.
In the end, I think both soldiers fight each other.
If this means anything to you I am grateful for any answer.
Our little one slept only on her tummy from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child like that can take a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything around is right, no cuddles, go in and look often, but no minutes of surveillance.
That's what drives you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, it has always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it straighten up a bit from the belly?
Or is it lying face first Directly in the mattress?
From this you can deduce whether everything is in order.
We all grew up and when my husband was born, it was common practice to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already bought a lot of items
But then why offer me only 20EUR?
Hello, I have already written yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It's about my closet that arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not to be used like this at the moment.
To put it bluntly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV, too.
It's just that the politics of this station are now beneath contempt.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then to go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said to be an "independent" Internet station.
Quote Arno: One does not want to be "a running advertising pillar".
What is one now?
An 0815 commercial station that tries to bring its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's do's & don'ts.
Which, of course, apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
They may, of course, continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How is anyone supposed to like all this?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I ask for recall, because my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Body breakage due to damaged delivery of #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for a tummy ache or just to cuddle - My little warmth friend is versatile.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in doses.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes it especially comfortable to use, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following areas of application:

Please remove the inner cushion from the cover beforehand to warm it up!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner pillow back into the cover.
During the first heating, there may be a slight formation of moisture on the surface, but this disappears with repeated applications.
It is essential to adhere to the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burns!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After placing the heated inner pillow back into the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) on the crook of your arm!

Darmstadt second after first half - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of a return to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the bottom of the table.
Things are not going well for Ingolstadt under its third coach either.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top match, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) stopped charging through my power adapter.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought power supply alone is also sufficient for operation.
Wrong, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the power adapter being plugged in.
I then removed the battery, but again nothing happens.
Maybe you have some ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in mains mode?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But do not know how high the seat.....
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment with you?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
20 liters of capacity swallow even larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stowed with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever other everyday items you need remain well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical access points in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design literally has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still allowing access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works in two ways: Once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with the Messenger Bags.
In this case, the closure flap has a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thereby considered different "filling levels": there are namely 4 anchor bars, stably riveted, in which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a lower one.
Flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be reliably closed without engaging the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of traditional top access backpacks - you don't have to dig through the contents anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the suitability of the backpack for everyday use: namely, when you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
The Everyday Backpack lets you customize the interior (more on that below) so you can easily store both separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
This also allows you to pull the backpack in front of your body from the right side, for example, to access camera gear in the main right compartment, while everyday things stay safely in the left half of the backpack and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable carrying straps help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will stay dry even when it's time to head to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday from confirmation for commissioning the
Contact announced on the part of the shipping company to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
So far I have not received any message.
I ask for immediate processing.
I am now already writing with the third support employee, with none of them I got further than the promise that I will receive a mail as confirmation.
It is the return of the wrong custom #NAME# delivered.
Is it foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me....
It works.
Many many thanks for the help
Wish you still a nice evening
hello, my order no is #NUMBER#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend me the voucher, then I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And I couldn't have known that the past year would turn out differently than I had thought, and I just wasn't able to redeem and clarify it in time.
But the damage I have as a customer and I do not accept that so.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then mechanically machined (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics peculiar to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created, with the balancing of the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
Tuned discs made in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the gates improve the cleaning of brake discs and pads.
Aesthetic properties of our tuned windows thereby emphasize the character of each car through attractive and eye-catching appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the south fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and sparked what became known as the "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was Coloma or Bust!
In this game you are a pioneer who is looking for wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses and build businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your fellow pioneers to avoid going broke with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, you have to manage your resources and build a tableau that "works" more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual play style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma takes place over a three-year period from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the map where they can perform actions.
Then their choices are revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate sites.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables one half of the site - reducing the possible actions there.
Then players take turns performing actions such as gaining resources, moving wagons, pitching tents, fording rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunslingers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The praiser rotates to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, that is, has covered each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout where players have to defend Coloma from a raid of angry bandits.
When players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why children are not bullies" Docu, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary popped up in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
His book "Why Our Children Become Bullies" (2008) sparked a heated debate on education.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the movie is hard to take.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and others in authority must never, never, never! be about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for his or her development and to make the framework for the child as large as is reasonable and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: States discuss abolition of compulsory testing for triple vaccinated persons
At their next meeting, state health ministers plan to decide on a nationwide elimination of mandatory testing for triple-vaccinated individuals.
"We states need clarity quickly on whether and when the testing requirement can be waived for those vaccinated three times," Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, told Bild am Sonntag.
Dropping 2G plus for triple vaccinated individuals "not only makes medical sense, but also provides an additional incentive to vaccinate," Holetschek said.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal on this to the Conference of Health Ministers as early as next Tuesday." - afp
So I want to send the lamp back
What is the best way to proceed?
Hi, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, however I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
I can no longer make a purchase through my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Oops, an error has occurred.
Purchase via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer goes.
I have updated the account data.
What could be the reason for this?
What you describe is called *awareness*, which is sensory perception under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
The most frequent occurrence is the hearing of sounds/voices, less frequent is the seeing of images, and the rarest of all is the perception of pain.
Relevant to this topic: Cesarean sections are surgeries associated with increased rates of awareness because of the avoidance of very deep anesthesia to protect the baby until weaning.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia pre-talk.
Certain anesthetic procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine correctly describes awareness, however, u/Nitemarex **by definition had none.
Misread her comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the €20 won't help us there either.
These are legal warranty claims.
Surely the bare minimum would be for them to take the defective chair back.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the eCommerce sector.
Please check again if you at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We're losing quite a bit of money there, too.
I already sent you an email, which you did not answer.
Again the question.
In the order and on the invoice it says that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I will have to cancel the order as I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the second floor for me.
don't they call me?
I had formulated a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle dies at the age of 97
He has distinguished himself as a theater critic and as an artistic director.
Later he wrote a monumental history of theater.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, hot off the press: "An Old Man Grows Older".
The harrowing diary of a slow farewell to the world kept by theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I testify here already my life thanks".
There are several types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets used as load carriers mainly in the European area.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
In 2020, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria, according to data from Statistics Austria.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not collected
New York wins MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.
After a 1-1 draw in regulation time against host Portland Timbers, the Eastern Conference team decided the final 4-2 in a penalty shootout.
In the Eastern Conference final, New York had won against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I had gotten a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
We had this for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I have a taste for it and want to cook roulades for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will prepare a beef stock for it.
Other than that, do you guys have any tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a big pot.
Where do we go from here?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but I can manage it.
IIt is about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed by mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But to date, I have not received the money.
Would you please check there.
Where to still find Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and presents.
You have not got poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube power amp contributes significantly to the warmth and fatness of the guitar amp sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls you can adjust the desired level on the one hand and the distortion content of your sounds on the other.
Furthermore, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything in the "gain" and distortion.
It has already been mentioned above that the POWER LEVEL control can even be used to provide a power reserve when it gets outrageously loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL control, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack so you can jam out to your favorite tunes.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also buy a VFS5 footswitch, you can easily call up the sounds by foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new powerhouses, VOX is taking another step into the future!
Had seen it that way with others, though.
Is there any way to return the lamp?
As it hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back then.
Can you help me further with this?
And the dresser?
Will we get another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it does not work, I would also be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need are then but a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the hook provided.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in nuclear deal negotiations
Iran says progress is emerging in negotiations to revive the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the issues to be included on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told Irna news agency on Sunday.
This was a "positive and important development," he said, because initially there had not even been agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement had resumed after almost a week of interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
A U.S. delegation is also on site in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now Federal State with highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
It is the only state in Germany to exceed the 1000 mark.
Thuringia was the only state to exceed the 1000 mark for corona incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day figure as 1025 new infections per 100,000 population.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence nationwide recently, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had decreased slightly, but had also been above 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to infection were reported within one day.
200 people severely ill with Covid-19 were receiving intensive care in hospitals on Sunday.
Reporting delays may occur on weekends.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and can hardly keep up with the registration of new cases.
I understand that.
Since delivery is not until early March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print this out and stick it on the package and hand it in at the post office, that's it, right?
I don't have to click/enter/fill out anything else here?
This is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to please return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is in my eyes a cheek.
It's time for change
###MBundestag greetings, I am u/StratorDE in the Chamber in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag you can see one thing: It is not extant.
We have gone into a winter stupor and extended the summer slump to several months.
#What's the problem?
Yes, what was the reason?
For the most part, it's probably just related to dissatisfaction with how some things have gone here and how we're doing in general.
In recent days, the impression has become increasingly apparent that many here really still have Bock on the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is needed, which wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who became aware of this project in the last few days and found what is, simply put, a shambles.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have been found who are willing to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to once again expressly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project also have an existence in the future.
For this purpose, we have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server, where we can exchange ideas, as well as work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How should the MBundestag function in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be changed / adjusted / removed?
* How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair election system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot some things, but that's not a bad thing, we have Discord at the end for that.
If you feel like it and have time, come to Discord, collaborate and let's decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you for this purpose that is yet to be delivered.
Now I see that the item is too big/clunky for it and not suitable for my taste.
For this I have already ordered from you another suspension.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this is returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG#, does it come in oversize, 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to make that happen now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but will dismantle the cabinet as far as possible for the pickup - you need to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how that can work then.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to schedule a pickup.
Is there a manual for the assembly?
How long would I have to get them or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself was a vegetarian for a while, and currently eats meat very rarely.
I myself was also a vegetarian for a few years before.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without thinking much.
And that is that for a long time I thought that as a vegetarian I was supporting animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that by doing so I was ultimately also supporting animal cruelty.
Hence my decision to go vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that displeasure arose on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian you reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "heavy-handed"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise, without that you would put it on.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be on site on the assigned date #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Since I can not be on site because of a funeral, unfortunately, this can not be changed.
Can I please be assigned an alternate pickup date.
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I can be found again throughout.
Lahnstein fire department equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euro grant from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, presented the Mayor of Lahnstein, Peter Labonte, with a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue equipment vehicle for the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in service since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in safety.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving squadron, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, the number of operations is expected to rise in the long term: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle and the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river are contributing to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of the time and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
Followed their recommendations however have synced, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING has worked.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and now I hope for help.
Okay, it's like this then.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

Thanks first for that you face the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in government service in a similar activity, we were also gun carriers in the executive, further I would not like to go into it!
I always find the question of right and left very simplistic.
Basically, however, it should be said that the civil servant tends to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
That of course also in the special uniform and weapon carriers people right of conservative magically attract should also be clear to everyone, that these people then of course with the lived reality difficult to deal with is of course also clear, because you have of course next to the average white, now many Germans with migration background, Women and homosexuals (and I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine cliché gays, because there are fewer or none of them in the executive, but rather normal men and women who don't notice it if they don't tell you) and I can and must rely on these people, too, because in case of doubt they will save your life or use it for you.
But even these marginalized groups represent, even if it sounds strange at first, in my experience, a conservative attitude, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel less picked up by exaggerated left-wing policies, even if these policies supposedly stand up for them or think they have to do right by them, but they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right-wingers, since of course the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, extreme right-wingers will also be found there, but the fact that they are allowed to openly express their opinions there or even openly forge any plans that endanger the state is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who have often been deployed abroad often start to generalize due to negative experiences and even say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
Also it happens that certainly also times right-minded comrades meet which operate a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, such a thing is fought well in my opinion and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment of the whole!
Germany is so much involved internationally and that is good in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
yes, what I do not understand, the other basket I also ordered on the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, was not sold out.
I have already ordered in November.
but it was confirmed to me so in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I was chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black still be delivered to Germany or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find only you as a partner company.
but on top of the edge of the wooden part are two deep notches, which were filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More orderly through child?
Hello, there is one thing that has been bothering me (w32) for a while.
I'm very disciplined and organized at work, (I'm self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I've managed to keep my household clean and tidy.
There are always phases where everything gets left behind, and then every now and then it grabs me and I tidy up and clean.
But it is actually never so "that someone could come spontaneously to visit".
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it bothers me somewhere but mostly household just loses to work and unwillingness.
The kitchen is still cleaned most regularly as we love to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become neater with child?
We don't have one yet but are working on it and this question has been on my mind for a while.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just does not bother me so much, as long as no visitors come and e.g. always fresh clothes are there and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
Looking forward to your responses.
Exclusive, new, and high quality and anatomically pre-shaped cut, provides maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unrestricted freedom of movement.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I did an apprenticeship in software development and have been out of it for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I realize more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking about starting over and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxious avoidant) personality disorder (AEVPS).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and am accordingly shy.
I don't have a problem talking to people on a factual level, but it's very hard for me to have casual conversations and I've been told before that I seem unapproachable (although I think that's gotten better).
Can I become a social worker like that?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in addiction counseling or family support, for example.
However, I don't know if the actual working day is really like I imagine it, and it's difficult to find anything about it on the Internet.
The AOPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it gets me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("screwed up the simplest things again") and I find it hard to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this myself by now"/"I'm keeping him from working with my stupid questions"/"he must really think I'm low" etc.).
I will probably have the problems in every profession but I wanted to mention it at this point.
But you have already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation of that either.
I am waiting for an appointment for pickup
What do you mean by return please !
When I downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, I get the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
are there any problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG# who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The bird breaks down the protein ingested with the feed in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and builds up its own proteins from these, which it also needs for plumage formation.
Plumage formation in the nestling and new plumage formation in the molting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high level of stress for the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as this may lead to disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this course of NEKTON-Bio, the patient should return to daily vitamin supplementation with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

1 g NEKTON-Bio to 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
One level measuring spoon (enclosed) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
In case of severe plumage damage, double or triple the dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the onset of plumage regeneration is visible.
After that, the normal dose is given until plumage regeneration is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse them, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months ?
The warranty period in Germany is 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to say that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a municipal employee in contradiction to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be cut down on our property.
So a felling application was submitted to the municipality.
A staff member writes me that cutting fruit trees, and therefore walnut, is not part of the statute.
However, the statute explicitly states walnut as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the them new packaging for it.
I have not received any message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What were more expensive?
yes, I think so, only the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to me in Germany
Can you check?
Breaking news: Serious traffic accident near Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the junction Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the police press alert currently informs (14:03), a passenger car has entered oncoming traffic while overtaking.
There are casualties.
Ah okay I see.
Well, then thank you again that it went so easily!
Advice and ideas on further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately moderately good, because my dear head just zerdenkt everything that can be zerdenken.
Before I get carried away here ... in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - that is, from you.
I am currently doing the Ref as a lateral entry.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked in a field there (to remain at least a little anonymous, I won't mention anything more specific here).
But then the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that might be more fun.
At some point, I landed on the teaching profession and was sure that this was it - even though the framework conditions are significantly less flexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I'm now on my third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
The times before that I always decided to go ahead and at least finish the ref, after that I can always change my mind.
But right now I am absolutely finished.
I have had so little free time the last month that I am completely drained.
It's the vacations now, but there's still a pile of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref I always thought I was stress resistant, but then my weekend was also my weekend and my after work was my after work.
I was off then.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the Ref is also going well in terms of feedback and such.
But I'm completely drained and wondering how much stress my body can take before it shuts down completely - if it isn't already.
I ask myself whether I want to spend the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or whether I shouldn't go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take time off when I needed it, and found the work kind of boring, but was paid appropriately for it and worked on something together in a team and not as a lone fighter, as is the case most of the time now.
But then I wonder if in a year's time I won't be back in the same place I am now and dissatisfied.
You realize it's all kind of confusing, but maybe as an outsider you have advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, that I'm completely done and start crying at the slightest thought.
I'm not going to make any emotional decisions right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny undertone from me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has continued to evolve, resulting in, among other things, the combination of advanced modeling technology with "Valve Reactor" circuitry that perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers wait with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also include the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these simply manage the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed cabinet and bass reflex system from which the natural resonances just bubble.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual plane until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet newly added sound requirements, which has led to another performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as more numerous and decisively improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find it here.
All guitarists dream of the punch and dynamics of a tube amp: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that it is primarily the power amplifier that determines the tube character of an amplifier, and based on this finding, they developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances and tonal character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Magic lose at Clippers despite 20 points from Wagner
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 at the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable, with three Velcro dividers that can be individually placed and folded to suit the needs of your photography gear, making it suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLRs.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and lenses.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a clip-on flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models in the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for more lenses.
In addition, you can still store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photographic things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, lava flows have caused extensive damage on the Canary Island.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa, lasting 84 days.
No reliable data are available on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still did not dare to predict when it might end.
Indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV station RTVE.
Damage in the millions
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000-degree lava has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other structures, RTVE reported.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1700 soccer fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, cooled lava created two new headlands with a combined size of about 50 hectares.
The most severely affected sector was banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper El País.
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
There is something seductive about the many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree combined with the spiritual atmosphere and crackling tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peacemaking "social contract of primitive peoples," escapes the rigid routine and can be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through whom Christmas was closely linked to gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were presented to each other in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this custom, which is still popular today, is that St. Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women one night to save them from another life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving gifts gave rise to the popular custom in Germany of filling the boots of children in particular with gifts.
Protestants took offense at this custom because they reject mediators between God and man as "veneration of saints."
For these reasons, they oppose the institution.
Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into the Christ Child, thus establishing a new line of tradition.
The focus of gift-giving thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such matters of detail in such a narrow light, it upsets only a few that the custom of St. Nicholas, similar to the custom of St. Martin with St. Martin's singing and St. Martin's procession, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today, you can find everything from socks to coveted luxury watches in boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources prove a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christianized countries, however, there is a merry huddle over the question of who brings the presents to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white ruffled beard, which has little in common with the rather severe Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer and his preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Magi give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost made it to some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the wake of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near the Royal Palace
An armed man was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man walking into a bank and a bookie's store with a gun.
The man fled in a vehicle that officers were able to stop a short time later, according to authorities.
Shots were fired and the man was hit, he said.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
The area around Kensington Palace is home to several embassies.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
which ones?

In Hollywood spectacle, it's mostly menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow colorfully inside.
Smart Stone", on the other hand, is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or colored light (in no less than six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It also does well in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where it knows how to hold its own thanks to its size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparatory work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" requires neither supply line nor batteries.
Place the "light stone" in any place that receives sunlight during the day.
Two included ground spikes provide a firm hold when needed.
The matte white plastic cover itself is sturdy and weatherproof.
Smart Stone" discreetly hides its solar panel inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light, the other for colored light.
The battery already charges when sunlight falls on the case.
As dusk falls, "Smart Stone" automatically begins to glow; you decide for yourself in which color: You can choose from no less than six attractive light colors - in addition to daylight white.
Finally, the system also switches off automatically as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a predefined minimum or it becomes light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts all over again the next day.

Pill problem
Hello dear female people,
I hope I do everything right here, is after a year reddit actually my first post.
About my problem: I started taking the pill again out of necessity about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and crappy PMS before my period.
Now I would like to let it stay again, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic diseases, which I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had an explosion of pimples from 0 to 100 on my last break of about two years and they were everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it weighed quite heavily on me and I didn't feel well.
During the two-year break, things never really returned to normal.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid that this time.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and without fuss, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist did not take me so seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still to come.
Thank you so much to each:n who read through the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had prebupertary bad neurodermatitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale nodular lichen and the acne issue.
Nutrition I have also in the course of chr. illness tried everything possible and am stuck on ner sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed diet, because nothing else has worked so really well.
It may well be that hormonal simply the worm is in it, but if you have like me everywhere construction site you want to just rather not go looking for what else is going wrong.
I had already told everything to her colleague semina or similar.
Posted and now I've lost the conversation and don't know what was responded to my request.
I always have to work and answer the phone in between and suddenly everything was gone...
what is there to check, if the money was there I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
but does it generally exist in large
since it is available in black large

110 kV underground cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable near Tann is legally binding.
The planning approval decision by the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
This has now been announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The underground cable, which is around seven kilometers long, will connect the Tann substation in the north of the community and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts.
The blue Betsellnummer:#PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what is the further process now?
Have a great start to the week!
You can forget that, I already explained that yesterday several times!!!
This is a dresser made of glass and the entire sides are cracked, so there is glass everywhere and the box is broken
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the chest of drawers can not be collected, because no one is allowed to enter my apartment
Thanks for the message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is with all books, that's why the request to #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem
Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I've been in Ref since summer, I enjoy teaching, but I'm currently still having a lot of problems planning my lessons in geography in a time-efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped at all, so that I can basically only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as media.
At school, I can also only copy b/w for free (which sucks for erdkunde).
Currently, it just takes me a long time to schedule my lessons.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors, and for me, each lesson actually stands on its own.
In principle, the methods are also always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest an excessive amount of time even for simple lessons (I need it for UBs, etc.).
I actually always start planning from the learning goal (what do I want to accomplish) and then figure out how to build that (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe some geography teacher can tell me how to work with the book in a time efficient way.
Would be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to process the return as soon as possible.
Retailers fear for Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
Only those who have been vaccinated or have recovered are allowed into most stores.
Retailers consider this unnecessary and complain about a drop in sales.
He also has a possible solution ready.
In the view of the German Retail Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are spoiling the important Christmas business for retailers.
HDE CEO Stefan Genth criticized that sales of non-daily consumer goods had slumped.
According to a recent survey of 1100 retailers by the HDE, more than 70 percent of companies were looking negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What should be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," Genth said.
According to the report, retailers with 2G access restrictions lost nearly one-third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Things are only going well in food retailing and in the online sector.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Purchasing with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the chief executive.
"2G while shopping doesn't get us anywhere in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required high staffing levels.
The ribbon scheme must be allowed nationwide, he urged.
After that, each customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores that day with the wristband they received.
In addition, random checks should be sufficient in retail - as they already are in public transportation under the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
Deutsche Euroshop, the real estate group specializing in shopping centers, also spoke of difficult Christmas business.
Frequencies were recently at a good 75 percent of pre-Corona levels without 2G, while revenues were around 90 percent.
These figures are now sure to fall in the middle of the all-important Christmas business," CEO Wilhelm Wellner told "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions are tried to be found and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, in which "visitors provide their 2G proof once at a central point in the center, for example, and then - equipped with a wristband similar to those in a club hotel - can enter all stores without being disturbed." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a flaw on the frame, which was tried to be concealed with a yellow filler.
This looks unsightly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already put it back in the package and taped it shut.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
The adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp is provided by a modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities.
In addition to brightness adjustment, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and tungsten.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool for working both on a film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in TV studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory locations is simply occupied by pressing one of the memory buttons for a long time and done.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again, the known situation is again - very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operation with inexpensive NP-F rechargeable batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cinematographers (and women) - so you can use equipment you already have.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the batteries have enough power - there is a battery tester built right in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two displays (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the spotlight with power via the supplied power supply unit.
The construction of the headlamp is very simple.
They have a 16mm sleeve as a connector for attachment, so you can attach directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination can be reliably adjusted by means of locks on both sides.
Care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality and therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included in the scope of delivery.
Great is that the scope of delivery also includes a bag.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
Too bad, I got this as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after high-scoring comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had last been winless twice in a row, were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned on, shot the frustration about a mixed start to the season from the soul within a good hour and won furiously with 5:2. "It's insane what the guys have done today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN and pronounced a "blanket praise, to every single person who was there".
At the beginning, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, which is now in ninth place and continues to fall short of its expectations.
Patrik Schick had given Leverkusen a 2-0 lead.
What happened next impressed even the SGE coach.
"How the players then came back and put in a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I'm incredibly happy with the performance we showed and of course with the result.
Also, defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the field for the first time since the fourth game and his overcome muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is unbelievably great," said the 27-year-old, who was particularly happy for the spectators with a look at the result.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but also sees himself in a good position with regard to the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are physically in top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professional.
Now they want to "move forward step by step and remain modest" and "pull through the tasks at this level" until the turn of the year.
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6:30 p.m., Sky) on Wednesday as part of the English week.
Just now I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and having it rerouted, no chance.
Can it be resent directly to me or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
Would for me then unfortunately mean that I will not order again because it has already taken a long time.
Have they ever sat in the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dampers for women's handball ahead of quarter-final against Spain
Germany's women's handball team walked off the floor after their humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and blank stares.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB team conceded a bitter defeat with 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were far too timid and had too much respect for the opponent," judged national coach Henk Groener.
We have to perform differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
It was a bad game from everyone and we need to erase it," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the battle for a place in the semifinals, a significant improvement will be needed against the 2019 World Cup runners-up next Tuesday to keep alive the fragile dream of a first medal since 2007.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champions Denmark was back player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack, nor in defense," admitted back player Xenia Smits and demanded, "We have to look ahead quickly now."
Not up to scratch from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to speed with the kickoff.
Missed throws and technical mistakes in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
However, this was not the initial spark that had been hoped for.
The German women were hardly able to make an impact against the aggressive cover of the Danes - and if they did, they mostly failed because of the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
So the game was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later for a hard foul on her opponent.
However, she will be allowed to play again in the quarterfinals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection get into the game a little better and at least come within five goals by the break.
The already faint hope of catching up after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and thus made it easy for the well-behaved opponent, who is one of the medal candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team was unable to improve its performance and was the clear loser.

The title gives it away, I work as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams where (so far) only the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated mainly in nursing homes.
As these are soon to be completed to a large extent, it continues afterwards partly in vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit about the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not related to one personally (e.g. "I take medicine X, is it compatible with vaccination..").
My responsibilities include the education for the vaccination, the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination regulation and has no reasons against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any with us, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who, however, cannot (are not allowed to?) perform vaccinations, so that I also perform most vaccinations there myself.
Difficult "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What please is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberg resident, the BR television program "Wir in Bayern" (We in Bavaria) provoked a lot of thought.
But unlike many previous days, this time the term in the "Host mi?" series remained unguessed by callers.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous."
And also not one "to whom everything has to happen quickly".
This, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
Whereupon the man from Amberg communicated the solution and thus probably also provided for astonishment with many Upper Palatinates.
"The huidlerer," the audience learned, "is a rag that someone uses to wipe out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the rather well-known dialect word "Houdern".
This closed an educational gap - probably also for some people who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I have not been able to buy any books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I have gel#PRS_ORG#n, rebooted, connected to PC, synced and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Tire choice for road bike- really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy because I wanted to do at least a little training in preparation for my bike ride next week.
No sooner said than done and off I went with my road bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then happened what lurks in so every city center (this time: Thanks Krefeld!).
Glass shards on the track.
Zack, loud hiss and my rear tire wanted to go the rest of the way in no way.
Because of the day of the week I had no real possibility to get a spare coat and spare tube, I had to turn around again in a half bad mood and take the first best train home.
Was then also mood-technically not quite so bad, perhaps it is also better if I practice again before the bike ride that with the tire change.
But now I am faced with a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long stretch of road ahead of me over several days, I would be extremely reluctant to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, because even the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, has the day I came to pick up the bike to 14 o'clock 120km torn off!) and who had also already called these suboptimal, because he drove with them for mehere years on roll.
But when I think that I still have to change a tire after 80-90kms while driving, I think I'm in a really bad mood :D
Now I got into conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me in amazement why I did not have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unplattbar.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really so indestructible?
I have little desire to spend 40 € / tires now, only to be disappointed.
Furthermore, I wonder: I have at the moment on the road bike I think 25x622.
There are also (apparently?) With the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me on a road bike generally to other tires?
The Schwalbe page seems to my absolute! Laiewissen rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and best regards!
Car skids against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had crashed his car into a central island on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten for an unexplained reason and then drifted into the oncoming lane, according to police.
There it came to a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown against a tree and the man was trapped in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to surrounding hospitals.

After the release of our new high end full range driver B 100- 6 OHM it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would also get new blood.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and visually reminiscent of the great role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this build proposal directly includes a suitably designed foot to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but an exceptionally high level should be achieved in terms of sound.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds wimpy.
On the contrary, she appears considerably grown-up and extremely impressive and accurate for her size.
Tonally, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight treble rise.
This is common practice with full-range drivers to optimize the bundling that increases sharply at high frequencies.
Exactly aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
Turned slightly outward, the high-frequency range can be reduced, making the sound image warmer.
Thanks to the point source, the localization of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and amazingly precise.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM, which are worthy of reference, ensure fine dynamics that are second to none.
The SOLO 15 thus not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolving power and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final appearance of the speaker at the beginning in order to plan for appropriate changes during construction.
If, for example, you want to veneer the cabinets, the countersink of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer adds material again.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate point so that the cable can later be fed through there without any problems.
With the help of a router, the speaker opening now follows in the front, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be inserted flush.
On the rear side, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer to make the opening area of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the chamfer, as shown in the picture "Detail chamfer".
After that, you start the actual assembly of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back panel, the lid, the front and the bottom are now glued onto these.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued in the process.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if necessary, for example, if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
The next step is to apply the second side.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, that is, the two sides, as well as the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or a Forstner drill makes it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the rear panel.
Then use a round cutter to round off all the edges of the actual box.
It can also be used to round off the top of the footplate.
The base plate is then glued firmly to the base of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
The next step is to mark and pre-drill (2.5 mm drill bit) the screw connection points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After cleaning the housing from wood dust (vacuuming / blowing out), start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex port in the rear panel.
To do this, push the entire and untrimmed cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the base to the terminal opening and leave it sticking out there for about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the case, you lead the cable to the speaker opening and let it hang out loosely there as well.
Subsequently, the crossover is prepared and inserted.
The construction plan of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection diagram can be taken from the following document: Assembly instructions crossover Solo 15.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in place, the next step is to seal the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely sealed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a little skill, you can drip hot glue on the opening to seal it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the sealing accordingly.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and screwed tight with the appropriate screws.
Polarity plays an important role here, so the positive lead (marked wire) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and plugged in.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut in two and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex port should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered in early June?
> Hello to all,
> finally we can announce that we are hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for well-known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant more planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on via switch, so we'll be watching the 2021 Oscars with at least 7 beans streaming and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic - still, we'll do everything we can to keep the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Go ahead and chill drinks, plan on some good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
