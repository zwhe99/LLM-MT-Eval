From my point of view, the literature curriculum was shaped by ladies of balzac age based on their interests.
Of the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the perspective of those very ladies of balzac age.
And the psychology and anguish of Tolstoy's and Turgenev's heroines are not that interesting to teenagers.
Teenagers in general are rarely interested in the psychology of the characters.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195 mattress.
Micropackage Prestige model: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different rigidity of the sides: the medium-hard surface consists of latexed coconut fiber and natural latex, while the moderately soft surface is made of natural latex board.
Springing block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the effect of "waves" or "hammock.

This maintains a healthy microclimate in the sleeping area.
The mattress is also covered by an extended warranty period.
The term of the official warranty from the manufacturer is 5 years, in fact, the service life of the mattress is longer.
Protection from dust and dirt is entrusted to a removable jacquard cover, supplied in the kit.
Purchase an orthopedic pillow to pair with your mattress - it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filling determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as an anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.
Use your brain and chase those relatives away!
It's better not to have any than such...
Either look for an outside driver, or someone who is willing to invest and work with you in the share.

Andrew, it was clearly explained to you that the schools employ retired women, they will not work in the command line.
The computer teacher can't help either, he wasn't taught that, school kids play games in Windows.
So there's no support.
I remember with horror those feasts and guests at my parents' house.
The guests are on the doorstep, and the cutlets are still frying on the stove, and my mother, disheveled, is scrubbing the floor.
God, I sat down at the table already exhausted.
And then wash the dishes and clean the house.
A week before the holiday you haul groceries, two days of cooking, a day of cleaning up afterwards.
What about the guests?
It's good for them, and they have to take a cake with them.
Ever since then, I don't like holidays or guests.
Even for my family, I set the table at the minimum.
And I make them goodies, I bake them very often just for fun.
Germany: A fourth coronavirus vaccination is imminent
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final vaccination, but will continue with renewed vigor.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will probably be enough for complete protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced of this.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, Die Welt.
"We expect that a fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, fall at the latest," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that a fourth coronavirus vaccination could be given "in conjunction with flu vaccination."
This will help you get the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help fight the spread of a new strain of Omicron coronavirus.
And the new version is especially dangerous.
Thus, Omicron is three times more likely to be reinfected than Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
On this basis, the manufacturers of BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the Omicron coronavirus.
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer found that with two doses of the vaccine, the efficacy is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times.
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the Omicron strain," BioNTech and Pfizer emphasized.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, Bernd Salzberger, chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, advocates shortening the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both delta virus and omicron variant coronavirus.
"Israel's experience shows this very convincingly," the expert stressed.
Wobbler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21Â®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally designed for ice fishing, not just for backcountry fishing.
These vibes have a higher specific weight than their close-sized counterparts, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of application of these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin made of strong and resilient plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vib" in plumb fishing Bet-A-Vib shows quite an aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is simple monotonous animation, that is movement of the rod up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles, which can be caught.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant when fishing in winter pikeperch and large perch, and especially in the middle of winter, when you want point and aggressive feeding of the bait.
Upon reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, the Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also successfully used for winter fishing of pond trout.
To please her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It was also noted that the Bet-A-Vib is able to irritate the passive pike, not reacting even to live bait.
When catching back casts Bet-A-Vib demonstrates the range and accuracy.
This wobbler is clear and not capricious, goes well with fishing line and braided cords, even with large diameters.
For catching pike, pikeperch, ruff or perch in back casts, in addition to flat is also relevant "step", sometimes with "dribbling" on the bottom.
If you are fishing in a rugged area, you can change the front tee for a double, which will reduce the likelihood of snagging.
Among the baits of its class Bet-A-Vib among the most stable in the work and, consequently, one of the most catchable.
It can be used with equal success both on relatively shallow and quite deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young loafers are sitting on the necks of old parents.
The "golden youth" are clearly lazy people, most of them with no skills or knowledge.
A satiated life is conducive to idleness.
Perhaps Mishustin was referring to this large segment of the population.
You must be joking.
Not once have I seen shoes in this store that I wanted to buy.
What kind of multi-year wear are you talking about?

Libya claims 7,000 Russian mercenaries
There are more than 7 thousand mercenaries of the private military company (PMC) Wagner in Libya.
The chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic, Khaled al-Mishri, announced this on Sunday, December 12.
"Currently, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the Wagner PMC in Libya.
They also have airplanes.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jets at Gardabiya air base (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," he was quoted as saying by Anadolu Agency.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to take over" central Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain Presence
According to the interlocutor of the newspaper, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "located in Libya.
"Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufra, the agency's publication noted.
Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner PMC is supported by the Kremlin.
Where else could there be mercenaries
According to the agency, Wagner allegedly operates in nine countries in Africa - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection for leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, subsidiaries of Wagner receive certain privileges and licenses to use minerals and natural resources, as well as to supply arms, technology and military services to these countries," the article says.
According to the media, the "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is listed neither in the law enforcement agencies, nor in the registry of legal entities, and its fighters are not in the lists of personnel.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
Recall that earlier the postpresidents of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
The Council of the European Union is expected to approve this decision on December 13.
Situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is the de facto second chamber of parliament with an advisory function with the dominant Islamists in it, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single day of voting for the election of members of parliament and the head of state from December 24 to at least February 2022.
"Less than two weeks remain until the elections, and the chances that they will be held on time are rapidly declining," the article says.
Against this background, the High Electoral Commission of Libya has indefinitely postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates, reports the TV channel Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy; 29% believe that failures prevail.
"Examples of successes - "in Syria we defended, restored peace there," "the decision on Nord Stream 2," "the whole world was intimidated that cool weapons," "we took away the Crimea."
The main failures are "conflict with Ukraine," "confrontation with Western countries," and "isolation from the world," according to a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The Dubai government has completely done away with paperwork - all government services have also gone digital
The Dubai government has announced a complete move away from paperwork and toward digital technology.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marked the beginning of a new phase of digitalization in all aspects of Dubai - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," said the emirate's Crown Prince and Chairman of Dubai's Executive Council, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, on Saturday.
Now the internal and external document flow in all government agencies in Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all sectors without exception: health, housing and utilities, police, municipalities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government's initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of documents began in Dubai in 2018.
During that time, authorities estimated that 336 million pieces of paper were saved, which amounts to 14 million hours of human labor and $353.8 million in monetary terms.
Earlier, the mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
Dana, well, about dates of birth and how old the child is, it's already marasmus, about the class and group in kindergarten, too.
Well, I do not believe that there are such slackers.
And if they do, they obviously don't give a damn about anything, including the family.
My mother, her two brothers and grandparents lived at 3 Vladimirskaya Street, it was the first floor without bars.
They knocked first on the door, then on the window, then decided not to be ceremonious, broke the window and broke in, but Grandpa had a baseball bat, which they got.
These people knew for sure that there was someone at home...
Turkey's auto production and exports fall below 2020 levels
Turkey's auto production and exports fell sharply in November amid the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, industry figures for the first 11 months were worse than last year's result, Bloomberg reported, citing data from the Turkish Automobile Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were released from factories in Turkey in November, 20 percent less than a year earlier.
About 75.9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% less than last year's figure.
And if at the end of the first 10 months of this year the Turkish automotive sector showed a positive dynamics to last year, the results of 11 months of 2021, the output of cars was already 0.3% worse than last year's figure.
The reason for this fall was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a drop in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received a deferral of credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov told about the situation with the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, reports the correspondent of MIA "Kazinform".

Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily tolerate the "ocmiron" strain
The doctor suggested that people with a weakened immune system can tolerate it more easily than those with a strong body defense response
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the strain of the coronavirus "oxymyron" can be dangerous.
The cause should be looked for in the conditions of the virus origin.
Scientists believe that "ocmiron" originated in the body of a person infected with HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
That is, it met no resistance from the immune system when it mutated.
Because of this, it is more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no response from immunity, it became very fast.
Apparently, he may have more of these spike proteins there than he should, their antibodies were not cut down during the mutations," commented pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with a weakened immune system may tolerate "ocmiron" more easily than those with a strong body defense response.
It turns out that a strong body response to anything, to any infection, is not always a good thing.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
That's what happens with pneumococcal infections, when young 30-year-olds die, and old 60-year-olds carry it as a sneeze.
The young man's immune response is frantic, he is completely inadequate: where you could only wag a finger, he hits like a cannon at sparrows," concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded us that coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs can be bacterial or viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, you can often only buy the symptoms - all hope on the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - a fever, weakness, malaise.
Then come respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, scratchy throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left side, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, Russia may start vaccinating the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old by the end of the year.
Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the MIPT genomic engineering laboratory, noted that this category is very actively affected by covid.
Teenagers who go to school have the maximum amount of contact.
This is the most socially active stratum, like kindergarten students," Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the Laboratory of Genomic Engineering at MIPT, told Moscow 24.
Many thanks to the author for this article.
It was a pleasure to refresh my memories...
Teath-In.
Back in the seventies and eighties, not a dance floor was without the band's tunes.
And at home, gathering with friends, dancing to their music.
Immunologists hypothesize why obese people fall victim to covid
The authors of the paper studied adipose tissue left over from bariatric surgeries and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected, and showed a strong inflammatory response in doing so.
Scientists also examined the adipose tissue of patients who died from covid and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and flu viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid an immune system response.
SARS-CoV-2 is probably capable of this as well.
Biologist talks about the causes of dementia
Semyon Golosheikin, candidate of biological sciences, named the causes of dementia and told about ways to prevent it in an interview with Radio Sputnik.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from the disease.
The syndrome manifests itself as a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, the person has difficulty navigating even in familiar surroundings.
Golosheikin noted that neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins most often lead to dementia.
Certain factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity may play a role," he said.
Bad habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and sedentary lifestyle also influence the development of dementia.
Among the first signs the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and decreased level of abstract thinking.
"There is a debate that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for it," the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, the WHO recommends maintaining an appropriate level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, Professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics at the Lomonosov Russian State Medical University.
Anna Bogolepova, head of the cognitive disorders department of the Federal Brain and Neurotechnology Center, spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned about 30 thousand illegally exported artifacts from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return about 30 thousand artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, by Shaaban Abdel Gaouad, chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities at the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, on air at Al-Hayat TV.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Museum of the Bible in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gaouad specified that all the smuggled artifacts are registered in the archives.
Department officials are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts "monitor auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon their return the cultural property is restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find the bust of the pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at auction in London.
The auction house Christie's held an auction on July 4, at which a bust over 3 thousand years old was sold for $ 5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the piece of art was illegally removed in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the sun god Amon, was kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of ancient monuments illegally removed from the country at various times.
According to the authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological research "black diggers.
"Crimean Tatars are not counted" - and this is correct, because the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42 thousand people - that's how many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate nation, and the name of this nation consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse is demanding that its employees give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, the Financial Times wrote.
The fact is that in Europe and the U.S., the Swiss bank does not give its employees corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a cell phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to solve business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank uses the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee has used it to conduct a meeting with a client that has not been approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that have been used to deal with work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially Credit Suisse did not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergey Yesenin's life, 1925, was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the hardest for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego.
He is already out of any literary associations, spat with Imagism, he is known, in demand, at times strongly scolded by critics, even angrily, but the reading public is ready to carry him in their arms.
For the year was written more than 60 poems, many of them - true masterpieces, completed the cycle "Persian motifs," wrote the poem "Anna Snegina," published eight books, the collection "Russia Soviet.
And the main success - at the end of June 25, the State Publishing House signed a contract with Yesenin for the publication of his works in three volumes.
None of Sergei Alexandrovich's contemporary poets has ever received such an honor, he is the first!
Besides, it promised very good money: according to the contract the fee was 1000 rubles a month for 20 months (for example, a factory director received 300 rubles a month, and an engineer 200).
Funds were needed more than ever that year.
Yesenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter Sophia Tolstoy, it was necessary to arrange a family life, to support his sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
Life seemed to be getting better, there was something to rejoice about, but for him everything was painted mostly in dark colors, as if a nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin's death) had materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where the pain came from.
Whether the wind is whistling
Over an empty and deserted field,
It's like a grove in September,
The alcohol is crumbling the brain.
Many acquaintances pointed out that Yesenin had given up a lot, did not look good, obviously ill.
More and more frequent binges, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not only alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was made to Sergei Alexandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents.
For example, relating to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan, was improving his health in a clinic outside Paris with Professor Peter Gannushkin (again to him Yesenin will come two years later, already in Moscow).
But there is enough evidence of the poet's drinking, scandals on this basis, and arrests to the police - scattered in dozens of memoirs.
Since the early '20s, the poet's terrible romance with the green serpent had been developing rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin briefly stayed with a friend, the Imagist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Esenin, despite his very good income, never had his own apartment in Moscow or St. Petersburg; he found himself in rented apartments, hotels, or with acquaintances.
Startsev recalls:
"He only came overnight, and most of the time in an insane, drunken state.
One day, returning at four in the morning, Yesenin fell on the landing...
As he fell, he scratched his face and wheezed.
When he came to, he started coughing incessantly, splashing blood all over the sheet..."
Yes, and Yesenin himself, after a trip to Europe and the U.S. (in the States then was dry law, but Duncan took with him a decent supply of booze) admitted:
"I saw nothing there but taverns and streets...
I stopped remembering people towards the end...
Well, and drinking, of course...
And I drank because I was bored.

Now my son is almost 16, and he hasn't had the urge to fool around for a long time.
All energy is directed toward choosing what he will do for a living.
He's much more responsible than I was in his years or my husband, who was in periodic trouble with the law until we were married.

Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as a "weapon" against the EU
Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as a "weapon
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jablonski expressed the opinion that President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such "operation" next year.
The deputy foreign minister made a statement to this effect in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonski, sanctions against Belarus have temporarily "stopped Lukashenko", but he is "actively looking for new ways".
The Polish official also believes that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons "in many parts of the world.
As kp.ru wrote, the European Union previously introduced a fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
Europe declared its readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic "if the situation in the country does not improve.
Minsk responded by imposing a food embargo on a wide range of products from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"The wrong man for the wrong hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man a laughingstock
Velvet jackets dominated the social events of 2021.
Perhaps the first person to announce his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
Back in September at the premiere of "No Time to Die," he appeared in a velvet crimson jacket and a traditional "Bond" butterfly.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore a green velvet jacket inappropriate for the royal dress code to The Earthshot Prize ceremony and then chose a more classic version for an event in support of the Royal Variety charity.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messiah also tried on the trend.
The footballer came to pick up his seventh Ballon d'Or in a Dolce & Gabbana velvet jacket.
By the way, his sons wore the same.
AliExpress is already seeing growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, received by "Gazeta.Ru", they began to buy 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with lining and fitted silhouette, the main colors - dark beige, burgundy, navy blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - velvet suits sets they choose less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment velvet jackets this season are presented in almost all brands - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, Saint Laurent.
The most coveted is the Gucci model, in which brand ambassador Jared Leto appeared at one of the premieres of the movie "House of Gucci".
Choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special technology of interlacing the threads is a dense fabric with a snaggy exterior texture and a smooth interior side.
More budget versions are made of cotton or polyamide, but, accordingly, lasts less.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhoshkin, warns that in the case of the velvet jacket is not the main thing - not its model or style, and relevance.
"Velvet requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you're going to a party or a gala event," explains Vakhoshkin. - It is also suitable for those cases where the invitation specifies the "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie" dress code.
Another important criterion, the observance of which allows you to choose in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of his buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, must have the right advanced hangout with affluence," say the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Handsome Brammell. - The owners of velvet jackets tend to belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to timed social events, where the dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with the same smart things: classic pants with arrows, solid color shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.
Things that are too simple and casual will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Handsome Brammell" sure: the appearance of an ordinary employee in a velvet jacket at a corporate party will be inappropriate, but if we are talking about "the head of those who run this event - "yes", he such a thing in the theme.
If the employee is of lower rank, and his goal is to move up in the complex hierarchy of the company or to beat out financial bonuses, it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The leadership is sure to appreciate the phrase "the wrong man for the wrong hat," say the editors of the Telegram-channel about men's fashion.
A very ambiguous feeling from the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, it's so forced.
And not at all associated with a pretty face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But with all my heart I wish you good luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well lobbied, that is, paid for.
Billions of dollars in investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity went up.
The traditional energy industry is also not at a disadvantage - both gas and oil and coal were bought cheaper than they are sold now.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
A penny drops.
Who's out then?
As usual - the average customer.
Do the problems of the Indians touch the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who "slept through" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good payoff.
I didn't see a single beautiful person in the pictures in the article.
Just mediocre within the average commuter.
Perhaps if such characters are so sure of their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole wagon, they probably won't get hooked on them.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "handsome(s)," but certainly not because of their appearance.

Immunologist says revaccination in four to five months will help protect against the omicerone strain of coronavirus "
Revaccination after four to five months can protect against a new strain of coronavirus omicron infection.
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called vaccination in six months, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, "a very long period.
"With previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to conduct the procedure in five months, and people with chronic diseases - in four," the expert said, calling for parallel to the vaccination campaign, to engage in revaccination.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has had two vaccinations and a booster, or has been over-vaccinated and vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and over-vaccinated, then they have gotten 'hybrid immunity,' which means there are plenty of antibodies and neutralizing enough," the expert clarified.
"G7 warned Russia of "large-scale consequences" in case of invasion of Ukraine
The G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States) issued a statement following the meeting of their foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have enormous consequences and will cost Moscow dearly," but the document does not describe specific measures.
"We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric toward Ukraine," the statement said.
The ministers further urge Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels and abide by its international commitments regarding military transparency," as U.S. President Biden said during a video call to Russian President Putin on Dec. 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the G7 foreign ministers also say.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious price to pay in return," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement also said.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Truss, said that Russia would face "serious consequences" if it invaded Ukraine.
According to her, the meeting showed "a unified voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP and have made it very clear that an invasion of Ukraine would have enormous consequences for Russia."
Pfizer vaccine found to be 32 times less effective against Omicron strain
The efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to the rest of the disease.
This is the conclusion reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug from COVID-19.
"We see that most people had high levels of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but that ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variant," Professor Malik Peiris told us.
At the same time, scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease when infected with coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of a coronavirus pandemic, given the impact of the omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the Omicron strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality if additional measures were not taken.
Head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry accused the FRG of blocking NATO arms supplies to Kiev
Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of lethal weapons as part of NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and anti-drone rifles.
It is noted, however, that Berlin later softened its stance on the rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the defense minister, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the aforementioned weapons as part of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania, and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz on allowing arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andrei Melnyk expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect Berlin to supply arms under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous FRG leadership explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of a military escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite Russia's "occupation" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will retain under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kiev expects help from Berlin to equip its navy.
Ukraine expects Germany "to be a partner of Ukraine in the technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year the co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany, Robert Habek, visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

Ways to get back money stolen through online stores revealed
There are several ways to recover money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in a conversation with RBC.
So, to reduce the risk of major losses if the bank card data fall into the hands of cybercriminals is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account, which are not used in online shopping.
Part of the savings can be set aside in a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend having a separate card for online shopping.
If money has been stolen from stores that do not use 3D Secure technology, you can initiate a refund procedure.
"Under the rules established by payment systems, unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure are the responsibility of the participant in the chain of payments, who does not use this service," said a representative of Promsvyazbank.
Artur Zaremba, an expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, stressed that the buyer has the right to apply to the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be protested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return the money to the customer if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, Ekaterina Mizulina, a member of the Public Chamber and director of the League of Safe Internet, reported that in 2021 alone there were 11 thousand appeals on various cases of fraud: from sale of fake documents to identity theft.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints against online fraudsters.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
Newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the Russian troop build-up near Ukraine's borders and the situation with Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz declared his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for years to come, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that he would urge Scholz to oppose Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravetsky, Russia can use the pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
For its part, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stem the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains a point of contention.
The European Court of Justice fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violated EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national law took precedence over EU rules.
Germany's new government, sworn in Wednesday despite Polish and U.S. demands, has made no public commitment to stop Nord Stream 2 if Russia invades Ukraine.
U.S. officials have told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany to stop the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border, a position confirmed by the G7 on Sunday.
Dimitri, look closely.
The view outside the window is the same, the size of the window has not changed.
They removed the wall between the kitchen and the room, so you can partially see the second window.
And in general, those who are not familiar with the initial layout have doubts.
And I know this kind of apartment very well and I can see exactly how it was redesigned.
May all be well with them.
It always amazes me when people write about tools to clean sinks, toilets, window sills, and faucets.
Do you wash them once a year at Easter, or do you have to wash them?
Just don't let it get dirty.

Doctors warned of the dangers of prolonged use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccinations
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergey Tokarev warned about the dangers of uncontrolled use of blood thinners after COVID-19 coronavirus infection and before vaccination against coronavirus.
Irina Yartseva, an internist and immunologist, said that self-prevention of possible blood clots after COVID-19 can provoke a stroke.
Yartseva explained that blood thinners are not intended for everyone, only if the patient was hospitalized, was in the hospital, and had complications.
The doctor prescribes anticoagulants (blood thinning drugs that prevent excessive blood clots) when indicated.
She said that nowadays there is obscurantism - everyone takes anticoagulants for a long time and gets complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (cerebral hemorrhage).
Sergey Tokarev, chief prophylactologist of the Urals Federal District, scientific director of the Society of Preventive Medicine Specialists and Doctor of Medicine, told URA.RU that anticoagulants are now often used indiscriminately by Russians before vaccination against coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe dubious advice on the Internet and begin to self-medicate.
There are those citizens who start taking anticoagulants a week before vaccination by their own decision.
And during the preliminary examination before vaccination, doctors notice bruises.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without finding out the cause of any symptom.

The plumber who found the money in the church wall will be paid $20,000
A plumber who found money in a church wall in the U.S. state of Texas will receive a reward.
This was reported in a press release from Crime Stoppers of Houston, a nonprofit organization.
The incident took place at the large Lakewood Evangelical Church, where Pastor Joel Osteen preaches, promising wealth and prosperity for devout Christians.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley was repairing one of the church toilets and found thousands of bags of money and checks under the insulation.
He gave the find to the church and, according to him, didn't even get a thank you from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, 'You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
The find appears to be related to a theft that occurred at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks, which were stored in the church safe, went missing.
The money was insured, so the church suffered no loss.
Nevertheless, for information about the criminals announced a reward of 25 thousand dollars.
Justin Cowley could not qualify for this amount because the award had already expired.
Even so, Crime Stoppers of Houston, a nonprofit organization that once donated five thousand dollars to the award and later received another $20,000 in donations from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He'll get $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that police questioned Pastor Joel Osteen about money found in a Lakewood church wall.

Brazil obliged citizens to show vaccination passports when entering the country
In Brazil, the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luiz Roberto Barroso ruled that it is obligatory to require covid passports for those entering the territory of the state.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens with contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a certificate of vaccination.
Also on the exclusion list are those who come from countries where there is a proven lack of vaccine.
"The situation is even more serious when you consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-carnival and carnival parties and other events, which suggests an increase in tourist traffic," said Barroso.
Earlier, Brazilian authorities obliged tourists unvaccinated against coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.

According to him, this can be achieved by injecting and applying the nasal vaccine.
When administered internally, large amounts of immunoglobulins A are produced. This is not the case when the vaccine is injected.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside after vaccination we have the most immunoglobulin G (antibodies) produced.
And if you give both vaccines, you get a lot of immunoglobulin A and G. But so far there is no decision on double vaccination," said the physician.
Sergey Tokarev, chief prophylactologist of the Urals Federal District, Doctor of Medicine, in his turn, stated that the main advantage of nasal vaccination combined with injection vaccination is the possibility to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that it would help that in this case the protection of the body, presumably, should become maximum.
Earlier, Minister of Health of Nizhny Novgorod region David Melik-Guseinov stated that the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children will lead to a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is exactly the picture seen in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, um...
I had this conversation with my male dog (he died a long time ago) - if you are ready to trade a warm home, food, affection, love and games for a heifer bitch, then go ahead.
But the dog was trained and generally smart.
He would choose my company and go home.
The video shows a method that works 90% of the time.
Not from the ceiling, believe me.
I stopped many owners from running after the dog, even though they wailed that there, 200 thousand running away (pomski), I took them by the hand and led them in the other direction.
In the end, the "200,000" was choosing the owner over the dog that ran somewhere out there.
Mass anti-vaccination protests continue unabated in Europe
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with restrictive measures and the authorities' plans to make vaccination against covid compulsory.
Starting next February, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
Spaniards outraged by the authorities' health policies held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some were holding placards that read "This is a false pandemic," "I won't get vaccinated.
A large protest against the health passports was held in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the Autonomous Community, a covid certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightly entertainment venues.
The decision to introduce health passports was made by the authorities of several regions of the country against the background of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with the police.
A group of demonstrators started throwing stones at police officers.
Law enforcement officers responded by using water cannons.
Nikolai S., even on Wikipedia there is no consensus on this.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also designated as "the first Russian doctor, Doctor of Medicine," probably because she began her studies earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve the title.
There is only one thing I agree with Zakharova: the Americans have brought only death and plunder to any country, wherever they may appear.

WHO found omicron already in six dozen states
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that a new strain of the coronavirus "omicron" has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was reported by the WHO.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it began to spread actively only since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of spread of the new variant of coronavirus.
WHO experts fear that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may overtake the "delta" strain, aka the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is now leading in all countries without exception.
Previously, the director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus, stated that the Omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in Great Britain.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that Omicron will displace Delta in the coming months.
And the number of ill people only in Britain will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially "omikron" at the moment in the Kingdom a few hundred people, and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the Omicron strain, and at its peak more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals daily.
What the British health care system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the Omicron strain is 32 times lower than the other types of the disease.
How the Russian Sputnik V reacts to Omicron is not yet known - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing a Russian vaccine on the omicron strain.
Why do we need to see the stages of aging?

Or hands on the waist?
Curious Squirrel, you are right, communication on the Internet is quite different, communication is easy and relaxed, and when you meet in person there is nothing to say.

Once again, the Soviet period is called "the time of demons.
People believed in God much more honestly then than they do today.
We were brought up practically according to God's laws (love of neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What is the ideology today - money at any price.
Chatterers like Globa have little faith (or none at all), but even so, the time of demons came in the 90's...
Our St. Petersburg, or rather Leningrad, commune with Bolshaya Zelenina is still in communication.
Of course, we are not the closest of friends, but we try to preserve the warmth of the older generation's relationships.
Maybe this was due to the fact that there were no newcomers in the apartment, rooms were not rented, and no one cancelled the blockade brotherhood.
Unfortunately, we see each other more and more at funerals.
Lara Angelica, come on!
Human cubs, especially the male ones, are strong, agile energetic, frantic, pushing, wrestling, fighting, just like their little "brethren" in the wild!
The only pity is that they are not as soft as puppies or kittens, so bruises, bumps, scratches - the usual thing, but no boomerang!
And for what?
Did you push your brother, not calculating his strength?
Have you always been so smart that you've never accidentally hurt anyone and you've never hurt yourself?

This data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile application market in 2021.
In 2021, the world economy emerged from lockdown and began a post-pandemic recovery.
"Will such a "return to physical" growth of the application economy slow down? Not at all," according to the report's authors.
The leader in the number of app downloads was India: it accounted for about 20% of all downloads.
It is followed by the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of iOS gadgets, as before, spent more than Android users: iOS accounted for 65% of all spending in apps.
Among the applications, CapCut video editor ranked first in terms of downloads in 2021.

Telegram is also in the top 10 in terms of downloads.

Russians were warned about a new fraud scheme
Attackers began to look for new maneuvers to cheat in video messages.
This is reported by "Izvestia" with reference to experts.
According to Zaur Abutalimov, director of products for Ivideon, the main danger associated with the spread of video communications is dipfakes.
In this case, the scammers create a fake video based on real recordings of the victim.
Thanks to this neural network is able to accurately reproduce the characteristics of the behavior of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using a dipshake, attackers can call the victim's acquaintances via video link or create a video with a copy of the person to send out for blackmail.

For his part, Varonis leading systems engineer Alexander Vetkol noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this can create specific risks when it comes to technology using video.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized the fact that I bought all this in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow much makeup and walking in short skirts, showing stockings and pantyhose on the legs.

That's how it is in Dushanbe, it's a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are a lot of fashionistas, but the same cosmetics are missing.
Listed are five actions to help avoid diabetes mellitus
Problems with blood sugar levels are among the most common in the world.

Dr. Pavlova talks about "weekend migraine" in workaholics
Several factors can make you feel worse on the weekend
The reason for the deterioration of health after the working day is often a "weekend migraine," said a well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, a senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine at Moscow State University, scientific director of the Clinic of Systemic Medicine Zuhra Pavlova in her Telegram channel.
According to her, workaholics are particularly often affected, with headaches, brokenness and weakness on the weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the fatigue accumulated during the week, there are many objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to changing conditions.
During the weekend, our lives change drastically.
"We sleep long hours, we lie on the couch all day, we probably eat more and drink less," the doctor argued. - The lack of coffee causes a little withdrawal.
Overeating and lack of water make you feel heavy and broken.
Late rise plays an additional role.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction called jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which factor plays a decisive role in the deterioration of health, Pavlova recommended tracing what changes the most during the weekend.

South African Scientists Declare Low Efficacy of Pfizer Vaccine Against Omicron
South Africa says Pfizer vaccine against omicron is not effective
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported low effectiveness of a Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
It (omicron's neutralization rate) is estimated to correspond to a (vaccine's) 22.5% efficacy rate against symptomatic infection, which makes it ... the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection is questioned," according to the text of the study published on MedRxiv.

How much hidden sugar is in familiar foods?
Sugar is not the best source of healthy nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular disease and cancer.
Consumers should be aware that under an unfamiliar word in the composition of the product may be hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calories, composition and glycemic index.
Several dozen names may appear on the label, essentially denoting sugar.
Some of the most common and common names are glucose and fructose.
There can also be other torn sugars such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black treacle), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates, which are mono- and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery products, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and unprocessed foods, as well as to pay attention to the label and the many different names of sugar.
Different kinds of sugar vary in taste, but no matter what the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it is still sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, because it is necessary to consider not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be much higher than what is listed on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
Germany's new Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said that gas imports are becoming less important for Germany as the country continues its transition to decarbonizing the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil, and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is to say, in 25 years' time, the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role," the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany remains committed to ensuring that Ukraine transports Russian natural gas in the future, as this resource is essential for the energy transition at this time.
He recalled that Germany and the U.S. made a statement in which Berlin's support of Ukraine's energy transformation was recorded.
Earlier, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany Annalena Berbock stated that the process of certification of the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the minister, as part of the coalition negotiations and discussion of the coalition treaty, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline does not yet "comply with the regulations" of the European Union.
Thanks for the interesting photos!

In a referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on December 12, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced at noon on Sunday, December 12, the majority of New Caledonians voted during the referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results released by the local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) of those who voted "for" the independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "against".
Turnout was 43.90%, with a total of more than 80 thousand inhabitants of New Caledonia took part in the elections.
As France-Presse commented on these midterm results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt," as supporters of independence urged voters not to vote.
As initiators of the referendum, they opposed it on December 12, considering that the new outbreak of COVID-19 in the archipelago prevents a full and "fair" election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for a third victory for supporters of French New Caledonia, following referendums held in November 2018 and in October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence; in 2020, 53.3% voted against it.
As stated by the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
According to the Elysee Palace on Sunday, December 12, French President Emmanuel Macron is to speak on the results of this referendum.
The topic of New Caledonia's independence has greatly enlivened the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates have argued in favor of keeping the territory within France because it is "the last region of European Union presence in the Pacific.
"New Caledonia must necessarily remain French," Eric Zemmour repeated several times.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate ValÃ©rie Pecress, who published a column in Le Figaro in late October urging Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility."
Nevertheless, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia.
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire that the choice of Caledonians be the choice of France.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that epicenter of this earthquake was located in 231.8 km to the North-East from Severo-Kurilsk town.
The source lay at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded a magnitude 7.5 earthquake in Peru, in which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing a new generation of jet drones
The new Ukrainian-Turkish factory will start producing ANKA-type unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
This was reported on December 11 by Oleksiy Arestovich, a freelance adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president's office.
That is, they are able to act against aerial objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aviation.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the hull and the like," he was quoted as saying by Dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA, Arestovich said that we are talking about jet, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is the new generation of drones after the Bayraktar, which exceeds it "in all characteristics.
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been conducted by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the united forces in Donbas.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky announced that the construction of a plant to produce modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, the Bayraktar Savunma company and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a center in the Kiev region, where personnel will be trained, as well as testing and maintenance of Bayraktar Turkish UAVs.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum "a big real step forward.
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport
Lions escaped at Singapore's Changi Airport.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two raptors managed to escape from a container of seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the fleeing lions had settled down on the roof of the container.
The animals could not get away from him because of the protective netting set up next to him.
The confrontation ended when Mandai Wildlife Group, the organization in charge of all Singapore's zoos, arrived at the airport.
They immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to take them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its master and roamed the streets of the city.
The same day the animal voluntarily returned home, people were not hurt.
Experts warned about the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies suggest that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned of this.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who are not deficient in folic acid are less likely to get certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.
However, in contrast, exceeding the required dose promotes the growth of cancer cells.
University of Alabama at Birmingham nutritionist professor Beth Kitchin advises keeping track of the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if you deviate significantly from this figure up or down.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 tablets without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to watch the dosage and avoid cereal with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Because it, among other things, is found in avocados, Fine recommended that men after age 50 eat this fruit more often.
About 75,000 people could die in the UK by April because of the Omicron strain
British scientists predict that up to 75,000 people could die in England over the next five months due to the spread of the omicron coronavirus strain if restrictive measures are not tightened over the winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper with reference to the study of experts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts who are members of the Scientific Advisory Panel on Emergency Situations to the British Cabinet, by April 2022 in the country will record at least 25 thousand deaths due to a strain of Omicron, and only about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the disease, hospitals will admit more than 2,000 infected people daily.
"Serious coronavirus control measures may be needed to keep the National Health Service from being overwhelmed if the omicron strain proves to be more contagious than the delta variant and current vaccines fail to eliminate infection," said LSHTM mathematician Roseanne Barnard.
Earlier, the U.K. Health Safety Agency informed: if the rate of spread of the Omicron strain continues at its current level, by the end of the year, there will be about 1 million cases of infection in the country.
The Omicron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom by mid-December.
So far, 1,898 cases of the Omicron coronavirus strain have been detected in the UK, of which 633 have been detected in the last 24 hours.
In this case, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health Sajid Javid pointed out that in reality the figure may already reach 10 thousand cases.
I wanted to write a clever comment, but I read it all the way to this point:

Demand for superyachts in the world grew by a quarter
Superyacht construction this year and orders for next year are breaking all records around the world, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and fight climate change.
The number of yachts ordered in the world ship registry was 1,200, a quarter more than last year.
In an era of fighting the effects of climate change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it's hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for $50 million pounds or more won't decrease, writes the Guardian.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say there hasn't been such a rush in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a boat fear infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic aboard their own ship.
The second cause is also related to coronavirus.
If before all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the vast majority of them work remotely and negotiate by zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the paper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more just to have their yacht ready at least a year or two sooner.
"People just crave freedom, and the super-rich could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, don't want to understand that in times of deprivation, traveling into space, living on yachts or flying their own planes is irritating to society because the elite don't want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and suggest new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, although they realize that with so much mobility of money, it will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, it is only the number of superyachts ordered that impresses, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 ships, 27 have a stern length greater than 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building the 183-meter REV Ocean yacht.
Once launched, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "moon pool" as well as a submarine designed to explore the sea depths.
Helicopter pads, outdoor movie theaters, and a martial arts platform on some of the existing superyachts have become common.Richard Wilk, a professor of economic anthropology at American Indiana University, says that compared to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has symbolic value, given that there are just over 2,000 multibillionaires in the world.
This is just another example of over-consumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than that of the average person on the planet.
While one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the planet's biggest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
In doing so, two-thirds of the emission footprint came from his 162.5-meter yacht Eclipse.
Even if the owner is not on board, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and have him bring the yacht from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean, for example.
Superyacht owners do not evoke the sympathy of others when they, like Australia's richest woman, Gina Reinhardt, who owns mines on the continent, complain via YouTube that there is no room for their giant vessels to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships over 50 meters.
Dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to colon cancer identified
American scientists have determined what volume of alcoholic beverages per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
The Daily Express writes about it.
Experts concluded that drinking four or more servings of alcoholic beverages a week is associated with an increased risk of cancer.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with increasing amounts of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, men who drink moderately have a higher risk of colon cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of this type of cancer, noting only that certain factors lead to a detrimental process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or rather all, dog lovers believe that these creatures are very intelligent.
But even they have no idea how advanced the four-legged pets really are.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how intelligence is developed in animals.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study proves that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' work was published in Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or write poetry, they know nothing about politics, economics and art, yet they often manage to fool their masters.
Representatives of some breeds, according to experts, show better results in understanding the words of human language, but statistical data for accurate conclusions is not yet enough.
Thus, some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses - Labradors, for example.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and on the ability to learn is not inferior to a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine, the U.S. and Russia are getting ready to bargain
The U.S. and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine joining NATO, analyst Aleksandr Kochetkov said in an article for Glavred.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue talks in the near future about the United States' guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite U.S. leader Joe Biden's words about the right of countries "to join anywhere."
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you would not bargain, but simply send the offerer away.
And with regard to Ukraine there is a bargaining chip," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"The preparations are conducted covertly, quickly and immediately proceed to offensive actions, instead of waiting for the group to be discovered and counterforce deployed," he said.
China encourages the development of the rail transport industry
Advanced Chinese technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Rail and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition 2021, held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province /Central China/.
Key technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, said Hou Zhaowen, a company spokesman.
The high-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which went into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and operability of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased its exports of rail vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing "Chinese speed.
In May of this year, the first double-decker high-speed electric trains developed in China for export to Europe rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railroads of Austria, Germany, Hungary, and other European countries.
In November, the subway train developed by the company for Turkey began trial operation.
The train will run on the subway line between downtown Istanbul and the city's airport.
Traffic on this subway line will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest subway line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"China's railway equipment industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Feng Yaoxiang, head of the trade and investment department of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade /CCPIT/.
"This industry constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese high-end equipment manufacturing in the world market," said Feng Yaoxian.
After more than 60 years of hard work, through a series of independent research and development, China has established an advanced railway equipment manufacturing system, with a full range of support facilities and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoxian, the country ranks first in electrification of railroads and in operating mileage on high-speed and urban railroads.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Semyon Golosheikin, candidate of biological sciences, in a conversation with Radio Sputnik, listed the early signs of dementia.
Signs of future dementia, he said, could include forgetfulness as well as a range of moderate cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, planning, and reduced abstract thinking.
There is an ongoing debate that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for it, the specialist said.
Golosheikin emphasized that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of cerebral vessels are the most common causes of the syndrome.
Biologist noted that to date, physicians do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, learning foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, and regularly exercising cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intense engagement of memory and logical thinking
"There are recommendations on the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still debated in the scientific community," Golosheikin said.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining moderate levels of physical activity and regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive engagement of memory and logical thinking," Golosheikin said.
Earlier, a dementia research charity in the UK stated that the disease is increasingly affecting people over the age of 40.
Medics named early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign can be considered visual problems, due to which the patient becomes difficult to recognize objects.
Another sign of developing dementia experts called aphasia - a condition where a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
A neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent abroad for treatment
Former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili needs psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is a member of the panel of doctors created under the Ombudsman of Georgia, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is the leading one in his illness.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, changeability of character," said the specialist, noting that this is not beyond the normative limits and now the ex-president should be sent to special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psycho-rehabilitation, the possibility of which we have not found in Georgia," Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began sabotaging medical care after prison officials disciplined him.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to have his sentence lifted and regained his former rights.

Protests against COVID passports took place in Spain
Protests were held in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate, Europa Press reported.
In the Catalan capital the number of participants in the action was about 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory to go to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment venues.
Many protesters came to the rally without masks.
With slogans on their posters they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for citizens' choices.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required for entry into entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in that city declared a medical dictatorship, and called the vaccination an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified since the beginning of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia also plans to impose restrictions on the unvaccinated.
The bills on the unified system of QR codes the government submitted to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to attend public events, cultural institutions, catering facilities and retailers with either a certificate of vaccination or a previous illness or a medical certificate of exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for train and air travel.

Steep Climbing: How the Chinese Become Skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create resorts of international level in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to engage in winter sports, which will allow to collect the 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but will also contribute to the economic development of the backward provinces.
The Taiwu ski resort in Zhangjiakou, close to the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to building infrastructure in the region, landscaping work is also underway: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are big enough to host international competitions.
Many regions in China where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, have problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting vacation at Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, there is still a long way to go.
Games advisor Justin Downs says the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
Every year, more and more Chinese go to the slopes in winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite major changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, says Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions are yet to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation should be created there.
Gao Makong, 70, lives in Chunli, not far from the Winter Olympics venues.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railroad was built from Beijing to Chunli, and now none of the locals are out of work.
More and more stores selling winter sports apparel and equipment are opening in the country.
On the slopes open catering outlets with national cuisine.
There is even a COVID-19 test station on Tyva now.
China aims to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes to become leaders in major international competitions, and its resorts and equipment to reach world-class levels.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty because of pandemic, WHO says
More than 500 million people around the world could be pushed into extreme poverty because of a coronavirus pandemic that has stalled human progress toward universal access to health care, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
On the occasion of International Day of Universal Health Coverage on December 12, WHO and WB published two complementary reports.
In them, they stated that the pandemic had led to disruptions in the delivery of health services and caused excessive strain on health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage decreased and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria increased.
The WHO and WB stressed that the pandemic caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it became more difficult for people to pay for treatment.
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their own pockets.
In October, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres declared that the coronavirus pandemic had plunged more than 100 million people into poverty and that more than four billion people had little or no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister cut off from broadcast at "Summit for Democracy" at White House request
Taiwan's Digital Minister Audrey Tan's speech at a panel discussion during the U.S.-organized "Summit for Democracy" was put into video-free mode, a YouTube recording of the summit shows.
Reuters, citing sources, claimed that the picture was disabled at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was the map on which Taiwan was highlighted in a separate color from China, which considers the island its territory.
The map Ms. Tan was showing was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world in terms of civil rights.
Taiwan was marked in green as "free," while China, North Korea, Laos, and Vietnam were marked in red as "closed.
After the minister showed the map, the picture from her side was replaced by a screenshot with a note that the panelists' opinions "do not necessarily express the position of the U.S. government."
The PRC was not invited to the Summit for Democracy.
Reuters sources note that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister may have gone against Washington's "one China" policy.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map was displayed, the U.S. National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
Organized by Washington, D.C., the Summit for Democracy took place December 9-10, with representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and philanthropic organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During Day Zero of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund to donate the money obtained through corruption to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council Yury Averyanov stated that the summit had an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese message.

SKETCHES OF A RURAL MUSCOVITE.
Don't lump it together - bad people happen, you may have a complaint against them about a particular thing...
But what does it have to do with the number of children, age, pension fund, and so on?
Write that they are "bastards, they didn't return the money".
And it's none of your business how many kids they have and when, as long as they're not going to hang them around your neck.
And since it is excluded, what right do you have to judge them?
I guess it's only in education...
Chosen (by themselves) parents dictate their own rules, blatantly ignoring those that already exist.
What if this were to apply to other areas of life, the judiciary, etc.?
The laws are not written for them.
What if Dad does implement his method of parenting and education?
It's creepy and a very bad example for others to follow.

Foreign Ministry told about "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the U.S.
In an interview with Izvestia, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov assessed the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of interaction has led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
The one-sided negative predictability is there, but in terms of some prospect of improved relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
It's a sad conclusion from the long journey we've been on with the current administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems did not begin yesterday," the diplomat pointed out.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the desire of the U.S. to impose its approaches on Russia on a variety of issues.
The deputy foreign minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improved relations and would not expect Washington's position to change.
He explained that with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity, there has been no progress.
However, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, during a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Moscow was ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warns of dangers of COVID nasal vaccination outside hospitals
People who have been vaccinated with COVID-19 nasal vaccine may have allergies and need medical help, so the first vaccination sites should not be located in airports or shopping malls.
This was reported to TASS by Sergey Netesov, a virologist, corresponding member of RAS, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology at Novosibirsk State University.
It's easier to set up nasal vaccination points in airports and shopping malls, but I would only do it in medical facilities at first.
The fact is that there is a probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small, but it is desirable that the person after that sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special anti-allergy drug kits that work literally in a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping malls when there is experience in using the drug.
He also emphasized that when nasal vaccine is used, it is important that it gets to the mucosa in the nasal cavity.
However, there is a chance that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the vaccinated person blows his nose after the injection when it is stuffy.

Attention, question - what is Klebo doing to the right of Bolshunov and how does he want to get on the track, if he was behind in the turn before the turn?
And the "best finisher" at 1.5 km and after 50 km are two different things.

It needs to be towed.
The owner of the MAZ explained that he was drunk and the driver was inexperienced.
And to him - how drunk are you?

Peskov warned of suffering for Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russian sanctions if "aggressive actions" against Ukraine continue, including because of the alleged "invasion" of the country.
"It is impossible to impose any kind of restrictions on Russia without suffering itself," the Kremlin spokesman said on the air of the Rossiya 1 TV channel.
Peskov claims that "everyone in the world understands this.
Earlier it was reported that the U.S. is considering imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a measure of last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to impose restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank German Gref is sure that this is impossible.

Residents of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on New Caledonia's independence, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to secede from France.
This was reported on December 12 by the French channel BFM.TV.
96.5% of those who voted against independence were against it.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the South Pacific archipelago supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were annulled.
The level of participation in the voting that day was very low: about 55% of the archipelago's residents came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is due to calls by separatists not to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, the region had already held a referendum on independence.
The majority of the inhabitants supported the archipelago being part of France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometers from the French mainland.
In 1853 France declared New Caledonia its possession.
About 270 thousand people live on the archipelago, the territory has a special administrative-territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia under which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice, two years apart.

WHO tentatively considers Omicron less dangerous than Delta
The World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively considers Omicron less dangerous than the delta strain of coronavirus.
At the same time, there is evidence of decreased vaccine efficacy in the new variant COVID-19.
As of December 9, Omicron has been registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and the significantly altered antigenic protein profile of the omicron strain suggest reduced vaccine efficacy against infection and transmission of the variant.
"Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it ('disease severity' - ed.) may be less severe than for 'delta,'" the WHO technical report said.
The organization notes that so far all reported cases of omicron infection in the EU have been mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster than the "delta.
In Russia, two cases of infection with the Omicron strain have been registered.
They were "previously immunized," the Gamaleya Center reported.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova stated that so far there is no reliable data that the new variant of coronavirus is less dangerous than others.

Ukraine named four scenarios for Zelensky
Former Verkhovna Rada deputy Vadym Denisenko listed four options for the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may be left without the support of the West, and possibly compromise on Donbass.
Denisenko said this on Sunday, December 12, in a publication on the portal "Glavred.
The first option, which Denisenko called "the perfect storm," suggests that key Western countries stop supporting Ukraine by reaching an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
This development will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"In parallel, there is a decrease in the prices of key goods that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and confrontation of the authorities with the key FIGs (financial-industrial groups - Ed.)," the ex-parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario - "war against all.
This prediction will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this state of affairs, the Ukrainian leadership may make compromises on Donbass, as a result of which there may be confrontation within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will weaken; according to the former MP, the probability of such a situation is up to 50-55%.
The third variant of development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation between groups of people who disagree with Zelensky and the president, due to which the seizure of control over the power bloc and the implementation of "populist initiatives" are likely.
During this version of the crisis, Zelensky would begin "reformatting the government," Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the "father of the nation.
Some event could lead to this, which would be a great shock to society.
"The event must be large enough to cause a reaction from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a scenario is possible as a result of a natural or man-made disaster or aggressive actions by Russia, says the former deputy.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly denied any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it was the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the U.S. that were increasing military activity near Russia's borders.
Earlier, on November 11, the polling data of the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to an all-time low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest number since he was elected head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which in the next presidential election in Ukraine only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for ex-President Petro Poroshenko.
Only 19.3% of all respondents expressed support for the president.

I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kilograms straight from the melon field and not before the beginning of August.

A poet arrested for an action in Red Square: "They give 10 days in jail for quoting Yevtushenko, that's the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student of the Higher School of Economics was detained on Red Square with a poster with the hashtag #poetrossiyabolshechempoet on it.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A report was drawn up on Alexander under the administrative article on repeated violation of the order of holding a public action.
The first time he was detained was on January 23 on Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now the interest in it, unfortunately, lost, to the decline of the culture of common in Russia and so is a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag, "- explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to clarify the circumstances of his detention and to reveal in more detail the message of his message.
How were you treated by the police during your arrest this time and earlier?
What did they ask you in the department, how did they comment on your action?
This time the officers were more correct, detention as much as possible, polite, no matter how ridiculous it may sound in some context of the word.
On Pushkinskaya Street the riot policemen took him and took him hard.
Asked in the standard way, about motives.
When they heard it, in principle, they looked, if not approvingly, then understandingly.
With the exception of the monkey house blowing out to all four sides, everything was extremely correct, but I knew what I was getting into.
And if, after the action, at least a few people start writing their poems under this hashtag, I will serve these 10 days for a reason.

Researchers tell how potatoes help fight age-related disorders
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve circulation and lower cholesterol.
Root vegetables contain B vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic acid and pantothenic acid.
All of these elements help the body systems to function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Because of its high content of cellulose, it is good for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular consumption can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
For the greatest benefit, however, the root vegetable is better braised or boiled rather than fried in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other foods with a high glycemic index.
These are foods containing carbohydrates that break down quickly into sugars, such as sugar, sugary soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting the reduction in its production on private farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment can only be replaced by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from Yandex
Candidates for departure
In 2015, rights holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites on Runet and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, general director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks, among other things, to regular change of the domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in both Yandex and Google search results, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Squid Game" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan, the original series of Russia's largest video service ivi (part of the AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in the search engine results, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto", but judging by the quality of the video, it is a so-called screen shot (a pirated copy of the film made in a theater).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univer. 10 Years Later" by TNT TV channel (part of Gazprom-Media) is available on Filmix, which can also be searched for.
Svetlana M., I'm sorry, of course, but I wouldn't care if my son was offended for his mommy or not.
If we have some kind of misunderstanding going on, it's better not to get involved at all, sweep it in its own way.
It's good, of course, that this rarely happens.

Ludmila, China has advanced space technology right now.
Russia is already hopelessly behind.
"This idea developed by the Poles" - it would be more accurate to say that Poland only recycled the idea of 1776, but developed it quite effectively.
In fact, the slogan "The outskirts are not Russia" appeared in 1848.
Which, by and large, doesn't really change the point.
I watched her interview, the girl said that her biggest dream is to grow wings, her dad constantly tells her off.
Well, it's all kind of questionable.

Dimax Micro Ultimat mattress, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient because it has two different softness surfaces - high hardness and a little more than average.
The composition of the product includes only quality and premium fillers, which have proven themselves exclusively from the best side.
Springs: in the center of the model there is a block of independent springs "micropacket".
This means that there are 2,000 spirals per bed, which work fully autonomously.
It is their functioning that gives a unique point adjustment.
"Micropackage" is the highest frequency of the entire variety of spring units "Dimax", so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered a premium.
Fillings: Combinations of coir and natural latex layers on top and bottom of the springs.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
While one surface has latex, the other has coconut coir.
This tandem of fillers has long carried the status of a classic, because it gives the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
While the coir provides proper support for the back, the latex gives the surface adaptation to the human body.
Cover: The model comes in a quilted Aloe Vera knitted cover.
It can be made either removable or stationary at the customer's request.
The total height of the product - 27 cm, the recommended load on the bed - 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: the warranty period is 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents, which confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress is CertiPUR certified.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, The Actual Camera reported Sunday.
The purpose of the missions starting in five years is to assess the habitability of the clouds of Venus and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed instruments to measure the acidity and oxygen content of Venus' clouds.
So far it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the closest planet to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally an Earth-type planet.
On the third mission, a sample from Venus is due to arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question would be whether it is similar or different to life on Earth.
If very similar, it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, then perhaps it is more likely that life originated on Earth," said Mihkel Pajusalu, head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project.

Meta universes will change Russian business
The topic of meta universes became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would become a Meta.
For the market this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that business in Russia, as elsewhere in the world, will invest in the creation of their own meta-villages and their subsequent monetization.
Metavalleys should be seen as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend toward creating remote interactions is pandemic, because people are tired of being separated and restricted.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the desire of businesses to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models for them.
Thirdly, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are going digital.
Anya, you're right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you don't want anything too fatty or unhealthy anymore.
Of course we will have the traditional Olivier and herring under a fur coat for the holiday, but no one is forcing me to stuff myself with everything at once.
You can eat a spoonful, try it, and that's enough.
After all, there really are ten days off and you can make any delicious and healthy dishes.
And how much hell of work, time, and money it took for her to train.
And after performing five quarter jumps, she was left without gold.
And she also understands that she won't make it four years to the next Olympics, i.e. she will never be an Olympic champion.
And anyone who hasn't just played the sport or can't imagine all the circles of hell she's been through, DON'T GET CONSULTED.
British economist could not give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to give a forecast for 2022 because, in his opinion, such attempts would fail.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The coronavirus pandemic remains the most important factor, with inflation in second place, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the price increases were temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of endless central bank generosity is outdated" and it is time to return to a relationship where interest rates, taking into account inflation, will correlate with the expected rate of GDP growth.
O'Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, continued ultra-soft economic policy could, according to some experts, lead to another spike in inflation.
In addition, the issue of productivity growth should be addressed, as well as rising poverty and climate change, O'Neill summarized.
Earlier, Mikhail Shulgin, head of global research at Otkritie Investments, said that positive expectations for the dollar rate in 2022 remain, with less significant growth potential.
Among the risks to the dollar Shulgin named the Fed's monetary policy, the dynamics of oil prices and concerns about the pandemic coronavirus.
I have to agree.
But one thing is good: if you compare yourself to yourself, there were fewer containers five years ago.
It's better now.
There is progress, only sluggish.
Another problem is that there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people don't know about them.
All sorts of eco-taxis that pick up waste from the house.
It's a trivial recycling center - it's used by the marginalized.
It's rare to get glass and metal in there.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles to buy new cars, which is 28% more than during the same period last year, according to statistics from the agency Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale - about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
The Korean brand Kia is the leader in terms of revenues on the Russian market.
During the first 10 months of this year it managed to sell cars for 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than the year before.
Kia's sister brand Hyundai's growth is even more significant - more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
The brand is the leader in the increase in the weighted average price of the car - for the year in Hyundai it has grown by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - stronger dynamics of growth in price was only observed in Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time the sales of Korean brands have grown not so much: according to the statistics of the Automobile Manufacturers Committee of the Association of European Business in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars over the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Japanese Toyota is at the bottom of the three leaders in terms of sales in money terms - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles for cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has increased its sales volume (by 37%) and the weighted average price of a car (almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz has both good growth in sales and weighted average price - more than BMW, for example - hence more growth in financial capacity," explained Tatiana Arabadji, general director of NAPI. -
In terms of sales growth rates, Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year, are demonstrating fantastic performance.
Russian Lada shows the average market growth rate (plus 28%); Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles for cars of this brand in 10 months.
At the level of last year in terms of financial capacity are companies whose car sales in units in 2021 fell: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is even in the red - in the first 10 months Russians spent 12 billion rubles for SUVs and pickups of this brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Amid problems with automotive component supplies and production disruptions throughout the global auto industry, auto companies are constantly adjusting prices - Avtovaz raised the price of Lada models seven times a year, and the last price hike (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Other automakers also regularly rewrite the prices of their products.
The volume of the car market in Russia in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars contributed to this by inflation, as well as the desire of automakers to win back the past losses, experts say.
With the shortage of cars, I think many car companies have even been able to partially pass on to the consumer the costs of past periods, which they could not put into the price of cars before,
says Vladimir Bespalov, auto industry analyst at VTB Capital. -
I believe the automakers are feeling very good financially right now, maintaining high sales margins."
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of cars, which is observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert specifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantity and in money terms, but mostly due to inflation and the increasing complexity of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
As supply grows, there will be little room for price increases.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow next year, even if the growth in car prices slows down, the automakers will be able to get their income from the volumes, says Sergei Burgazliev, an independent consultant on the automobile industry.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, automakers are now striving to get the highest profit from each car sold, Burgazliev said. -
Increased production of cars is not expected for at least the next six months, and in Russia the excitement is also fueled by the uncertainty of citizens about the future.
Against the background of the current situation in the market cars were a good investment - bought a year ago, even with mileage, now you can sell more expensive than its original value, the expert said.
Biden speaks out about deployment of U.S. military to Ukraine in case of Russian invasion
U.S. leaders have never considered sending U.S. troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian "invasion.
This statement was made by U.S. President Joe Biden.
"There have never been any such plans," the White House chief said, responding to a reporter's question about whether the U.S. had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalates, Russia will face economic consequences.
He stressed that the U.S. and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using U.S. troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine was not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the U.S. will redeploy forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Hungary).
"We will have to send more U.S. and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow had no intentions to invade Ukraine.
At the same time, he said that Moscow sees the problem in Kiev's military use of drones supplied by Turkey and also in the fact that "U.S. weapons are approaching our territory.
I immediately leave such interviews.
If already at the interview they want to make me listen to shouting, wait for hours, drink incomprehensible crap and still wash the cup - it's scary to imagine what will happen at work.
I'll find a normal place for myself, without the layer of the HR, where you immediately talk to the manager.

If a scammer calls from such a number, like an "employee of the Interior Ministry" or another security agency, it is ineffective to reset immediately, and blacklisting is probably not enough time.
Because to confirm his lie about being involved with the security forces, he quickly repeats the call and continues to intimidate and persuade.
We need more useful recommendations for the people.
That's bullshit...
I don't believe it was like that at all.
They don't know what to think up anymore, who to blame.
The Queen has been reached.
And most importantly, in their opinion, everyone is to blame except the very, very best...
Wouldn't it have been easier to leave people alone from coercion, of course, if ours cared about its people.
Maybe all strains of the virus will disappear...
Like in Japan... Before the election, they loosened their grip and there were fewer infections...

As the regular friendly meetings between the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey show, I think you are, to put it mildly, out of touch.
Just yesterday, the president of Azerbaijan approved the opening of a joint Azerbaijani-Russian KAMAZ enterprise.
