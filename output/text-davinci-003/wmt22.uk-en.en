Good day, sorry I had no internet and couldn't send it sooner. Thank you.
Please tell me the exact address where to go for cleaning tomorrow, what is the code for the keys and what time tomorrow the guests will leave and the new guests will check in?
Unfortunately, I must decline your offer, as I have already found a job at this time.
Sorry, but I can't refuse there.
Sometimes it seems to me that my thoughts in Czech language differ from what I wrote in Ukrainian through a translator.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Good day, I agree to the course.
However, could you please tell me if there is an earlier time?
Because I don't live in Prague, there may be difficulties with transportation.
If there are no other options, I'm still okay with it.
Thank you in advance.
In Kharkiv people again went out to a rally, Russians didn't manage to disperse them.
According to the participants of the event, the residents of Kherson managed to hold a rally before the military personnel of the Russian Federation arrived with military equipment.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now the RF equipment has arrived," said one of the event participants.
Traditionally, the citizens gathered for protest rallies on Freedom Square - near the building of the Verkhovna Rada and the Cabinet of Ministers.
Currently, this square, as well as the building, is controlled by armed Russian troops who use weapons against participants of the rallies and abduct people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As reported by Ukrinform, in Donbas residents regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
Russian forces are using force and weapons against people who are injured and detained.
Also, Russian occupiers are abducting residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy bestowed the city of Kherson with the special title of "City-Hero".
On February 24, the President of the Russian Federation, Putin, began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian forces are shelling and destroying key infrastructure objects, conducting massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, rocket launchers and ballistic missiles.

Sasha was not in school today, I emailed the teacher.
Hiüëãüèª I'm sick, so it would be better to reschedule our meeting for next weekend, sorry.
I can cook, as long as I have a recipe, but I prefer to bake.
In Ukraine, borscht, varenyky, and other dishes are traditional.
I don't have a favorite dish, I love to try different dishes from different countries.
What are your food preferences? Do you like to cook?
I want to be something busy.
The train is more precise, but there are no seats.
Sorry, but we are a little late.
Lucy, can I help you in the kitchen too?
It's great that Julia will have the opportunity to go to work.

It's very cozy and comfortable there.
On Tuesday, Pablo will tell me if there is a job for Nazar at the brewery and when he should come to arrange a meeting.
If Nazar works from 5:30, he can take any train.
Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, if it stops fighting - we will have weak positions.
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the battles for the east of Ukraine, and in particular for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the Ukrainian forces suffer defeats there, the Russians may abandon the negotiations and again occupy the de-occupied territories.
Straight talk: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It beats - we fight, we are strong.
If it stops beating, we will have weaker positions.
They (the city defenders - ed.) - people who have drawn a large number of enemies to themselves.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the eastern part of the state, in the area of the ATO, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer to us and we will have advantages in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If the situation is weak in all these directions, then we may not be able to meet.
Because then Russia will be taking all these steps that could lead to the return even to those cities that we are now de-occupying.
They can go for it.
Then our situation in negotiations will be weaker and maybe even not interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we confirm.
We believe in our result, in our victory...
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to go to negotiations after the detention of Ukrainians, but "we must not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if they are with us".
Straight talk: "People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
Under our conditions, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something - and I don't think any peace on any terms will satisfy them.
But if we speak non-emotionally, war must end with peace, or it will end with millions of victims.
Even where there are millions of victims, everything comes to an end with the war.
So, we must fight - but for life.
You can't fight for nothing when there's nothing and no people.
Good day, do you have any more free spots for the Czech course for adults at 7 pm on Tuesday?

In connection with the change of the Ukrainian literature esthetics, new concepts were needed to describe its new qualitative state.
The analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
The use of Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows for an analysis of the postmodern context as such, where metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion.

Why did you believe that such an experience was not necessary for you?
Every situation is given for something.
Generally, people should change, especially spiritually.

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian military personnel who took part in the commission of military crimes in the city of Bucha in Kyiv region.
As Ukrinform reports, this is reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on Facebook.
"Every Ukrainian must know their names!"
The General Staff of Ukraine has obtained a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized infantry brigade, who are directly involved in the commission of military crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Bucha, - the statement said.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine states that all military criminals who committed crimes against the peaceful population of Ukraine will be brought to justice.
You can view the list by the link.
According to Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from Russian occupiers.
Massacres of civilians by Russian military forces have been recorded in liberated towns and villages.
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, announced that 280 people were buried in the brotherly graves.
General Prosecutor Iryna Venediktova announced that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were removed from the territory of Kyiv region liberated from Russian occupiers.
On February 24th, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the start of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure objects, conducting massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, rocket launchers, ballistic missiles, and air bombs.
Good day, I apologize, but I won't be able to work for you because I will be flying to Canada soon.

Just nice clothing at reasonable prices and with sizes available.
We were at the store at the railway station.
What professions are offered? Is it possible without language knowledge?
It is important if there is such a tradition, then I need to know so that I can prepare).
I thought it would be a week, but the situation is getting worse, the sirens are constant.
Tomorrow there may be bad connection on the road.
I am grateful to every person for the experience, even if it is painful.
I believe that I have taken away experience from each situation for myself so that I do not repeat mistakes in the future.
Directives are introduced in the form of numbered written supplements, which are part of this Regulation.
I'm sure there won't be a problem with this.
In Ukraine, many people are celebrating this week as well.
It depends on the religion.
Is a person Greek-Catholic or Catholic?
To start, you can try it for free.
Can you write us a payment algorithm, we will pay ourselves.
The paper that children receive at the end of the school year is a report card, and the certificate is received at birth and marriage.
Yes! He is an experienced driver on it! But I don't know if that's better. I'm worried about the walls of the apartment.
It is written that you need to fill out a census in Czech...
I will try to make it in time. I still have to go to the town hall to sign the documents.
Don't be mad at your partner for being on the phone
In my daily prayers, I thank God and the Blessed Virgin for you.
May they envelop you with the embrace of love and warmth of this night.
My heart belongs to you.
Would you mind if I come right after the war?
The place, day and time will be specified according to interests and possibilities.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
It's great, I have money for two months of rent, the district in Olomouc doesn't matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the animal attack on the civilian population north of Kyiv.
Photos of the massacred and shot people shocked the whole civilized world.
Dozens of people are infecting each other, how could this happen in the 21st century?! How?!
And nothing surprised me at all. Exactly what I was dreading and expecting is happening...
I evacuated the children and their summer parents from Kyiv the next day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with the children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have been consistently helping the U.S. and never doubted that in the event of an occupation, my family in the outskirts of Kyiv would not be spared.
I remain absolutely convinced that the essence of the rotten communist-KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror he simply cannot exist, he is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my grandparents was shot in the prison of the city of Zhytomyr.
Several years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU was given a copy of the grandfather's shooting case: the whole case was over a hundred pages, and the sentence for the execution was very simple and even more frightening.
The accused was silent, denying the guilt.
An ethnic Pole, Catholic, had five children, was from free people, a poor "one-village" gentry, never went to taverns.
The fact that they lived on the farms and had a few cows was enough to direct the shepherd and the shepherdess of the young children to the pasture.
Relatives didn't even find out about the burial place.
Grandma said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village then and all were killed except for two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the carnival case there is the surname of the drummer Sharie.
Our former speaker of the Supreme Council comes from the neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and I'm not surprised if his relative was a KGB informant.
An apple does not fall far from the tree, as is known.
The firing squad that was sent to the village were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing my grandfather's case, I became interested in various information resources.
There are excellent (without sarcasm) informational resources in Russia on the "Immortal Regiment" theme, which qualitatively remind of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVDists have found ways to punish and eliminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers - the system first discredited and then destroyed them.
Apparently, they found files with child pornography on the computer, so they put him in prison, and he quickly died there.
KGB agents are still killing those who try to uncover the truth about the crimes of the last century.
What are you suddenly surprised at their actions now?!
There is concentrated the most repulsive features of human nature.
Over the thousand-year-old ordynska tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th centuries were imposed.
Then, over what had come out, they conducted a beastly genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligence during several waves of red terror.
Watch the French-language film "Chekist" from 1992, that's how it was.
Have you seen my swimsuit photos?
Can you ask your wife what I can buy for a cough?
Sorry, I don't have anyone to ask.
I was wondering if you know where the children went, because Galya can't find them.
Lyubosh, Igor is asking if it is convenient for you to go tomorrow (he has a day off and can go, because they haven't looked at the car at the station yet).
We are very sorry to bother you so much.
You are helping us a lot, thank you!!
In Borodyantsi near Kyiv, during the clearance of the rubble of two multi-storey residential buildings, the bodies of 7 civilians were found.
Defenders of Mariupol reported the dispersal of an unknown toxic substance from a Russian drone over the city.
Three people were injured.
Approximately 1700 Ukrainian defenders and civilians are held in Russian prisons.
Among them - 500 women.
Germany will allocate 1 million euros to support the International Criminal Court, which is investigating war crimes of the Russian army in Ukraine.
Canada has imposed sanctions on 33 Russian defense sector companies.
In the battles in the east of Ukraine yesterday, one enemy tank, three armored personnel carriers, three artillery systems, 24 units of motor vehicles, one helicopter and three drones were destroyed.
Your coffee will arrive today.
I got my first bike after my brother.
When the girls return from school, what do they do afterwards?
We arrived at the place where we were settled from the center in Pardubice, the conditions were good.
But there is a big one here where people drink alcohol and smoke indoors, loud music is the least that "disturbed", the smell of cigarettes, drunk men and we with children ... it's scary to go to sleep if honestly.
Please help with housing, please for money.
But where it will be safe and not smoked.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is so strong, it's almost like they are smoking here.
I beg you very much, one of them is barely standing on his feet, he is screaming something, something doesn't suit him. It's very scary.
I'm just asking if you can help.
The main thing we understood each other
Very positive, such a wonderful garden, such pleasant teachers.
You do so much for us, it's incredible, very thankful to you‚ù§Ô∏è
Good evening Stefanie, Agatha wants to join the game, she has been missing the game üòâ
We don't reach that hatch
For now, we are not ready to pay such money, we will wait for help and then plan something.
How do I get to the apartment today to clean?
Will I be near the main entrance, do I have to inform you and will you open?
I wanted to see if I could make it somewhere to look at the cake for Karen.
I forgot to write to you, sorry.
Everything went very well yesterday.
We were talking about children with special needs and their education system in Ukraine.
When Mrs. Shakhova introduced me as an Fpoint employee, the first question was how they found the dog, how they found the mop.
Everyone is following the page on Facebook.
They asked me to send you greetings and to say that they are very interested in reading the news.
We will talk about people of Romanian nationality who have privileges in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if a child comes and the parents don't understand Czech at all, then after work I can help them in a phone mode.
I need to change the bed linen, 2 sets.
It suits me just on holidays.
I have free time, and we only go to the Easter ceremonies.

Danie enjoyed it very much, thank you for organizing.
So far, Nestor only has a cold, but Galinka's temperature is 37.7 in the evening and 38.
The line for General Chapka is moving very slowly.
Everyone has a chance.
The main thing is for love to be real and mutual.
I don't know how it is in Europe, but in our country people get married for various reasons, mostly for practical and mercantile purposes.
And I have a problem with this, if I don't love a person nothing will come of it.
So, we took her home and drove her aunt away immediately.
She was very very thankful, she was even crying.
I told her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
She said if it's possible there might be an old quilt and pillow.
But it's not mandatory. Only if there will be. I'm also very grateful to you.
I felt sorry for him.
They killed my best friend in front of him.
I had a lot of questions for God, why situations were happening in my life that just made me lose faith in everything.
Do small grocery stores work? I need to buy bread and other groceries.
I just decided to go and you made the arrangements.
This is so but we are not orienting ourselves in the locality and do not know where everything is located. We were looking for a supermarket today for an hour and returned on foot. Two pairs of shoes are not suitable, so two pairs of large size are needed.
Even now, I was thinking about you and you wrote to me.
Does your father only speak Russian or does someone else in the family?
Children can come to Vali and play in the living room.
Alright, let's take a risk then :)
I'm also glad to have met you.
I talked to Volodymyr about housing and he suggested that I look for it myself or wait until they find it. They also said that there are people living with us here who can help us find what we need. We need to go to the metro station museum, where there is an institution that helps find housing.
Because I'm small, I'll jump the barrier üòÇüôÉüòÇ
For some of their questions I didn't know the answers.
It would be great on Thursday if possible
I can't call the doctor yet because I haven't done the food license inspection yet.
But I can't call him because I'm out of money on my account.
I can't top up my phone because I don't understand Czech online banking and it doesn't top up from a Ukrainian bank card.
In the Vodafone app I can't change the tariff to have normal calls and internet nor top up my number.
I'm already losing my mind
Where price is not a factor, but the face... What did you mean by the title?
I'm embarrassed to be unemployed.
I just wrote that in school for the lesson.
Sorry for bothering you, I was just really stressed
That is closer to when they will leave the borders of Ukraine to know for sure that they will arrive.
Life is now in question for everyone.
Okay. Size for 10-11 years. But our sizes don't match. Everything needs to be measured.
I'm looking for everything for the home and for the child.
Thank the people who accepted me, I live in a hut, they always ask if I need something, but I'm embarrassed to say, I'm asking myself to find it.
I just got home and now I'm having breakfast :)
Please don't explain anything, act like I'm not here
It is impossible to answer without a resume sent.
I can't tell Mom that :)
And I really don't feel quite myself right now, that I couldn't keep myself from feeling before we left the apartment....As tonight....
May God grant Yura success üôè maybe then I'll go to bed right away and get some sleep.
I'll write to you anytime.
Hi. Susan, help me. I got a payment for March. Is it for both of us with Yuliya or just for me, I can't figure out why such an amount.
Sure, you can make copies of the passports when it's convenient for you :)
We have one of the best lyceums in the region in our village.
I'm already having fun talking to you, and even liking it üòâ
I turned to the shelter, they offered temporary housing for a week - two, but I need permanent housing where I could be with the child, and why there is less and less of it.
The flowers have bloomed. Everything is normal. Everyone is rested and very nice.
According to "European Truth", Welt writes about it with reference to sources in the Ukrainian government circles.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economics on Saturday.
The cost of 100 helicopters, including the training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As well as the Boxer BTR variant is offered for 1.2 billion euros.
At that time, as tanks in battle have to approach relatively close to the enemy's targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
According to Ukrainian government sources citing KMW's proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will be done on a round-robin basis.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers in the shortest possible time, and the trenches that have been formed will then be filled with industry at the next stage.
The first new helicopters can be delivered within 30 months after signing the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed until 2027.
And is this us in the first half of the day or the second half of the day together?
Thank you we will find out how to replenish the account and accumulate. I will write back to you. Thank you.
I'm going to work tomorrow without passing the commission, and when my doctor prescribes it, I will pass the commission correctly, did I understand correctly?
How can I now change my T-mobile tariff package to 4 gigabytes for 249 crowns?
Hello, I apologize. Do you need an employee?
You can mop the floor or wash the dishes.
I'm from Ukraine unfortunately I don't know the language, but I need a job.
I am young and active, I am 21 years old.
I agree to any job.
I speak Czech at a basic level, but I'm learning every day, so I think I'll learn everything I need to work without any problems.
I think I've talked enough today, it's probably time for you to go to sleep so you can work tomorrow.
If possible, I will take these pants for work. The size fits me.
You are smart and everything will be alrightüôè Rest, gain strength and sleep soundly!!!üá∫üá¶‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üáø
On her birthday, the cat tries to end her life by suicide on Karlov Bridge.
Did you manage to negotiate with someone?
So we wanted to solve the problem with the Easter card. We don't have internet banking, we don't know how to set it up. What do we need to do?
Who do we turn to when we live with a gentleman?
Always say goodbye when you go.
We can after 17 o'clock
Can I send the whitewash tomorrow to the apartment and hang it to dry in the garage?
Hi. Yes, I'll be waiting for you at 6 o'clock.
How long have you been studying this specialty?
If it were warm, that would be very good.
I submitted an online application. I'll try to go out after work today.
We are all good. We are coping with the cold weather, we have experience in Ukraine, we have gas but since it is very expensive, we are burning wood in the stove.
Good day, Lena, could you please tell me where the nearest stationery store is?
Tomorrow we are going to Prague to look at an apartment.
Everything worked out just fine
I must take Karinka with me.
I set the whiteness, came home and translated what was written on the table near the washing machine repair channel, can I wash or do I need to turn off the washing machine?
It says my status will change within 24 hours. But why? What's the joke?üòÇüòÇüòÇ
The former man cannot rest, he writes me poems (a real drama).
I wish that everything that officially binds us to him would end as soon as possible.
Thank you for something not really working out here
And we already have a product from berries
Sorry, I think I messed something up.
I didn't understand Czech so well then.
I must have made something up to myself.
Indeed, they go to school like this, three of them, because Galia and Svyatoslav study remotely and will finish Ukrainian school and get their diplomas in the fall. They need to apply to universities.
Could you please tell me how to get to the city center?
I will share my thoughts with you.
For me, marriage is a secret between two people who don't discuss each other with their relatives or friends.
A man and a woman decide the issues in their family themselves, especially without the involvement of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we are ready.
Why not try it this way?
I rented a car for 9 people, we will come with Mariana and your family.
How much time do you have? What time do you need to leave?
Yes, I'm happy to listen to jazz.
Thank you, I'm working with this application, we talked about it in Czech classes on Wednesday.
For the last four years, I haven't let anyone in, I've read a lot of books on philosophy and figured out myself.
When things get too painful, it's hard to trust.
But you have to try again, everyone goes through something that changes them forever, that's life.
Martin, we are already going to sleep.
Thank you for such a nice and fun day.
We all really liked it.
We feel like we are at home.
The children all evening told their fathers, all the grandmothers and grandfathers how nice it was with them.
Greetings from the girls! Best wishes from us for the holidaysüòâ
And where are we now?
I hope my son will come out of this meat grinder alive.
Let's go today, maybe something will be needed.
How to contact them to open the door?
Are there any improvements in overcoming the coronavirus?
I am very grateful for those who help people. If you can, please help us too. Find affordable housing.
We are now in Slapy and our friends have welcomed us for a while.
My family: husband, daughter 6 years old, son 11 years old.
The man has already found a job as a driver.
I am a masseur and a rehabilitologist looking for a job.
In order for the children to be able to attend school and for me to be able to work, we need housing close to civilization.
I just had to give in today!
Nothing. We'll wait until tomorrow. I didn't know even big stores would be closed.
Boiled cabbage is prepared like this: in a saucepan, dilute tomato paste in 0.5 liters of water 3-4 tablespoons of tomato paste - bring to a boil.
I put the stuffed cabbage rolls in the pot and pour the sauce over them.

How much money do I have on this number?

The branch in Hall No. 29 is specially designated for the submission and processing of applications for assistance, so there is a translator on site.
Lily has already been accepted to school but we will go to the teacher on Tuesday because I informed her today.
I'm sitting, wearing headphones on my ears, listening to music and thinking about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy üò¢.
I don't know, beloved, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I take it that we are together. That we are a pair.
I would say that there will be a lot of work after the war.
I'm not afraid that I won't find her there.
I can do a lot of things.
I'm not afraid that I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know what will happen with the housing.üò¢üò¢üòü
I need to get a food license inspection. Can I do that here?
Please indicate to prepare the apartment for 5 guests tomorrow.
Do I understand correctly that there are five places in the room with a TV?
Arrange and cover the sofa?
Can we stay with you until Mrs. Margarita finds us a place to stay?
Don't worry about it.
Not new, already used, but it is working but not needed.
Write the address in Czech, let's look at the map where it is from us.
I don't know how much free space there is, so I can't plan anything with the furniture. I finally want to see that apartment this week and then understand what furniture I need.
Sorry for taking so long to respond, it was a busy day, it's hard to adjust.
Is that enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, to have the chance to hug you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell you how you feel.
There is already a crib and a bathtub here for the baby, things have been found for the first time.
Don't forget that you promised to help me whenever you can, but don't forget to give back too.
I want to get a haircut called a cap.
Oleg is ill - fever and cough. It's better for Yana not to come to us so she doesn't get infected.
I'll only be a little bit later - around 8. Is that okay?
I don't want misunderstandings with you.
Because I'm hoping that everything will be alright!?
We didn't even talk about this with these excursions!
I understand how important this is for you!
As for myself, I'm silent (for me it's just an unattainable peak)!
How are you feeling today? üòÖ After the celebration?
Hi, sorry, I just woke up, slept badly
Sorry for disturbing.
I was worried that we had a bad start yesterday translating the test with Kolya.
I will ask Grigory Denisenko or Yoneshka if they can help me a little bit with mathematical concepts.
Can I be of any use to them?
If there is such an opportunity, I want to brush up on my math terms over the weekend.
Geometry is generally difficult, but we have to work with Cole to make sure there are no mistakes.
Thank you for the test tasks
We are also hoping for this
And she was very happy with any gift.
I would like to connect to the internet with my Czech number.
Yesterday at bus stop 402 I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is alone... her eyes are full of tears and sorrow...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we have agreed that we will be friends.
And yesterday evening I thanked God for this girl, because she was the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt mutuality.
The branch in Hall 29 is specially designated for the submission and processing of applications for assistance.
It turned out that I ordered a spare card
I'm just a simple person
So she wouldn't be disappointed that nobody came.
I didn't go. So, I figured it out myself. I can do it! Most importantly, you taught me how to turn on the oven.
Are you leaving the city for a long time?
A year ago at the Holocaust Memorial Center "Babyn Yar" in Kyiv we commemorated 80 years since the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babyn Yar.
I had the honor of speaking after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of "a common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We must defend this foundation - it is also part of our responsibility associated with our history.
If "evil demons of the past appear today in a new guise," he said, "then for us Germans there can only be one answer: never again!
The fight must go on.
Today Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of innocent civilians, starving the inhabitants of the cities it has blocked and letting them die of illness.
Russian troops are carrying out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the Babyn Yar massacre.
For over a month, Germans have been seeing this in the news in real time.
So, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, and also weapons, which until recently was unimaginable.
Germany is withdrawing the delivery of heavy weapons necessary for Ukraine.
"Never Again!" not only means to stand against fascism.
This means fighting by all means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities that are taking place in Ukraine.
I sing you a song tonight
We agree, arrange for the tour, and write when to be gathered.
Everyone was sick except for Lidia, there was a new strain of Covid among them.
Then I'll do it tomorrow
I use this ticket instead of a card.
Apologies for the delay in documents.
The ticket cost me 2000 hryvnias from the conductor.
Serhiy Sydorenko: Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a distant prospect.
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of those surveyed were "for" it.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the flight of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to decline, while supporters, on the contrary, began to increase.
After the start of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite Ukraine's support for NATO's entry and the help NATO provides in times of war, there are now many critics of the Alliance and its member countries for their late supply of weapons, refusal to close the sky, and unwillingness to "fight" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its aspiration for membership in the Alliance due to the position of the Russian Federation, if this can stop the war and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "Cursed Questions" together with the editor of "European Truth" we talk about how exactly the Alliance helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for, what the Alliance is criticized for free, why our prospects for NATO membership are closer than ever in history and why security guarantees that are discussed in negotiations with Russia can become another Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think about this?
I have a volt partner designated to review my application.
I submitted her through this mobile app
There is no visa, we need to go to the congress center and find out how to do it, because it was processed in Poland, there they did not give visas, but gave a permit.
We will definitely write to you!
Denis went out today in a good mood.
He agreed with the boy from Ukraine, whom he met yesterday, to meet near the school so that the boy could show him everything.
So I hope everything is alright with him
Because I don't like it, I don't have enough for long
It is reported in Ukraine that the Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine.
I'm leaving the children alone and waiting there for 3-4 years and then I'm going home because I can't leave them anymore.
Bring a brother with you at 6-7 o'clock
So, there was a sick heart.
I had genuine feelings for this person, but he acted not very properly and I left him.
After a while, he returned and asked me for forgiveness.
I refused him.
After some time he called to say that he had undergone a heart operation.
Asking him just to chat, I felt sorry for him.
I have been psychologically supporting him for almost half a year.
We have talked a lot during this time.
Then I started having problems at work.
His support also helped me at that time.
Mutual assistance.
And I thought, maybe I really need to look at him differently.
And he proposed to me to get married, and two days later he died.
God Himself decided our fate.
What does ready for marriage mean to you?
He only speaks Czech.
I wanted to say that I managed to find housing, and I am very happy about it ‚ò∫ now I have a place to live and a place to be with my child.
Should I have been reminded earlier?
After all, I helped to look after the children in the family.
Don't apologize. Just write which sentences you didn't understand.
I understand myself that the translator doesn't always translate the text correctly.
I don't know how to talk to the doctor, does she have to give paper?
It looks like the guests have forgotten, I put it in the closet.
You should probably go to sleep now so you can work tomorrow.
Can someone help, needed items for a woman size XS or S, height 165. Also for her daughters (8, 10, 12 years). Thank you.
That time in Lidl I bought two packs and mom bought two
That's very kind of you, thank you.
You lifted my spirits.
Alright, let's talk about something else, I'm not sleeping anyway, I'm getting more and more tired and I'm dreaming that they are bombing...
God never hurries, for He has all the time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I perfectly understand the value of unskilled work and understand that such work as I had at home in Kyiv I will not be able to have here and the money I earned at home I will not receive here now.
But I can't just sit and do nothing, because then all kinds of bad thoughts come into my head, so I have to occupy myself with some physical activity.
Documents are processed at the airport from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., at other times you can just wait.
Vladimir returned at 4 o'clock.
We took them with us.
We arrived with Vika in the kitchen, they put them in the bedroom.
I will finish my work and go to the Airport with them.
When he is with you, write and find out what's next...
But I can't find a place for myself
Sir, please, these are invitations for Ukrainian children who will be entering high school.
Well, but I'm doing it hard.
Okay, let me know when it's convenient for you üòò
I don't know about work yet. It would be nice if I could arrange for the children to go to kindergarten and school.
We had planned it that way. Would it be better if we changed it up sometimes?
I'm sorry. I really don't have any missed calls from the middle. Sorry, shall we agree on another deadline?
I offer a job, cleaning the bathroom and toilet, washing 3 windows, wiping the dust.
Work for about 3-4 hours. One-time payment of 800 UAH. From Tuesday, April 19th, at 14:00.
I hope I'm telling you that everything is good with us.
Can I call you?
Or can you write down your spouse's contact?
Grishko started coughing, I want to ask what I can buy at the pharmacy.
I want to ask for advice.
Here, Hanna is considered the original form of the name Anya.
Her uncle gave it to her from home.
We made an English version and added new partners.
Write to him if something is needed.
Please don't forget about me.
Are Monday and Wednesday classes different?
Thank you very much. You do a lot for our family! We are all infinitely grateful to you.
A pass is required to be in the pool.
But that's my opinion
My uncle gave her skates and a skateboard from home, so she skated on them at home, so this has to be it.
I also got up at 9 o'clock, and I'm only now preparing breakfast.
I'm very embarrassed that you are talking to me on your day off. I hope I'm not too annoying.
We would like to inform about the change of residence and at the same time submit documents for the extension of the card.
We are now providing medical oxygen to all the doctors in our country.
Oh, I almost forgot to tell you that there will be a snack tomorrow.
One mom said she would bake donuts with jam for the children.
He comes to you as a guest.
Could you please tell me if you have any approximate cleaning schedule for the apartments for the next month, at least for a rough understanding of which days?
I can't remember this schedule at all )
The Russian army is threatening to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say "we have never done this before"
Konashenkov's direct words: "We see attempts of diversions and strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian Armed Forces will launch strikes against decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, from which the Russian army previously abstained.
Russians have been launching rocket strikes on Kyiv since the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation's occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25th, the remnants of the Russian missiles, which were shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system, fell on a multi-apartment building in the capital's Poznyaky.
On February 26, a Russian rocket struck a high-rise building on Valeriy Lobanovskyi Prospect.
On March 1, Russians fired at a checkpoint near Babyn Yar, as a result of which 5 pedestrians were killed.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying towards the buildings of the Ministry of Defense near the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, fragments of the downed occupiers' rocket destroyed a house and a trolleybus in Kurenivka in Kyiv.
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential area in Vinogradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center in Vinogradar, as a result of which at least 4 people died.
Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klychko announced on April 13 that it is too early for residents of the capital who have evacuated the city to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still launch missile strikes on Kyiv, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ammunition on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning to carry out a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to blame Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army towards the civilian population.
On April 1 near Belgorod in Russia, an oil depot exploded, apparently as a result of an aerial attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local government of Belgorod announced that a "Ukrainian projectile" had allegedly fallen near the city.
Obviously, the elites in Washington and Berlin shudder at the thought that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky over Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much with them, but rather with their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and before crowds of thousands on the squares of the largest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky will not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he will convince the European people who elect those politicians.
And these words, this refined blend of strength, grace and time, gradually reach their goal.
While Biden is still categorically against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris and Brussels are against the acceleration of Ukraine's accession, the process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want us to be considered cheaters.
The money you collect should be given to people who need it more.
I can come to you and we can decide on the spot. I would like to help anyway.
The air is clean, that's a plusüòÄ
It says that I have the "Together for Two without Internet" tariff, I asked to make the internet instead.

But I will never stop loving you, you mean everything to me.
This loan is taken out by a financial consultant.
So it will take a few days.
Katya asked for the internet, can she be given a password?
I thought you and Milano didn't get along.
Then my husband will pick me up because today he has a car from the construction company where he works.
We are very happy and grateful that our Nika and grandchildren are under your protection!
Thank you very much for the invitation!
We also hope that after the war we will be able to invite you to Ukraine!
It needs to be cut into 4 parts.
One of these pieces can be used for 2-3 days, but it should be changed every year.
I'm interested in architecture and color.
I'm very glad that everything is okay with you.
Most likely, at 16:20, the concert will start at 6, and after it I will be free again.

I offer therapeutic massages, a rehabilitation gym for children and adults.
I am speaking Ukrainian, Russian and Czech intensively.
Contact: ------ would like to have an email so that the Czechs can write to you through a translator, SMS doesn't work here, they don't have a Ukrainian keyboard, and if they call, you won't be able to agree.
Do you really not want this price?
He helps people to see what they are worth and what they have to offer.
If you don't need a price list, I won't provide it.
Tell yourself how you want it, and I'll do it.
You didn't want to write to me today for some reason.
Don't worry, I didn't come to ask for anything.
More precisely - today I only ask for attention.
I have a lot to say today, so I ask for your patience.
Is your vision okay?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan purchases, vacation.
You have dreams.
You plan to buy that dress you saw yesterday in the mall.
Tomorrow evening, after work.
Your brain can't process this.
He is clinging to the old reality.
You call the job to find out if you have to work today or not.
You decide to leave the children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There is hope... it won't last long.
Now .... let's agree ... something will be.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where to go?? I have no one and nowhere.
I have 50$ in my pocket. We spent everything at home.
Many of our supervisors did not give us a salary for our work.
Where do I go? Who do I need? How do I provide for my children? Where do I live?
You don't have the ability to take many things.
You didn't take anything practical from home... you have to travel 1000 kilometers.
You don't know if you will feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you take the children around Prague.
And what next? Unknown. How much is that? Unknown. The children are asking for sweets. But you can't. It's too expensive for you.
And we don't have such an iron.
We have a choice - to stay there and call the children to danger, or to try to escape here.
She was very happy with the hearts and words that the children gave her when she came to school.
You should have called me when you arrived.
I will write to you in the evening
So, I only believe in God and entrust my life to Him.
I no longer have the strength for all this
I thought you had fallen in love with a Ukrainian girl and had no time for communication üòá
I have already gone through the menu and even placed an order
Would you be interested in joint activities with your Czech neighbors, friends, and community?
If so, what type and kind?
Please send a page with a visa or entry stamp (red with a date).
Without a visa for refugees, we cannot provide humanitarian aid.
Mrs. Libush, did you pay for these?
I can't understand.
You are doing so much good for us...
We are before you in a great debt... thank you!
So, I understand that this is very good.
Now I will send you a photo of the business card of the lady I am teaching English to.
So what will you write tomorrow, shall we meet or not, maybe your plans will change...
Good morning. We have enough resources. It would be so nice to know a person from Ukraine.
If you want, you can be with me after work.
Are you busy tomorrow? Don't you want to meet after 4:00 PM?
What are your general impressions from the first week?
Karina brought us the medicine yesterday and we are taking them.
I can work with bedridden patients and disabled children.
However, it must be noted that I only speak Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have that.
Can I offer you a favor for tomorrow?
There is only antibacterial gel there.
I can't say for sure, because I'm not very familiar with the city...around half past twelve.
What services/activities, in your opinion, are needed/missing for elderly people?
I don't know because I haven't received a text from the bank yet and I haven't taken out a bank card yet and my children deleted the bank's app, which really annoyed me.
Then please write to me how you will be traveling üôèüèª
Today we are joyful - our city Bucha has been liberated from the occupiers, our troops have arrived.
The enemy is clearing out - Russians are being searched for in basements and apartments.
The whole city has been replaced, the exchange work will begin.
And Ivan would have looked to see if something needs to be repaired or something else needs to be done.
Diana, how do you want it. Maybe he will be embarrassed, I don't know.
Panas wants to stay home, he says he gets tired of us and wants to be alone when we go somewhere without him.
We will bake a cake and do lessons.
These are small businesses that opened volunteer headquarters in their premises and shops.
These are the tractor drivers who actually go out into the field under fire, because it's time to sow.
These are the bus drivers who have agreed to go to the temporarily occupied territories in convoys today to deliver aid and pick up people.
These are heroic conductors who fearlessly go into the zone of military operations, calm and help refugees in the cars, and at peaceful stations help volunteers to load humanitarian aid into the cars.
These are the gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the first days of the war and patiently served the exhausted and nervous people.
These are the municipal workers who are under fire, collecting garbage, repairing water pipes and power lines to provide people with the necessary.
These are doctors and nurses who save people around the clock without complaint, and in their free time they volunteer, collecting medical kits to the front.
In us in Ukraine, the tears stop when there are little leaves.
Please tell me, what age of children do you mean?
Is 8 years old acceptable for my daughter?
I am looking for accommodation for us and my daughter for 3-4 days to come to the Czech Republic and submit our passports for visa processing to Canada.
There are a lot of people in the visa center in Warsaw and the online queue is not working.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's far away, it takes a lot of time to get there by train, it will be hard for the child.
She decided to look for accommodation in Prague or not far from it.
No, everything is arranged for us.
Where to put yesterday's appliances
But I can't change the password when I follow the link, because I get this error:
It was in the micro-wave, something was burning there.
In Ukraine, operators of the largest banks are always available to customers 24 hours a day and all questions are solved quickly :)
Well, we'll get used to the new realities.
It's very unpleasant for me and I want you to know that.
You can edit the post. Most importantly, it should be true.

In the evening I evaluate projects. After dinner.
Grishko will sleep tonight, he was crying a lot, and losing his tooth.
I'm on the phone with all my acquaintances from Lviv, many people have died.
Czech Republic started issuing visas after March 22, I believe.
Until that time - stamps were placed such and then these stamps were compared to the visa.
The Foreign Electoral District of Ukraine (FED of Ukraine) is an electoral district that combines polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of premises for voting in the embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises on foreign military bases, [footnote 1] on which Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DR Congo) are located. [1] The role of the district electoral commission for the Foreign Electoral District is performed by the Central Electoral Commission.
In the foreign electoral district, only nationwide elections are held: presidential and parliamentary elections and nationwide referendums.
Local elections in the USSR are not held.

Are you mad at me?
I'm going to take a picture in a swimsuit.

I wanted to say that I already connected a Czech mobile number.
For this I didn't need another device, I went to the O2 operator and they gave me an electronic SIM card which I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
Thank you. I'm very uncomfortable, I'm working on Sunday and I can't anymore.
You said that you have a broken washing machine. Take it for yourself. You also need it very much.
We don't have enough blankets, down blankets, plates. The children don't have pajamas and there is nothing to change into.
Good morning, I will be leaving at 10...please write the address again, the SMS got lost.
I don't want to torture either you or myself, I will somehow cope with it myself.
That would be good, but I know there were no free places there, and basically they are now all on schedule and teaching quite well.
Do you have a meat grinder to make mince? We have one, but it doesn't work.
May good come after Easter
Did your mom say something was wrong with you yesterday?
She can't tell them everything she wants, and not everything she understands what they are saying. But yesterday she came with a great mood after that fair.
Today I also went to school.
Today I saw Christina's mom, but she didn't even say hello.
These apples are very delicious, what kind are they?
Andriy Yermak, the head of the President's Office, announced that Russia is starting a "fake operation" regarding the weapons that are being transferred to us by our allies.
Ermak's direct words: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and strive to "beat" the arms supplies by any means.
For example, one of the latest hoaxes is the alleged destruction of the S-300 air defense systems transferred to Slovakia by Russia.
Prime Minister Edward Heger has already clarified this information.
What's next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. Name one of them.
They can launch fake news that Ukrainian soldiers are surrendering their weapons to allies, and she is massively switching to Russian army armaments.
I want to immediately warn about such fakes.
With the weapons in the hands of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the enemy is sent to the other world exclusively.
Sorry, I forgot to ask how much the garden would cost per month and will it work in summer?
Everyone is given strength.
There are many sad stories, believe it.

Maybe your father told you that there are witnesses of Jehovah among us, but I don't profess any religion.
She was baptized in an Orthodox church.
I respect all religions, the foundation of which is love.
I have read the Bible, the Quran, and started reading the Torah.
I believe that there are no intermediaries between a person and God.
One might think about not putting the refrigerator near the doors in the boys' room.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage at the emergence of evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine, while Moscow has dismissed these reports as "provocation".
"Reports of those killed, abducted and severely injured by Russian forces of Ukrainian civilians deserve condemnation," said New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to journalists in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the incidents "violations of international law".
The statements were made after reports that hundreds of innocent civilians were shot and thrown into mass graves or left in the streets of the Kiev suburb of Buci by Russian troops who had occupied the area for several weeks.
Photos that seemingly depict the bodies of civilian victims with their hands bound shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
French President Emmanuel Macron stated in a radio interview on April 4th that there are signs that Russian forces have committed "war crimes" in Buchi.
"What happened in Belarus requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be directed at Russian coal and oil exports.
The Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez, has stated that Russian forces could go so far as to commit a "genocide" in Ukraine.
"We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," said Sanchez in Madrid.
Appearing on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Minister Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as "provocation".
She claimed without evidence that the United States and NATO "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts in the one who "ordered" this story," said Zakharova.
Earlier, the Russian Ministry of Defense also claimed without evidence that the image of Buchi was "another setup of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow has asked the UN Security Council to convene on April 4th to discuss what it has called "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
The Russian Investigative Committee on April 4th released a statement announcing an "investigation" into accusations of Ukraine spreading "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian forces in Buha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing a "genocide" in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Buzha to see what their military had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out," Zelensky said in a video address, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is shared responsibility.
"For these murders, for these tortures... For the shots in the back," he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held accountable for the actions of the military in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don't understand," he said about the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a town about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
On April 2, a correspondent of the Ukrainian Radio Liberty service saw on the streets of a small town what appeared to be civilian bodies.
The correspondent only saw up to 10 bodies on the street in one place.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various places in Buci.
The bodies of a group of nine people - all in civilian clothing - were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to the words of local residents, was used by Russian forces as a base.
It appears that the victims were shot at close range.
In general, the Ukrainian government has stated that at least 410 civilian bodies have been found in the Kiev region, which was controlled by Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, we have everything, we bought everything on the list.
They were told: "Kyiv is gone". As the occupiers forced Ukrainians to be deported to Russia and Belarus.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible words: robberies, looting, murders, tortures.
There is one more item in this list for which there is currently significantly less information ‚Äì the relocation of the local population to the enemy's territory.
Approximately from the middle of March, Russian occupiers are "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their own territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko has effectively handed over to the Russian military training ground.
"Ukrainian Truth" has tracked down the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to investigate how the "evacuation" itself is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text arrived at a voluntary-compulsory evacuation beyond the borders of Ukraine under psychological pressure and without a way out.
Fortunately, they are alive and maintain contact with their families.
Nevertheless, according to the statements of the Ukrainian government, many citizens were forcibly deported to Russia and Belarus.
So in Melitopol, the Russians stole the staff of the second boarding house, took away the children without their parents, among them 12-year-old Myroslava, daughter of the killed Ukrainian swimming champion Yosyp Zachepynsky.
Alexander's family, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Valya moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at the "Antonov" airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of a military town, although it was civilian.
Like true pioneers, Denis and Marina had already gathered their anxious bundles, but they didn't manage to evacuate by the morning of the 24th of February.
They didn't have their own car, and the local buses were already not taking anyone.
Around 12 o'clock in the afternoon of the 24th of February, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first missiles.
One of them hit the neighboring house.
Then the family descended to the basement and stayed there for three long weeks, until March 17, until the Russian troops took them to Belarus.
About 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 o'clock in the evening of the 24th of February, people entered the lobby who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They ask: "Is anyone there?" - I say that yes. - "Come out!"
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, if there was any weapon.
All men were asked if they had served in the army.
The women were told, "We have come to protect you by order of Ramzan Kadyrov."
This was a Chechen OMON, not even an army, young men aged 25-35.
They said: "Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sasha White (commanded the UNO-UNSO "Viking" battalion, which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day they asked what we are lacking.
We said that there was a big problem with the water.
They broke into the store, took the goods under the pretext of "the Russians will take it anyway" and brought us 6 bottles.
There are still videos on the internet where children thank Kadirov for food.
So after they robbed the store, they brought sausages and said: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one particularly wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child said there: "You have 7 days to return our phones" - they laughed.
They constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they had come, because they didn't want war, they support Ukrainians and are generally good: "Putin is a monster, Kadyrov too, but we can't do anything because our families are there".
And mainly they did not fight, but they went to rob stores, to maraud.
They brought a cow, tied a George's ribbon to one of its legs, and their own white tape to the other, and called it "opolchenka".
They arrived in Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their reconnaissance worked... When they were beaten at Buchi, so that they didn't even take away the dead, they asked us: "Do you have any artillery?"
What's more, we had segregated enclosures - the Chechens didn't know each other, in the first days they asked passwords to identify whether they were their own or someone else's.
They were with us until March 13th, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Omsk desant.
They set up 30-40 units of equipment between the houses - we constantly got into it from "Bayraktar".
But they came and told us that there is no ZSU anymore, but there is "Azov", and, according to their words, there are a thousand "Azovs" in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kiev has already surrendered" has been circulating since the beginning of March.
Somehow a Russian - either a paratrooper officer or a representative of the FSB - came to us and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we heard the radio - there was something about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought maybe they would give us a "green corridor" too.
From the very beginning, we sent our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
They tell us: "You will be deported to Belarus, and then, possibly, to Rostov".
We say we don't want to go either way.
They answered: "Take care of the mental health of your children!"
How it worked: they would take us to the basement and start shooting from under the house - either with "Grad" rockets or with mortars.
Then it flew back... The neighboring houses just burned down, part of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct entrance on the third floor.
Later they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Part of them didn't go, saying that it was for the traitors of the homeland - saying, "they will shoot you there, and sell your organs".
We drove through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were ruins, broken equipment, although the Belarusians said that the Russians immediately take the equipment away from them.
A lot of tankers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian border crossing "Komar" we went through an improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned.
We were placed in Red Cross tents and given tea.
And here we hear shots! A rocket is firing, and we can see the trail - it was "Iscander" working over Kyiv.
Though these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, those are planes flying, unfolding at the border".
But we have aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded into a bus and taken to the "Chonky" sanatorium near Gomel.
His supervisor, Hungarian Vasyl Stepanovych, came and said: "Here I am, I'm from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until they crush your thieves.
The poor people suffer!
And we have such a good Lukashenko!
He will do as he says.
They offered to give an interview to Belarusian journalists, but nobody wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "You are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and UN representatives (at least that's what they were called) spread disinformation that men cannot travel to Poland.
Many people believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we still decided to go, even though we had a problem with the documents - my daughter didn't have a foreign passport.
We were supposed to get him on Monday, but the war started on Thursday.
At the Ukrainian consulate, they didn't help us at all, and at the Minsk station they said that no one would take anyone on the bus without passports.
Here I will say that we were greatly helped by Belarusian volunteers.
We were settled in Minsk and were accompanied.
They couldn't stay at the sanatorium.
Our second group's migration representative said that you can stay here for a maximum of one to two weeks because Belarus is not Europe and there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
Passing by Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw launches of ballistic missiles towards Ukraine: the rocket first takes off, beautifully shines, and then fades away.
People who were on the bus in Mozyr reported that Russians are constantly shooting from the polygons there.
But I can say that Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals are being discharged from the army.
A woman told us that she would break something if they called her son.
However, in the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is located, they don't believe at all.
They say: "You lie, we are a peaceful people".
They do not understand that their polygons are used for shelling Ukraine.
In Poland, we were waiting for friends who would take us to Estonia.
We are currently registering and deciding what to do next.
In Estonia, there are probably as many Ukrainian flags as Estonian flags now.
Marina lived on the territory of a military town in Gostomel with her brother's family - his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
Early on the morning of February 24th, she called her relatives and asked them to gather the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to sleep in the basement of the neighbor's house.
Marina herself could not return home and in principle cannot - the house is no longer there.
Nobody knew anything about the evacuation.
Can't you somewhere in the center on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything. And we always welcome you as a guest!
Thank you for the agreement, lovely butterflies.
And in this small apartment there is no Wi-Fi, mostly I answer all your questions, but now I don't know what to do? And the children have online classes from Monday, but there is no internet.
So I will be living with two women from Ukraine and their children? Is this a family that is ready to accept us?
The Quran states: "Even a leaf falls from its tree with His knowledge."
Our children are learning online, I am a salesperson and a cook by profession, but I can also work in the field and as a cleaner, so I am a versatile worker. Mariana is a specialist in eyelash extensions and she can work from home, while the other Mariana has no speciality, so she is a versatile worker.
Can we agree on the best way to do this?
On April 1, the mayor of Buchi, Anatoliy Fedoruk, announced the joyful news - Ukrainian troops on March 31 liberated the city from Russian occupiers.
The next day the occupiers were expelled from the entire Kyiv region.
But the joy that Ukrainians would have felt at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, as it became known at the same time that in the city of Buchi alone, Russians had shot at least 280 peaceful inhabitants.
They were killed simply on the street, some had their hands tied and were shot in the back, some of the killed were underage.
The bodies and traces of torture were found of the village head of Motyzhyn, Olha Sukhonko, her husband Ihor and son Oleksandr, who were kidnapped on March 23.
Olga and Oleksandr's bodies were in a brotherly grave, Igor's was in the sewer.
On the tracks 20 km from Kyiv, the bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a shroud were found.
Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, there will be nobody at home
I ordered a package from Germany using DHL.
Yesterday they were supposed to deliver it to me, but nobody contacted me and the package was not delivered, and on the DHL website it was said that the recipient could not be found.
They sent the package to the post office and indicated the address of this branch.

She is very disrespectful and somewhat irresponsible.
She will forget her stop, or her phone won't take it now and she hasn't written me that she is in school and that everything is okay :)
And I worry about her because she is not at home, but in another, not yet fully familiar country.
I hope I have found the right math.
You didn't think I was a child
And work is of course interesting too.
However, I'm not very physically fit because I don't have such a good physical shape.

You can communicate with many people, you may know someone.
Good day, the job is very interesting, but we don't speak Czech.
Who can we give things to?
The charitable organization Archiieparchial Caritas Olomouc wants to organize a project that will be interesting for Ukrainians living in the Czech Republic, specifically in the city of Olomouc.
Imagine Russian soldiers plundering women, their children forced to watch.
Then they can relax, rejuvenate the body and all this is seen by the children.
Good day, I'm talking to you in my thoughts - I need to learn Czech language, but I can't tear myself away from the news.
I often share my thoughts with you. It seems to me that you hear my thoughts.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the President's Office, writes "European Truth".
"All the equipment, all that they are already sending, for some types of equipment it is done too late.
When we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
I see 100% support from some country leaders, it's true.
"And some European leaders have changed their position, but you can see the price of these changes," Zelensky said.
In response to the question of whether Ukraine has enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "Not yet, not yet".
The President also said that if Ukraine had been a member of NATO, there would have been no war, or it would have had a different look.
"If it had been different, we would have had close neighbors, and we could have fought together.
But he was sure that there was no war after all," he added.
We remind you that the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I have a dream that the war is over and I can go home.
Please write to me about everything that will be needed
I wanted to ask you if you know where the blender came from in our kitchen.
Destructive actions in the form of spreading fake news and disinformation aimed at provoking panic moods and destabilization, which are sensitive to public security.
I'm from Ukraine, currently in Plze≈à.
Before the war in Ukraine, I worked for 20 years as a designer of women's and children's clothing from various materials, I can also sew on special equipment and do embroidery.
I really want to work in my field, I'm happy to share my knowledge and gain new experience in this industry.
Of course it's normal that you want to see each other. I was just joking.
Sure, you can do it this way.
Today I read that they should log into the system themselves.

I hear a lot - a war on 10% of Ukraine's territories.
Why do people run away?
Why don't people live in territories where there is no war?
Are you in your glory?
Did you live in a warring state?
When prices rose by 100-200%.
When most businesses are NOT WORKING.
When there is no way to earn.
When do children hear PVO?
Did you live like that?
You can't even imagine.
And God forbid that we don't have.
If you find out, it will be a horror.
That's why we are running.
Some of us are lost, with phones... that stayed from our other life... so, some of us haven't adapted in a month.
Could you adapt in a month?
So, the state gives us 5000 crowns.
Could you live on this money?
Many funds provide food.
Have you ever tried to ride the metro with children in strollers?
When you are looking for food in one place, clothes in another, and there is no time to go to the third one.
And tomorrow we will have to go again... because the food they gave us is only enough for today.
You want to take care of yourself... but what about the children?
How to live without knowing a language?
When you can't even ask for help.
So - there are free courses... but what to choose?
Job search, food, clothing, or courses?
I have more questions than answers in a month.
But my children can't be there.
Just - understand us.
You come to the town hall and tell the receptionist that you are looking for Mrs. Krezkovska if they do not indicate the way and the number of the door to her.
It will be written on his doors, he is the head of the department.
If you can't agree, call Dominic, but I believe everything will go smoothly.
If Mrs. Krezkovska hasn't arrived yet, wait for her a minute, she said she had an appointment before that, so she might be a bit late, but she knows about you, she booked you at 9 o'clock precisely so that you could make it to the doctor.
So, of course, it would be great to spend time together

Today a new girl from Ukraine appeared in the garden.
I didn't even touch the door and it's ringing.
If I understood the director correctly, he said that if I work in the garden, I can come to work on certain days for as many hours as I can manage.
If that's the case, then I can, for example, work several hours a few days a week.
How many hours and on which days will I be watching to see how it will work out for me to go to fashion and cleaning apartments, they pay more for cleaning so I don't want to give up that job.

Give us a vacuum cleaner tomorrow so we can clean up.
Then it depends on the weight and size...
Thank you, we have already learned something similar.
All is well, we went for a walk, I'm very tired.
So if no one can come, then it won't be a problem?
I sent the documents to the email address
Only in what state did we spend this time together.....
There are many obstacles in front of myself and I can't hold on....

Thank you, something needs to be done, but I can't go anywhere now.. I need to cook and learn words.. and maybe tomorrow at half past nine.. we were registered for courses at 11 o'clock.
Marina but if you really need help with the city then my husband and I will help.
My friend and I baked yesterday, try it if you want.
Everyone was sick and they had symptoms, but we didn't go to the hospital.
A woman from Damelido just called me and said that they had sent me information about further actions to my email, but I still haven't responded.
She spoke Czech and I understood her so well.
But I don't have an email from Damelido.
I need small pliers to pull up the gap on the plate.

You will agree on the date with Mrs. independently.
Of course, but I'm throwing you off balance.
Men also have a lot of nuances.
He was a very wealthy man, but I liked him because I had my own point of view on life. I met him and then left him.
He was a very wealthy man, After a while he called and said that he had a heart operation.
Asking me to just talk to him and support him, I felt sorry for him.
He was a very wealthy man and thought he could buy me his toy and I could need his money.
Then he made me a proposal.
"There was a car in my yard, it looked like a crocodile, and it was raining.
And they kept me in the house, then they took me to the basement, and there were many people there, about 400 men, there was nothing to breathe.
As for the housing you posted a photo of
I haven't gotten there yet.
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already debunked this fake.
I will watch the last two videos when the internet is working normally.
Is there a dress code at work or can you wear whatever you have?
Alright, he will come there and take them.
I'm not greedy for everything.
I understand that I can't sit with you, I need to work.
I understand. Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 or Ukrainian television in general.
I see all the news on the Internet.
1+1 is a presidential, propagandist channel, not interesting at all for me.
What happened at the stop with the man that the police and ambulance arrived for? Is he okay?
Diana didn't answer me and you.
Okay, I just need to print out some coloring pages for the kids. That will be great. When can I come?
However, you may need a more detailed knowledge of Czech language.
I hope you are satisfied with my work.
In this case, I know a girl who is Ukrainian, but is studying in the Czech Republic in the field of tourism.
You really don't want to come for a minute with the kids peacefully and with grandma.
I want you to be with me. To wake up next to you.
Generally, it is hard to live in a foreign country, and with each passing day, one wants to go home more and more.
Mrs. Agatha, if you need this photo, then I will take a picture.
Thank you for trying to make our life here as good as possible.
I will remember you for life.
I will remember and smile ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

"I tell her that the "repair of the TV and radio receiver" was delayed due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances were warned not to talk too much when they call."
We have been hiding the information about the war from our grandmother for a whole month.
So far, it's working.
However, in Plamky (cat - UP) the fur on the belly and back legs is falling out - this can be from stress, changes in food and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but unfortunately the stress does not depend on me.
Unlike a mother-in-law, a daughter-in-law is not deaf, she hears both sighs and explosions.
Thanks to the fact that Olga hears poorly and spends most of her time in her room, her niece lived in her apartment "incognito" for a month.
On April 1st, 1993, Oksana Polova took a weapon in her hands for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days I lived with her in an apartment like a partisan."
They hid from her both the war and what I was doing - I formally came as usual for a few hours.
But when her friend ran out of words, I gave her the receiver - she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours.
The radio receiver was always by the bed.
Most of the time, the grandmother spends in her room.
Hearing badly allowed me to be unnoticed by her.
If I heard the sound of her "footsteps", I would hide in my room.
She hid the receiver and the television in advance.
Then she called everyone she talks to. That's 6-7 people.
She asked to talk to her about anything but war.
I asked my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end.
April 17th is my apartment cleaning day :)
Good evening, I hadn't really thought about it :)
Hi, if tomorrow our help is needed we can come.
Do I have to order lunch or can I bring it from home? Do I need to print these documents or will they print them on site and I will sign?
I offer men's, women's and children's haircuts with a visit to you, all interested please write in personal messages, price:
I understand you and won't complain, but in my situation I will be looking here for now.
I'm telling you, the embassy is only here.
The British soldier who defended Mariupol in the trenches of the ATO says they are ready to surrender to the Russians.
A British soldier, who is a member of the Ukrainian Navy Brigade taking part in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they will lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: the Twitter page of Aidan Eyslien, a British national who served in the Ukrainian Armed Forces since 2018, the Royal Air Force with a reference to Eyslien's family members and friends, Atlas News with a reference to the words of Eyslien's friend who spoke with him.
Eyslin's tweet verbatim: "We have received news from him: "It has been 48 days, we have tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian troops.
We had no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will soon be over.
Details: Aylin served in the 36th Separate Brigade of the Ukrainian Naval Infantry, which is taking part in the Mariupol defense operation.
BBC journalists contacted the mother of soldier En Wood, and she confirmed that her son had informed her by phone that they were planning to surrender.
Brenan Phillips, a military friend, also confirmed to journalists that in their last phone call, Ayslinn had mentioned their unit's plans for capitulation.
According to him, the squad had run out of ammunition and food.
Journalists from Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that the Eyslin division intends to surrender to the Russian divisions in order not to fall into the hands of the so-called "cadres" without weapons and ammunition.
Also, an audio recording of a phone conversation was circulated on social networks, on which supposedly Eyslin talks to his American acquaintance, who plans to travel to Ukraine.
In conversation, Eislyn said that they had tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they had failed.
Earlier, a Briton reported that he was threatened by representatives of the private military company "Wagner" on Instagram.
Eyslin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to take part in the fight against terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018 he officially joined the ranks of the ZSU and took an oath.
Eyslina's friends and family called her Johnny, but in social media he is better known by his nickname Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you. But I would also like to know. Are we together or not.
But it will be difficult, you will have to find it...
You offered to go with you, I agreed, if everything will be alright
Thank you, no need, you have already done so much for us, we are very grateful to you.
If you ever don't want to write to me, I will wait
Hello Natalya, please water the flowers outside, near the entrance doors. Thank you.
I would also like to learn Czech language.
I wish you would take a break and think about yourself a little.
Today you must definitely moisturize your face with a cream.
Ah.. I'm very thankful to you. I didn't even expect to meet such a person, good health to you and success!!!
Is Little Dushan no longer embarrassed?
Ondrej arrived with his father.
No one else went in, although there were many carolers on the street.
We are at home today.
The children have been learning their lessons, now they are playing.
After lunch I have to go to Lidl to buy groceries.
I have you.
You know that I love you.
I'll do anything for you.
How can I prove this love?
I want a chance for us to be together.
To prove it all to you.
Maybe you had a lot of disappointments.
Let me make you happy
Grandma can't, her legs and back are hurting a lot.
How much does it cost to rent a two-bedroom apartment in Prague?
Will all the parents come?
The climate is almost the same.
My family is good, my mother is still alive, I have three brothers and a husband.
One brother was at war in Mariupol, another in Zaporizhia, and the man was transferred from Kyiv to Kharkiv today.
They call every day saying everything is fine, but who knows, they won't tell the truth anyway.
I wanted to come to you, but I wanted to take care of some matters first. When
I will ask the man in the morning if he will be able to make it tomorrow.
When you come home, please write to me, I need to talk to Daniel.
The Bolshevik attackers made up for their losses in battle in full.
They shot the teacher Dmytro Pavlytskyi, his unknown relative, the young man Boris Oleksienko.
Their bodies were thrown into a "deep pit filled with earth".
There were memories of "a dead silence in the city".
Occasionally someone from the villagers ran from house to house with a torch.
On the streets, the bodies of those shot by the Bolsheviks were encountered at all times.
And maybe I will really go with you. You need me. I can't be without you.
3. What activities of your own have helped you or your friends better adapt to life in the Czech Republic?
But you won't come because there is a railway reconstruction and the entrance is closed.
Come to the bridge where the reconstruction is, tell me you have arrived and I will come to you.
The best future awaits us.
Should we give Lena the items that didn't fit us or can we give them to Kate?
So, I stopped wandering around at night.
I usually wake up very early without an alarm clock.
I sleep for 4-5 hours, but I'm already sleeping.
Marina couldn't wake me up today when they arrived)) But it takes time, it has to pass.
If I understood correctly, we will receive a letter from school to order the menu.
Let's try to take us to social services on Tuesday.
Then, when the filling is cooled and the dough is ready, we roll out the pies and fry them in a small fire in oil.
Alright, I'll definitely ask him.
As soon as we are settled tomorrow evening, I will call him on Tuesday.
I want to be able to thank everyone who helped us, because it was our last hope, really.
I'm not afraid of work, as I also lived in a village, so I can and like to work physically.
When can I bring things?
That's a very interesting tradition you have, we do that for Christmas.
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted draft law 7176, entitled "On Monitoring Potential Threats to Ukraine's National Security in the Economic Sphere".
It is amazing that the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere turned out to be... the place where members of the supervisory boards of state companies and state banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the draft law believe that the adoption of decisions by the supervisory board of the state company in the hypothetical Kyiv may somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We know about a great number of new risks for public companies, but so far there is no known company that has a need to physically hold board meetings at the address of its location.
The potential threat from such a law is clear - it is a great basis for "destroying" all the gains from the hard reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual control.
As it was before 2015.
Why do state companies have supervisory boards and who should be part of them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill is passed under patriotic slogans, tomorrow other bills may be passed - for example, the system of state procurements through ProZorro or the independence of the National Bank of Ukraine may be abolished.
A lot can be attributed to war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the start of the war and the draft law 7176.
So on February 22 this norm was introduced into the comparative table of draft law 5397.
The desire to disperse the supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some elected people for a long time.
Not because of criticism as such, but to show the possible consequences of the bill, let's consider the arguments that were used to explain the need for its adoption.
Then we will provide our proposals on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the necessity of such a notification due to the risks of losing internet and other communication tools, which will prevent remote work of supervisory boards.
In other words, the risk lies in the fact that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, which may paralyze the company's work.
Agreeing that such a risk exists, can it be prevented by the relocation of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Let's imagine a rather cynical situation when independent board members (who make up the majority of the whole composition) put their personal safety above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they can be dismissed.
Furthermore, this will likely lead to a loss of quorum, which is necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
On the contrary, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need to hold a competitive selection, which usually takes 3-4 months.
Therefore, the proposed solution of the draft law 7176 will most likely not save from the loss of the supervisory board's ability to make decisions, but rather will lead to it!
Member of Parliament, author of the bill Dmitry Natalyuk provides other arguments in support of it.
Furthermore, he states: "many businesses, particularly the defense-industrial complex (DIC), now require relocation" and therefore "it is hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vinnitsa via Zoom".
To begin with, there are almost no state-owned enterprises in Ukraine with supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is a kind of "Ukroboronprom" which essentially manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the APC.
However, even in "Ukroboronprom", according to the legislation, the supervisory board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform their duties on a non-paid basis.
The full power in "Ukroboronprom" belongs to the general director, who will also make decisions about the need to relocate any particular OPK enterprise belonging to the corporation.
In addition, such an argument does not withstand criticism because the bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises.
Mr. Dmytro on his Facebook page also provides arguments that can be attributed to the "emotional" category.
Such arguments usually have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and banks, but let's try to analyze some of them: "Respectable foreign experts, at the first mention of the word "war", will leave Ukraine in 2021, but at the same time remain members of the supervisory boards of state-owned enterprises in Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself will really suffer from the war".
First of all, this is manipulation - most of these members of the supervisory board have never lived in Ukraine and only come here periodically.
To say that they "leave Ukraine", to put it mildly, is unfair.
Furthermore, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long been resorting to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool is widely used in global practice, in absolutely different spheres: business, education, medicine, etc.
It is also important to remember that membership on the oversight board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other occupations, and precisely electronic communication tools help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
It's interesting why Mr. Dmytro doesn't express the same claims to the members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
And they too are not located at the location of their companies.
Incidentally, this is far from the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from the supervisory boards, and war is just a new convenient opportunity.
Hello. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary accommodation in a family. I have 2 children with me.
Five rockets hit my native Lviv.
My soul is filled with quiet joy. I look at Josie and see her happiness, the confidence of her steps.
Could Victor please help us with the refrigerator tomorrow? Because we won't be able to move it ourselves.
This week I could have come on Wednesday and next week I guess I could have come on Thursday.
Alright, I understand what needs to be done.
I would also be grateful if you could give me some guidance at the beginning so that I do everything as you needüòä
We usually require the passport of one of the adults.
In the Brovarsky, Vyshgorodsky and Buchansky districts of Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, a strengthened curfew will be introduced for two days.
Pavlyuk's direct words: "In the populated places of the Brovarsky, Vyshgorodsky and Buchansky districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been strengthened!"
Restrictions will be in effect on the territory of these towns and villages from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the regional administration, at this time it is strictly forbidden to stay on the streets of settlements and other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go out on the street during the alarm signal to take shelter.
Such restrictions are imposed in order to eliminate the consequences of Russian aggression - to cleanse and exchange territories.
Omelyan called on people who had left these areas to stay away from returning home for now.
On the rest of the Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.
I haven't received anything from school yet, only a payment receipt.
Do you lack important information? If so, what type and kind?
We have prepared varenyky for you to try. They should be boiled for 7 minutes.

I'll tell you frankly, I always left the person first, but then they asked me for forgiveness, they tried to restore the relationship.
But I didn't need that anymore if I was disappointed in a person forever.

I came early again on Monday and the alarm went off.
I need an apartment, we are moving, we found an apartment but there is no furniture, refrigerator, washing machine....

I am thankful to God that he does not see this war.

The Serbian defense budget has been growing in a geometric progression for several years.
In total, over the last six years Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the renewal of military equipment and the purchase of modern systems, rising to 22nd place in the list of the world's most powerful military states.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the Western countries took seriously the possibility of escalation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic resolution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.
If you're not against it, I would come.
So we registered, but it's hard to live in a hostel and it's not very convenient for my son. I would like to go to the village.
We look forward to seeing you again next time.

Security forces of the Lukashenko regime have arrested three Belarusians aged 27 and 28, who are responsible for the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signaling system near Osipovichi, which provides the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radio Svaboda", the human rights center "Viasna", the head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state news agency "BelTA".
The Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that on the night of March 30, with the support of special forces of the "SOBR", three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one of them was injured.
According to "Viasna", the men resisted actively and tried to escape when detained.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detained received injuries and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical assistance on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevich, stated that "acts of terrorism on the railway of the Republic of Belarus will be strictly suppressed" by the security forces using weapons.
On April 6th it became known that on March 30th the police had arrested another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovichi branch of the BChD and an administrator of the BChD themed resources in "VKontakte" and "Odnoklassniki" - Valentin Samasuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March in Belarus, at least 40 railway workers were detained for diverting.
We remind you: BYpol, announced by the Lukashenko regime as extreme, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out diversions on railway transport and infrastructure objects in Belarus as part of the "Victory" plan.
Belarusian "guerrilla fighters" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As is known, through Belarus, the Russian Federation is transferring personnel and equipment to Ukraine in order to fight.

Even a separate law was adopted regarding this issue.
We drove here for 4 days, it was just a horror not a road.
They were traveling through Kyiv region, the city of Irpin, there was horror, shooting, sirens.
I'm excited for them.

Temporarily, while we are looking for a university, then of course permanent residence will be needed.
But maybe there will be a hostel in it (we are looking for Prague, Brno, and other places).
We are now a few days away from Prague, we have a car, we are willing to pay partially for accommodation.
It doesn't matter if it's a city or a village, it's preferable to be a separate accommodation.
I accidentally clicked something in the waterphone and connected two unnecessary stocks for which money was taken and I can't disconnect them üò≠
And it still withdrew money from the card, which was not there
And I don't understand why the money was taken.
The cost of the repair will be paid by the owner, Mr. Dedina. He is to appear on Tuesday.
Be at home on Tuesday and wait for the repairmen.
Could I ask you for one cigarette?
Can we change the mobile tariff if you have time? Is it already too late?
The US is banning investments in Russia and imposing sanctions against Putin's daughters.
The United States, together with G7 and the EU, are introducing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, the largest Russian banks Alpha Bank and Sberbank, and also banning all new investments in Russia.
This is mentioned in the announcement on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the US financial system and prohibit US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will impose a full ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
For this purpose, US President Joe Biden will sign a new executive order that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
This step is based on the resolution adopted by more than 600 transnational companies to exit Russia.
The private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as law and consulting firms," according to a White House statement.
The third step of the new sanctions from the US became restrictions against large Russian state enterprises of the critical sphere.
This will prohibit US citizens from conducting operations with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in US jurisdiction.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the following day on Thursday.
Finally, the package includes a full asset freeze of Putin's adult children, his wife and daughter, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including the President and Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions disconnect them from the US financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.
You can only get to this place, the rest of the journey is closed and I will come to you.
Can we already wash the dishes in the dishwasher?
My name is Olga, before the war I worked as a flight attendant for SkyAp company, my mother is a seamstress of industrial products, my little son Makarchik went to kindergarten.
We lived beautifully and didn't even think that we would have to flee, because there is no strength to hide in the cellar.
I was lucky and I found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
We hope that someone will take us in at first. We can even pay for a room or an apartment, but if it's within our means.
We guarantee cleanliness and order.
We don't have any bad habits.
We will be grateful for such help in such a difficult time for us.
After lunch I had one English lecture and after that I went to work in a children's room.
I explained to Margarita how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she understood everything and will do it well.
And I also met Mrs. Lena and talked to her about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought the announcement from the pool.
This is free swimming.
You can call the school, Kira is not answering the phone, she is not responding, I don't know if she made it to school.
They are isolating the Russian office: halting investments and suspending supplies.
We didn't understand each other.
The military did not settle in our house.
Our house is located near the military base and oil base.
He just helped me because I couldn't do it myself.
I cook deliciously, don't ask for extra and give good advice.
I give myself advice.
It's a bit hard for me, but I understand that I have to go through this stage.
We will meet on Thursday and I will tell you everything.
All in all, everything is good.
How often do you clean
I clean every week.
Unfortunately, I don't have a program, but I'll try to figure it out.
I dreamed of being a teacher
My girls can't move anywhere yet, so I haven't written to the house owner.
I wanted to ask you that if you hear any information about housing, please let me know.
I would gladly share a place to live with a decent girl.
If you can know such, let me know.
I won't let you down.
Thank you in advance.
Please write down the exact address and how much the courses cost for another person Natalia, 54 years old.
I think it's better for you to make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I haven't changed my last name, it's been the same since I was born :)
Good day Mr. Reyarade! Sorry I haven't seen it. I'll do it right away and send it to you.
We are going to the medical commission now.
So, Annie needs to work on another day this year.
On which day is it better for her to come earlier? (Maybe on which day there is a bit more work?)
Tomorrow I will listen, the Internet is working badly. Early in the morning.
What are you going to do now?
Thank you.. we found some things with the items, but there was nothing with the technology...
Both beginners, apart from the alphabet, know nothing.
Nothing is happening.
Can it be on Monday 25.04.?
You can take the kids with you, there are plenty of toys here :)
I guessed about dad
Probably I'm very naive or very in love, but I'll figure something out with this money.
We'll figure it out somehow.
But how will it be paid, please, no credits.
Write to me directly, and I will help.
We are your partner, or we are not your partner.
I don't know her anymore.
Do I need to take the equipment they gave me?
Today is not my day. The blinds broke in the living room. One this morning. Now in the evening another.
Something from you came, I don't see what it is.
I'm also very sad
I will remind you about the invoice later
Does your father only speak and understand Russian?
On what day does the colleague want to do the house cleaning and how many windows does the house have?
I'm sorry to be taking you away from your business.
Good evening, I can't help but share with you. There is news from Mariupol about the son - alive and well.
I recommend reading Joe Dispenza, he scientifically investigates the influence of external factors and the formation of new neuron connections.
The journalist of the TV channel "1+1" Natalia Nagorna presented on the morning of April 12 a video recording, which was sent to her by the military of the 36th Marine Infantry Brigade from Mariupol.
The military says they have no weapons left to fight and a mountain of wounded.
They said that "the bill is going for hours".
Before this, on April 11, a separate marine infantry brigade participating in the defense of Mariupol published an address to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command had not been in contact with the fighters for two weeks.
Skepticism was expressed on social networks that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, assured that communication with the defense forces in Mariupol is established, and the details of the defense operation should not be a subject of public discussion.
Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
In the evening of April 11, Russian occupiers dropped poisonous substances of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of "Azov" Andriy Biletskyi, the Russian army used chemical weapons against the Azovstal plant, which is held by the fighters of the "Azov" regiment.
Thank you, I will accommodate myself to you. That would be very nice.
The situation and ourselves, for now we remain here
2 hours of riding )), a walk, mom to the stores and back)!
It's not an important matter.
She forgot what to do here
A squadron of Czech drones has started flying over Ukraine today.
Almost 50 professional dronesüöÅ will serve for detection, and some of them - for direct destruction of the enemy strongholdüí•.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" to Ukraine were sent yesterday thanks to the deputy of Mukachevo City Council Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today their mountain friends, led by the head of the village council and coordinator Vasyl Shchur, delivered drones for the purpose: they were received by special units of the Ukrainian army in various cities where fighting is currently taking place.
In order to maximize the effective and safe use of drones, the location of their deployment is currently kept secret.
Four friends who are helping the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop, they say: in the coming days they will send many interesting "gifts" to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
Don't worry, everything is fine. I love sweets, but I can do without them.
I'm glad we won't make it. Lots of luggage.
I'm returning to Ukraine soon to work.
Okay. If everything is alright, I agree.
I'll try to do it myself, but if any problems arise I'll write to you, if possible?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally in the house of the elder in the village in Iviv, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no housing.
She may be delighted and her mood will lift.
My phone was repaired today.
And I think I'm going to be cold on the street today too.
I took medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critically.
I'm sorry too, but let's meet when I'm feeling better.
When you have time, send me some music that you like.
I'm curious what musical accomplishments you have üòä
Mom and Dad should be listened to.
You will find him near the stroller of your little brother.
Today it was colder here and it was raining. Tomorrow it should already be warm.
But it's not the ruined houses that are a pity, it's the people who are oppressed by the occupiers.
In Kharkiv, the occupiers desecrated the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" on Perekopska Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore down the flag of the European Union, ripped off the panels with photographs of the Heavenly Hundred and the fallen in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers destroyed the portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the fallen participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The flag was lowered.
Good morning, thank the children for the carol, we don't have such a tradition so we didn't know, we only gave the children chocolate and cookies, maybe something else was needed to give.
There is someone to talk to in Czech if needed.
Because I live in a dormitory, there will be twelve people here and then they will go to work.
Hello already a little better.
I already went to the fair today.
Even today it has already slept there.
We already have great progress.
I will definitely bring varenyky for everyone else too!
Today I don't have the strength to do them.
Since I'm pushing away from the days and times when I have to do the cleaning of the apartments after guests, I can roughly say it's in April month because I already have a rough cleaning schedule for the apartments.
I can roughly say at the end of April or at the beginning of May for the month of May.
I just asked if you have anything to say about it.
Hi, sorry I haven't replied for a while, I was preparing dinner and had a little nap.
If you don't mind, could I come today?)
Or let's meet after your arrival)
He is modest here, lately he has been studying a lot. He realized that this is very necessary for him in life.
Hi) everything went very well.
I was a bit shocked to be working with people at such a high position.
Today I had a lesson with the director of the regional economics department, Ms. Vyshchyna.
She was very pleased with my work.
Grishko behaved well in the orphanage.
On Monday I have to bring proof of employment and also cash payment for the lessons.
I'm running away from Friday
I'm not doing anything, just eating a lot and sleeping üòÇ (and drinking a lot of water ‚òùüèª)
If I'm going to the doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you if possible.
I have to bring one more analysis.
But we won't have to go again.
The drain pipe is working very badly, it's not draining well. We need a master. It needs to be adjusted.
That's all that's missing
Can you send me the correct email address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you signed up for.
Do children celebrate there and do you need to bring something with you?
And now, one question can be asked to you in a moment.
If you need help, write
If I'm not mistaken, are you celebrating Easter today?
We didn't really want you to collect money so people wouldn't think we were speculating on this!
However, for online filling I was not enough two points:
I'm going to rest. Recharge my strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Good night.
üòÑüòçWhat a great idea. I'll watch the video now. It will be good because the whole family will be painting.
Karazin University calls on employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and rumors.
Rely only on official information.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who stayed in Ukraine, also helps the army.
I gathered a few works for my portfolio.
After the holidays they have to do an internship.
I would like to be your backup designer.
How will I be credited for the day I was absent from work is a question.
Summing up the staff: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state".
Literally: "It is not excluded that the Russian Federation Armed Forces will carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighboring state".
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive grouping of troops for operations in the Slobozhansky direction.
Probably, in the nearest days, the occupiers will try to restore the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send personnel, weapons and equipment for participation in combat operations on the territory of Ukraine.
Preparation of armament and military equipment is being carried out at the permanent deployment point of the 60th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Monastery) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that the specified armaments will be relocated to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, to replenish the personnel losses of the battalions of the tactical group of the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzya, Transbaikal Territory) of the 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District, a recruitment of servicemen from the specified brigade is being carried out.
A particular problem is felt by the enemy when staffing drivers and mechanics-drivers.
The departure of the selected personnel from the permanent deployment point is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Probably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of cargo to the places of combat operations, will continue to strike at transport infrastructure objects on the territory of Ukraine with the aim of their destruction or withdrawal from service.
The designated units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to fulfill the task of strengthening the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
On the Slobozhansky direction, separate units from the 6th General Army and the Northern Fleet coastal troops continue partial blockade of the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of individual districts of the city continues.
On the Izium direction, an aerial reconnaissance of the area is underway in order to detect the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this, the enemy uses the UAV "Orlan-10".
With two battalions of tactical groups, the enemy tried to launch an attack in the direction of the populated places of Dovghenke and Dmytrivka, but he had no success and retreated to the previously occupied positions.
On the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to concentrate its efforts on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhne, Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to launch a storming operation in the Golden area, but was unsuccessful.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue their assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the sea port.
Separate enemy units carried out artillery shelling of Ukrainian troops' positions in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopillya, Trudolyubivka and Maryanske.
In the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Ukrainian defenders repulsed four enemy attacks in the past day, destroyed five tanks, eight units of armored vehicles, six units of motor vehicles and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
Didn't understand your thoughts?
We will try to make it on time, but I'm doubtful.
And how can you sleep, I'll keep you
Are you definitely not against me coming?
If you don't feel like seeing each other today, just tell me, I'll understand)
Thank you. We don't watch TV at home, let alone 1+1. We don't need to set it up :)
I'm turning on the TV here exclusively to listen to the Czech language.
My tariff package for the month is ending today :)
Can we do this today over the phone?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, threads for embroidery
I understand that I can prepare material in this field.
I will ask her. I'm a bit embarrassed to ask, she already gives us so many pies.
We will then meet with my father, definitely üôèüèª
I read an ad on Facebook, so Google probably wrote something on its own. I think the phone number is enough.
Good day, we took the things you brought, but are there small things that we can bring to you for 10 minutes?
I thought about the job.
If the director agrees, I can start working from next week because tomorrow I plan to go to the employment office to submit documents (if possible, because there are very long queues) and on Saturday it will rain :)
I'm looking for a team to start with, I really liked chemistry in school, I'm studying Czech language to perfect my knowledge, I dream of working in Prague.
Friends old and not so old, friends I don't know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have also come to you.
Over the last month, I have been in contact with many of you.
Your life, which was never easy to begin with, has been turned upside down, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing from Russia.
And many of you have admitted that you feel guilt and shame for the actions of your country towards your neighbors.
Through those to whom Ukraine is subjected in your name.
A threat has been looming over some of you, activists, for a long time, and you were preparing for a decisive strike.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Oleksandr Cherkasov, my very old friend from "Memorial".
Sasha replied concisely, as usual, "Let's talk about it in a bit. Now let's go through the ruins after the search."
Others, such as cultural figures, artists, critics, and writers, are amazed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of villains and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: except for a few of you - those who worked at "Memorial", "Novaya Gazeta", "Echo of Moscow", "Meduza", Navalny's organization and a few other places - how many of you did anything to oppose this regime?
Apart from taking part in the rallies when they were still taking place.
Also read the column of Russian journalist "Late to Hide, Late to Be Silent"
And if so, are you sure that your feeling of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Maybe they were provoked by your long indifference to what was happening around you, your apathy and your passive participation, which now, undoubtedly, have a great burden on your soul and heart?
It wasn't always like this.
In the 1990s there was a short period when you had a certain degree of freedom and democracy - chaotic and even bloody, but real.
1991 was not better than 1917.
Why every time, when you finally have a revolution, are you ultimately overwhelmed by such a strong fear of chaos that you seek salvation behind the back of the king, be it his name Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he killed, you still feel safer around him. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and exposing the archives of the KGB, as the Germans from the staff did, you devoted a soul to the monument to Dzerzhinsky - and allowed the KGB to sink to the bottom, renew, reform and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with the choice between plundering the country and returning the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option - and you meekly accepted the plunder.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, marking the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
Survival became the main concern.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and boost the economy.
Few of you bought into it, but you all either voted for it or gave preference to not voting at all.
When he started to compare Chechnya with the land again, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember those years well.
I was then working in Chechnya, helping the victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and with my own eyes I saw the ruins of Grozny, Katar-Yurt, Itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I returned to Moscow and had fun with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: about the tortures of innocent civilians, about the murdered children, about the soldiers who sold the bodies of the fallen to their families.
You told me: "Enough of your Chechnya already". I remember those words very well.
In response, I replied: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, not mine.
I'm just a bad foreigner here.
This is your government bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens.
No, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic boom of the mid-2000s, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look the other way as part of the stolen money stayed in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have become well-off, some have become wealthy, and even the poorest of you have bought a new home and found a better job.
Prices rose, so what's the problem?
Moscow sparkled and glittered with splendor.
When several oppositionists ‚Äì Yuriy Shekochykhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Oleksandr Litvinenko and others ‚Äì were killed, many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.
However, the matter did not go further.
When after two terms Putin handed over the post of president to Medvedev and himself took the place of Prime Minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When after several months of Medvedev's rule Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or kept silent.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in the cafes and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we probably didn't do much at the West if we did anything at all.
A little bit of outrage, a few sanctions; but what does it matter that Russia is loudly violating international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, this was the most important.
Nevertheless, at the end of 2011, my Russian friends, you finally woke up.
When Putin again swapped places with Medvedev and planted himself in the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that this was already too much and you all went out to protest.
The name of Navalny became famous, you didn't go out on the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he struck back in response.
Initially, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were left behind the bars.
Someone got great terms.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I'm still hearing it.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak".
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Enraged by the Russian president who had dashed their European hopes, they seized Maidan once and never left it.
They built a makeshift town completely independently and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to break it down, they began to defend themselves with clubs, armor and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
Instead of running away, the protesters went on the attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained their democracy, the right to choose their leaders and remove them if they do their job badly.
Maidan did not please Putin at all.
This was a bad example.
Taking advantage of the general confusion, he seized Crimea.
Someone of you was against it, but there was little benefit from it.
How many of you were taken captive!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Suddenly, a new myth was born, and many of you who had been disparaging Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
It's hard for me to find a reason, since immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends mostly kept silent.
"We are not interested in politics," they said.
And you were hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, as if they were new after the restoration, which the mayor of Moscow began in 2012 - with their benches, public Wi-Fi and hipster cafes.
Indeed, Donbass is far away, but Moscow is so beautiful - and it only gets better.
You have recently paid attention to Syria.
Were there terrorists there, right?
IDIL or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview then because I knew nothing about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw for myself how the state snipers of Homs were cold-bloodedly shooting at my teenage children on the streets.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers were there, who in 2015 began to bomb thousands of innocent civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Undoubtedly, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niem√∂ller:
First they came for the socialists, but I remained silent - because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the union members, but I remained silent - because I am not a union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent - because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say anything in my defense.
How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Who among you did this?
But the majority remained silent.
Someone really speaks now - like, for example, Dmytro Hlukhovskyi, Mykhailo Shyshkin, Mykhailo Zigar, Maxim Osypov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak out from abroad, some - from within the country, like Marina Ovsiannikova, risking to end up in a new GULAG or to join Navalny's company.
As for others, you know best in which country you live.
I'm sure you understand: when Putin deals with Ukrainians - or, which seems very likely, if he fails - he will turn to you.
To all of you, my friends: to those who bravely, but mostly alone, went out to protest and have so far endured a short term, but soon will face a more serious one.
For the thousands of you who signed the petition, who expressed their disagreement on social networks (even if it was just a black square on Instagram) or expressed themselves in private conversations with colleagues at work.
Hours, when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given simply for a joke, have not gone into a distant past - and now they, with great probability, await you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will remain?
The example of Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - appeals to the Putin regime: they demonstrate that it can be fought.
And what reason, motivation and courage can stop him, however oppressive his advantage may be on paper.
Taking everything into account, few people in Russia are aware of this, as well as the fact that the war is still going on.
But you, my friends, know well what is happening now.
You read foreign news online, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine, with whom you maintain contact.
And Putin knows that you know.
Be prepared for it.
You understand where it's all going.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your choices are just a joke, your laws, if not taking into account repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper they are written on, your last free media are no more, your economy is crumbling faster than I can write, you have no more credit cards to buy a ticket for a flight abroad, even if some flights are still left.
Now Putin won't be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.
If you don't give him what he wants, you can either try to negotiate or be prepared to be disappointed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet one remains.
Ultimately, this regime will collapse.
Maybe in the current circumstances, you will need less from you than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not come from you: due to the economic collapse that is engulfing Russia, it is most likely to ignite in the provinces, in small towns.
If prices go down and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years, wanting bread and peace, will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is you, my friends.
But if each city will come out to the rallies on its own, as it has already been done periodically, it will not be difficult for it to suppress them one by one.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be transformed into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool - the Internet, which the regime can restrict, but which still works and which can be adjusted almost under any circumstances.
The organization of Navalny was crushed, but others can be created, more informal and more decentralized.
There are so many of you, millions of you.
The Moscow police can handle up to 30,000 people on the streets of the city, possibly even up to 100,000.
If more than 300 thousand come, she will be amazed.
It will be necessary to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to the matter?
After all, what did he force them to do in Ukraine, what did he force them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel a familiar fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I would be scared too if I were in your place.
Taking Syria and now Ukraine as examples, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to defy their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but actually try to get it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will make a joke in a computer game chat - and will be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the internet - and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and will die in a Syrian cell under police batons.
This has been happening for many years now - and it will only intensify, gaining ever larger and larger scales.
So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.
Act coolly, think strategically and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday and we were told that we could come back on Monday.
We will be home in the evening.
Do you take me as a press secretary?
How often do you go out to a fancy restaurant for dinner?
Once in a while I go to an expensive restaurant for dinner.
I'll try to explain it to her)
We liked it very much and we wanted something closer, so this is the best option.
I was in a room where there were a lot of people. I was exhausted energetically.
I feel bad, coughing, fever, lost voice, weakness, and dizziness.
I must go to that job.
We have already done it, but said that those who registered in April will only receive money at the end of the month.
We need an appointment for four, we are going to the doctor with the children.
But last night I received a letter from a lady who liked your work and wanted something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for news from her and I will definitely let you know.
Working in the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, spending a lot of time and effort.
I had a difficult psychological, responsible, intellectual job in which I was completely disappointed.
It's a shame to lose time, but it's a life experience.
