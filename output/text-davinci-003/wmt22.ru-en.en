From my point of view, the literature program was formed by Balzac's age ladies based on their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century we preferred Dostoevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote belles-lettres, of course, from the point of view of those very Balzacian ladies.
Psychology and the sufferings of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, it's very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were plush to depict a certain variety of them?
There are roses of such a color and with such a petal structure, reminiscent of velvet, usually dark red or burgundy tones.
And the light roses look different, the petals have just an atlas or silky shine.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195 Mattress.
The "Micro-Package Prestige" model: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different firmness sides: the medium-firm surface is formed by latex-coated coconut fiber and natural latex, the moderately soft side is a natural latex plate.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeping person, preventing the appearance of the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the merits of the model, breathable materials should be highlighted.
Latex, perforated for air permeability, is well ventilated naturally, just like coconut coir.
This maintains a healthy microclimate of the sleeping area.
An extended warranty period also applies to the mattress.
The official manufacturer's warranty period is 5 years, but in practice the mattress lifespan is longer.
Protection from dust and dirt is provided by a removable jacquard cover included in the set.
Buy an orthopedic pillow to go with the mattress - it is recommended to maintain an optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as an anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

Andrei, it has been clearly explained to you that pensioners work in schools, they will not work in a team line.
The computer teacher won't be able to help either, he wasn't taught this, the school kids are playing games on Windows.
So there is no support.
I shudder to remember those feasts and guests in my parents' house.
Guests at the doorstep, and cutlets are still frying on the stove, mother is bustling around mopping the floor.
Lord, he was already too weak to sit at the table.
Then mop the dishes and clean the house.
A week before the holiday you haul groceries, two days of cooking, and a day of cleaning afterwards.
And the guests?
They are good, and they must also bring a cake with them.
Since then, I don't like holidays, guests.
Even for my family, I set the table with the bare minimum.
And I cook them delicious treats, I bake very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth vaccination against coronavirus is inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed strength.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be sufficient for full protection.
The head of the Association of General Practice Physicians, Ulrich Weigelt, is convinced of this.
This was reported by Die Welt on Saturday, December 11th.
"We expect that a fourth vaccination will be required by summer at the latest, fall at the latest," says the expert.
In addition, Wiegel hopes that the fourth vaccination against the coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with the flu vaccination".
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new coronavirus strain "Omikron".
Moreover, the new version is particularly dangerous.
So, the probability of re-infection with "Omikron" is three times higher than with Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide an Omikron-adapted vaccine by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omikron".
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the efficacy is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times".
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omikron strain," BioNTech and Pfizer emphasized.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts are pushing for faster vaccination rates in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernhard Zalzberger, advocates for reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Furthermore, according to Zaltzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"Israel's experience is very convincing in this regard," the expert emphasized.
Wobbler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21Â®.
She (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created with the use of bottom fishing in mind, not just casting.
These lures have a higher specific weight than their close analogues in size, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the top slider made of strong and elastic plastic, creating additional shades of vibration when vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vib" when fishing with Bet-A-Vib, it demonstrates a fairly aggressive game.
Often the most effective animation is a simple monotonous animation, that is, the movement of the rod up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a confined space cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles, for which a snag is possible.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant when catching perch and large perch in winter, especially in the middle of winter, when a precise and aggressive bait delivery is required.
Reaching the end point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also successfully used for winter fishing for pond trout.
To satisfy her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It has also been noted that Bet-A-Vib can tease a passive pike, which does not even react to bait.
When casting, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates distance and accuracy.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, it goes well with both monofilament and braided lines of even large diameters.
For catching pike, pike perch, perch or perch, in addition to uniform current and "step", sometimes with "chirping" on the bottom.
If you are fishing in snaggy areas, you can switch to a double hook which will reduce the chances of snagging.
Among its class of lures, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most reliable in operation and, consequently, one of the most productive.
It can be used with equal success both on relatively small and on quite deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young idlers are sitting on the necks of the old parents.

Libya has reported 7,000 Russian mercenaries
In Libya there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) "Wagner".
This was announced on Sunday, December 12, by the Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Khaled al-Mishri.
Currently, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the Wagner Group in Libya.
They have airplanes too.
They also dig trenches in Sirt and Kufra.
They have 30 jet aircraft at the Gardabia airbase (also used as a civilian airport in Sirt), - Anadolu agency reports his words.
Haftar al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries are "trying to seize" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after they "bring their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain presence
According to the interlocutor of the publication, Moscow was looking for a country to preserve its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya".
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufra, noted in the agency's publication.
Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner Group is receiving support from the Kremlin.
Where else could mercenaries be?
According to the agency, "Wagner" is reportedly active in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection for leaders, and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use mineral and natural resources, as well as to supply weapons, technologies and military services to these countries," the article says.
According to the media, the "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and CAR.
This group is not registered with either the security services or the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not listed in the personnel records.
This company is under US sanctions.
We remind you that earlier the ambassadors of the 27 EU countries approved the restrictions against "Wagner".
It is expected that the European Union Council will approve this decision on December 13th.
Situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya de facto is the second chamber of the parliament with consultative functions dominated by Islamists, TASS reports.
This body has repeatedly called for the transfer of the single voting day for parliamentary and state head elections from December 24th to at least February 2022.
"Less than two weeks remain until the elections, and the chances that they will take place on time are rapidly decreasing," is noted in the material.
Against this background, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates indefinitely, according to Sky News Arabia.
Russian Foreign Policy Through the Eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures prevail.
Examples of successes - "Protected and restored peace in Syria", "Resolution of the "Nord Stream-2"", "Frightened the whole world with powerful weapons", "We took away Crimea".
The main failures are "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world", - says the research of the Public Opinion Foundation.
The Dubai government has completely abandoned paper-based bureaucracy - all government services have become digital only.
The Dubai government announced a complete rejection of paper-based processes and a transition to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This was reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marks the start of a new stage of digitalization of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," said on Saturday the Crown Prince of the Emirate, Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
Now, the internal and external document circulation in all Dubai government entities will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The new initiative affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing and communal services, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, as the authorities calculated, 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which amounts to 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary equivalent.
Previously, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin stated that electronic services would save citizens two days a year.
Well, asking about birth dates and how old the child is, that's already ridiculous, asking about the class and group in kindergarten too.
I don't believe that such shenanigans happen.
And if they do exist, they obviously don't care about anything, including family.
My mom, her two brothers, and her grandparents lived on 3 Vladimirskaya, it was a ground floor without bars.
They knocked on the door first, then on the window, then decided not to stand on ceremony, broke the window and got in, but Grandpa had a baseball bat, which they got.
These people knew for sure that someone was at home...
Production and export of cars in Turkey have fallen below the 2020 level.
Production and export of cars in Turkey sharply decreased in November due to the devaluation of the lira.
As a result, industry figures for the 11 months were worse than last year's results, Bloomberg reported, citing data from the Turkish Automotive Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, in November in Turkey 115 thousand cars were released from the factories, which is 20% less than the year before.
Approximately 75.9 thousand machines were exported, which is more than 25% lower than the previous year's figure.
And if the automotive sector of Turkey showed a positive dynamics compared to the previous year for the first 10 months of this year, then the production of cars for the 11 months of 2021 was already 0.3% worse than the previous year's indicator.
The cause of this decline was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 MSB entities have received a deferment on credit payments in 2021.
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation regarding the provision of benefits for small and medium businesses, according to the correspondent of MIA "Kazinform".
According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, in the current year in fulfillment of the order of the Head of State from April 1, 2021, the order of the Chairman of the Agency from April 9, 2021 No. 127 "On Approval of the Procedure for Granting Deferral of Payments on Loans to Small and Medium Businesses" was adopted - Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy request.
He reminded that the order of granting payment deferral for loans provided for granting banks and organizations carrying out microfinance activities, payment deferral for loans issued to MSB subjects, including individual entrepreneurs, before April 1, 2021, from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the discretion of the MSB.
The borrower's statement could have indicated a different payment deferral period.
During the deferment period, the creditor's pre-litigation work, notification of the need to repay overdue debt, as well as the collection of commissions and other payments by the creditor were suspended, the Deputy Prime Minister noted.
For 2021, applications for payment deferral on loans were submitted to second-level banks by 603 borrowers-subjects of SMEs, of which 553 SME subjects received deferral for a total amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
"At the MFO, applications for deferment were submitted by 131 MSB subjects, of which deferment was granted to 95 subjects for a total of 105.8 million tenge," concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily carry the "okmiron" strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to tolerate it better than those with a strong immune response.
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the "Okmiron" coronavirus strain may be dangerous.
The cause should be sought in the conditions of the virus's emergence.
Scientists believe that "okmiron" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficient person.
That is, upon mutation he encountered no resistance from the immune system.
As a result, he is more aggressive.
Due to the lack of an immune response, he became very fast.
Apparently, there are more of these spike proteins, spikes, maybe than usual, their antibodies were not reduced during mutations - comments pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to tolerate "okmirone" better than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that a strong response of the organism to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the organism can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when young people in their 30s die, while elderly people in their 60s just get away with a sneeze.
The immune response of the young man is completely inadequate: where he could only threaten with his finger, he beats like a cannon at sparrows - concluded Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that there are dangerous side effects of coronavirus and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Lung inflammation can be bacterial and viral.
If the first case is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to suppress only the symptoms - all hope is in the organism.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication of the body - this is temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then come the respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough.
Whether the pain is on the right or left side, abdominal pain can also be a sign of an underlying problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, by the end of the year, they may start vaccinating the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old.
The head of the genome engineering laboratory at MIPT, virologist Pavel Volchkov, noted that this category of people is very actively suffering from COVID.
Teenagers who go to school have the maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socially active stratum, like the children of kindergartens, said "Moscow 24" Pavel Volchkov, a virologist, head of the Genomic Engineering Laboratory of the MIPT.
Huge thanks to the author for this article.
I refreshed the memories with pleasure...
Teach-In.
In the distant seventies and eighties, no dance floor was without the melodies of this group.
And at home, gathering with friends, they would have dances to their music.
Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of Covid.
The authors of the work studied the fat tissue remaining from bariatric operations and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can be infected with coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, were also infected, showing a strong inflammatory reaction in the process.
Scientists also studied the fat tissue of patients who died from COVID-19 and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and the flu can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid an immune response.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of this.
The biologist explained the causes of dementia.
Doctor of Biological Sciences Semen Goloshekin named the causes of dementia and told about ways of its prevention in an interview with the radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself as a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty orienting themselves even in a familiar environment.
Golosheikin noted that most often dementia is caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
"At the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity may play a role," he said.
Unhealthy habits such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, sleep disturbances, and a sedentary lifestyle also contribute to the development of dementia.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence," added the biologist.
To prevent the occurrence of WHO diseases, it is recommended to maintain the necessary level of physical activity, train cognitive skills and abilities requiring the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, the professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the Federal State Autonomous Educational Institution of Higher Education "Russian National Research Medical University named after N.I. Pirogov"
N.I. Pirogova, the head of the department of cognitive impairments of the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnologies, Anna Bogolepova, spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned around 30,000 illegally exported artifacts from the country.
In the last 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to repatriate around 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country through contraband.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, on the Al-Hayat TV channel by the head inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
"Only this year in the Bible Museum in Washington, 5300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered," he said.
Abdel Gauad clarified that all artifacts smuggled out have been registered in the archives.
The department staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists "track auctions around the world and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector reported that upon their return, cultural values are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
On July 4th, Christie's auction house held an auction in which a bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (approximately 680 million rubles).
This provoked dissatisfaction from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artwork was illegally exported in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amun, has been kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic ended up in Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively striving for the repatriation of illegally exported monuments of antiquity from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42 thousand people - that's how many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
The only thing that unites them is the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants to gain access to employees' personal mobile devices.
Credit Suisse is requiring its employees to provide the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The thing is that in Europe and the US, the Swiss bank does not provide its employees with corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can review information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to solve business matters with colleagues or customers.
The bank reserves the right to inspect mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote working, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the hardest for the poet's earthly existence and his "ego".
He is already outside of any literary associations, he parted ways with impressionism, he is independent, but well-known, in demand, sometimes harshly criticized by critics, even spitefully, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their hands.
Over the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them true masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, and the collection "Soviet Russia".
The main success was that on the 25th of June, Gosizdat concluded an agreement with Esenin for the publication of his works in three volumes.
No modern poet has been honored like Sergei Aleksandrovich, he was the first!
Moreover, it promised very good money - according to the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, the director of the plant received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
Funds were needed that year more than ever.
Esenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter Sofia Tolstaya, it was necessary to arrange a family life, maintain sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seemed that life was settling down, there was something to be happy about, but for him everything was predominantly painted in dark tones, as if a nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death) had materialized.
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is it the wind whistling
Above the empty and deserted field,
What, like a grove in September?
Alcohol is scrambling the brains.
Many acquaintances noted that Esenin had deteriorated greatly, looked bad, and was obviously ill.
Nervous breakdowns and breakdowns are becoming more and more frequent.
And the cause is probably not only alcoholism...
In any case, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was made to Sergei Aleksandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents left.
Let's say, related to May 1923, when Esenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Aysedora Dunkan, was recovering his health in a clinic near Paris under Professor Peter Gannushkin (Esenin will come to him again two years later, already in Moscow).
As for the poet's songs, there is enough evidence of scandals on this soil, and dozens of memoirs have been scattered to the police.
Since the beginning of the 20s, the poet's terrifying novel with the green snake has been rapidly developing.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin briefly stayed with his friend, the imagist Ivan Starcev.
Surprisingly, despite his quite decent income, Esenin never had his own housing either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he stayed in rented apartments, hotels or with acquaintances.
Starcev remembers:
He only came to stay overnight and in most cases in an incoherent, drunken state.
Once, returning at four in the morning, Esenin fell on the staircase landing...
Falling, he scratched his face and wheezed.
Coming to his senses, he started coughing continuously, spraying the sheet with blood...
Even Esenin himself, after his travels around Europe and the United States (there was a dry law in the States at the time, but Dungan brought a decent supply of alcohol with her), admitted:
I didn't see anything there except for taverns and streets...
I'm almost done and I stopped remembering people...
Well, and drank, of course...
And I drank because loneliness gnawed at me.

It is possible to manufacture this mattress model in a rolled version (vacuum roll-pack).
Now my son is almost 16 and he no longer has any desire to experiment with drugs.
All the energy is directed towards choosing what he will earn a living from.
He is much more responsible than I was at his age or my husband, who had periodic problems with the law up until the wedding.
The father takes care of his young daughter.
And loves, as Lermontov wrote, "strangely love".
Why did the girl cry on the exam when she hadn't even failed it yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that this wasn't school?
Well, she will have a tail.
So what?
He will retake it.
Millions of students know this.
What is this all about?
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon" against the EU.
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon".
The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland, Pavel Yablonsky, expressed the opinion that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The corresponding statement by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was made in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus have temporarily "stopped Lukashenko," but he is "actively looking for new paths."
The Polish official is also confident that now illegal migrants will be used as a weapon "in many points of the world".
As kp.ru reported, the European Union has implemented the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 physical persons and 11 organizations.
Europe has declared its readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve".
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not by Seryozha's hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man a laughingstock
Velvet jackets dominated the 2021 social events.
Daniel Craig was probably the first to announce his new fashionable solution.
At the premiere of the movie "No Time to Die" in September, he appeared in a velvet raspberry blazer and a traditional "Bond" bow tie.
Following his example, Prince William twice followed, first wearing a green velvet jacket for the Earthshot Prize award ceremony that did not conform to the royal dress code, and then choosing a more classic option for the event in support of the Royal Variety charity fund.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend caught on with Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to pick up his seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
Incidentally, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress is already noting the growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to the analytics of the service, received by "Gazeta.Ru", their products have been purchased 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with lining and a close silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next, and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are represented in almost all brands this season - both Brioni and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desired model is Gucci, in which one of the premieres of the movie "Gucci House" ambassador of the brand Jared Leto appeared.
When choosing expensive brand jackets, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special weaving technology, a dense fabric with a velvety external texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
Cheaper options are made from cotton or polyamide, but they also serve less accordingly.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that when it comes to velvet jackets, the most important thing is not its model or style, but appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a formal event," explains Vakhoshkin. "It will also be suitable for those cases when the invitation specifies the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion, the observance of which allows to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first and foremost, should have the right advanced company with enough money - the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Handsome Brammel" believe. - Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to scheduled social events, where a dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with equally elegant items: classic trousers with arrows, monochrome shirts, silk ties, loafers with brushes, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Brammel's Beau" are sure: it will be inappropriate for an ordinary employee to appear in a velvet jacket at a corporate event, but if we are talking about "a leader from those who organize this event, then - "yes", such a thing is appropriate for him.
If an employee is of a lower rank and their goal is to advance higher in a complex corporate hierarchy or to earn financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate the phrase "not according to Senka's hat", - the editors of the Telegram channel on men's fashion believe.
Very ambiguous feelings from the voice.
It's an unnatural tone, so rehearsed.
And it has nothing to do with the sweet face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of the people around me.
But from the bottom of my heart, I wish you luck in life!
It's all about the money - alternative energy is well-lobbied, that is, paid for.
Billion dollar investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has increased.
Traditional energy sources are also not in demand - both gas, oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are sold now.
There is a high demand for fuel.
A penny drops.
Who's flying then?
As usual - a regular customer.
Does the sheriff care about the problems of the Indians?
Therefore, it is not right to consider Western politicians as idiots, "sleeping through" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a decent wage.
I didn't see a single attractive person in the photos in the article.
Just mediocrity within the framework of average statistical passengers.
It is likely that if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole carriage, then they will not be approached, most likely.
But only because of mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauties", but certainly not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who is aware of his slave status and fights against it, is a revolutionary.
A slave who does not recognize his slavery and languishes in a silent, unconscious and speechless slave life is simply a slave.
A slave whose saliva flows when he voluntarily describes the beauties of slave life and extols a kind and good master is a flatterer and a hypocrite.
The immunologist stated that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the "Omikron" strain of the coronavirus.
Vaccination four to five months later can protect against the new strain of coronavirus infection "Omikron".
Immunologist Nikolay Kryuchkov made such a statement, calling the vaccination after six months, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, "a very long period".
"Under the previous strains, this period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure after five months, and for people with chronic diseases - after four," said the expert, calling in parallel with the vaccination campaign to take up revaccination.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has had two vaccinations and a booster, or they have been infected and vaccinated, or vaccinated and then infected, then they have acquired 'hybrid immunity', that is, enough antibodies and neutralizing ones," clarified the expert.
The G7 warned Russia of "significant consequences" in case of an invasion of Ukraine.
The countries of the "G7" (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, United States, France and Japan) have released a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It is emphasized that "Russian military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will be expensive" for Moscow, but specific measures are not described in the document.
"We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine," the statement said.
Subsequently, the ministers call on Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels, and abide by its international obligations regarding the transparency of military activities," as President Biden said during a video call with President Putin of the Russian Federation on December 7.
"We confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in the east of Ukraine," the foreign ministers of the G7 also said.
Any use of force to alter borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in response," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
"We will intensify our cooperation in our joint and comprehensive response," is also stated in the statement.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Truss, stated that Russia will face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "the unified voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia".
The Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective than the omicron-strain.
The efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omikron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower than other types of illness.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have come to this conclusion, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was deemed less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 medication.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variant," Professor Malik Peiris said.
At the same time, scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe disease course when infected with coronavirus.
Previously, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic taking into account the influence of the omikron-strain.
The authors of the study concluded that the Omikron-strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense accused Germany of blocking NATO arms deliveries to Kiev.
The Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Alexey Reznikov, accused the government of the former Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Angela Merkel, of blocking the acquisition of deadly weapons by Kiev within the framework of NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov reminded that last month Germany imposed a veto on Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and machine guns for drone strikes.
At the same time, it is noted that Berlin later softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to acquire the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the USA, the UK, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the position of the new German government under Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the issue of arms deliveries to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect arms deliveries from Berlin with Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous German government explained its refusal to provide weapons as a risk of escalating the conflict in Donbass, despite the "Russian occupation" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will maintain with the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that Kiev is expecting assistance from Berlin in equipping the navy.
Ukraine is counting on Germany to be a "technical partner" to Ukraine, the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he spoke in favor of selling defensive weapons to Kiev.

G7 warned Russia of responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine.
The foreign ministers of the G7 countries warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, according to the final statement of the parties.
The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the reinforcement of Russian armed forces near the country's borders.
"Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs," says a statement published on the UK government website.
The ministers of the G7 countries and the EU's High Representative noted that they are "united in their condemnation of Russia's armed buildup and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine".
The head of the UK Foreign Office, Elizabeth Truss, warned of "serious consequences" for Russia at a press conference in Liverpool in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We made it clear that any invasion will have significant consequences...
"G7 wants Russia to renounce aggression towards Ukraine," she said (TASS quote).
At the summit in Liverpool, G7 foreign ministers agreed that in order to resolve the crisis caused by the buildup of Russian forces on the Ukrainian border, the parties must return to the negotiating table.
The conversation was about negotiations in the "Norman format".

The Russian Foreign Ministry representative Maria Zakharova stated that, by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries "have demonstrated their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes".

Ways to recover stolen money from online stores have been revealed.
There are several ways to get back money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in a conversation with RBC.
So, to reduce the risk of large losses when a bank card falls into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be put aside in a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend setting up a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen during purchases in stores that do not use 3D Secure protective technology, a refund procedure can be initiated.
"In accordance with the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility lies with the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service," clarified a representative of Promsvyazbank.
The expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, Arthur Zaremba, emphasized that the buyer has the right to submit a statement to the bank to dispute a fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used a card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be contested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return the money to the customer if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19th, a member of the Public Chamber, Director of the Safe Internet League, Ekaterina Mizulina, reported that only in 2021, 11 thousand appeals were received on various cases of fraud: from the sale of counterfeit documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints about online fraudsters.
Schulz arrived in Poland to discuss the "Nord Stream 2" and EU legislation.
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian forces on the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream-2".
Although Scholtz declared his intention to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has stated that he will be calling on Schulz to speak out against the "Nord Stream 2" pipeline, which is intended to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravetsky, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin declared that it will help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.
However, the Polish judicial system remains one of the causes of disagreements.
The European Court has fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party "Law and Justice" violate EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation has priority over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite demands from Poland and the United States, did not take on any public obligations to stop the "Nord Stream 2" project in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany to stop the gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a high-ranking US congressional staffer said Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violates the Ukrainian border, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by representatives of the G7.
Dmitry, look more carefully.

And I know such apartments very well and I can see perfectly how it was redesigned.
May all be well with them.
It always amazes me when people write about the means to clean a sink, toilet, windowsills, and faucets.
You wash them once a year for Easter or something, so you have to scrub them right away.
Just don't let it get polluted.
The Ministry of Culture wants to give writers residencies.
The state will transfer federal property left as an inheritance from the Union of Soviet Writers and the Literary Fund of the USSR to the Future Support Fund for Russian Literators.

The plumber who found money in the wall of the church will be paid $20,000.
The plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the American state of Texas will be paid a reward.
This is reported in the press release of the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred at a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that devout Christians will be rewarded with wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cooley was repairing one of the church toilets and discovered thousands of packets of money and checks under the insulation.
He donated the find to the church and, according to his words, he didn't even receive gratitude from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say: "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
"We understand what you did and what you could have done," - KPRC-TV quotes him.
It appears that the discovery is related to the theft that occurred at the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then, around 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in the form of checks stored in the church safe disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of 25 thousand dollars was offered for information about the criminals.
Justin Cooley could not claim this amount since the reward's validity period had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which had previously allocated a reward of five thousand dollars and later received another twenty thousand dollars as a gift from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive 20 thousand dollars.
It was previously reported that police questioned Pastor Joel Austin regarding the money found in the wall of the Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic "as a real person".

This was reported by the RTHK radio station, citing a notification from Hong Kong's health authorities, TASS reported.
A 68-year-old resident of the Huai'an urban district in the southern province of Guangdong has been infected with an infection after keeping poultry at home.

Since then, the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
In Brazil, citizens are required to present vaccination passports upon entry into the country.
In Brazil, it is mandatory to require a COVID passport from those entering the country's territory, a decision made by Judge Luis Roberto Barroso of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF).
CNN Brasil reports this.
Citizens with contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a vaccination certificate.
Also included in the list of exceptions are those who have arrived from countries where the absence of the vaccine has been proven.
"The situation is even more serious if we take into account that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow," Barroso noted.
Previously, the authorities of Brazil have mandated that unvaccinated tourists from coronavirus infection must observe a five-day quarantine.
The full protection scheme from COVID-19 has been revealed.
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altshtein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of full protection from coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injecting and administering a nasal vaccine.
When administered intranasally, a large number of immunoglobulins A are formed. When the vaccine is administered by injection, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the organism.
Inside after vaccination, we mostly form immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you get both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision yet about double vaccination," the medic said.
The Chief Epidemiologist of the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using intranasal vaccination in combination with injection is the possibility of ceasing to be a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help those in which case the body's defense should presumably become maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod Region, David Melik-Guseynov, stated that the new surge of the COVID-19 pandemic will be caused by the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, this is the picture seen in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I used to talk to my dog (who has long since passed away) like this - if you're ready to exchange a warm home, food, affection, love and games for a wet bitch, then go ahead.
But the sparrow was trained and generally smart.
He chose his company and went home.
The video shows a method that works in 90% of cases.
It's not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I have held back many owners so they wouldn't run after the dog, even though they heard that 200 thousand of them (pomskies) were running away, I would take them by the hand and lead them in the other direction.
In the end, "200 thousand" chose the owner, not the dog that was running somewhere there.
Mass protests against vaccination opponents continue in Europe.
More than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets in the Austrian capital Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against Covid mandatory.
From February of next year, undocumented people will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros.
Spaniards, outraged by the government's policy on healthcare, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held signs in their hands with the words "This is a false pandemic", "I will not be vaccinated".
A large protest rally against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In an autonomous community, a COVID-certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and night entertainment venues.
The authorities of several regions of the country have decided to introduce sanitary passports in response to the increasing number of coronavirus infections.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters demonstrated against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The demonstration started peacefully but then escalated into clashes with the police.
The group of demonstrators began to throw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this matter.
Kashcheva-Rudneva is also referred to as "the first Russian doctor of medicine", probably because she began her studies earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve the title.
I only agree with Zakharova that Americans brought only death and plunder to any country they appeared in.

The WHO has already detected the "micron" in over sixty countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that the new strain of coronavirus "Omikron" has already been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The WHO reported on the spread of the strain.
According to the organization, by December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it only began to spread actively from the end of November.
WHO also expresses concern about the high rates of spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may surpass the degree of spread of the "delta" strain, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in all countries without exception.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has previously stated that the Omikron strain is capable of having a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the United Kingdom.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "Omikron" will displace "Delta" in the coming months.
The number of those infected in Britain alone is estimated to be around 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially "omikronom" at the moment in the Kingdom are ill several hundred people, and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "Omikron" strain, and at the peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals daily.
The British healthcare system will not be able to cope.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to the latest research, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "Omikron" strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
How the Russian "Sputnik V" reacts to the "Omikron" is still unknown - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the "Omikron" strain.
Why do we need to see stages of aging?
It would be better to SEE the execution of your exercises in more detail.
It's unclear in the first exercise how to do it: sitting on your heels or standing on your knees as written, but then how do you support yourself with your hands on your thighs?
Hands on the waist?
Curious Little Squirrel, you are right, communication on the Internet is quite different, it is easy and relaxed to communicate, but when meeting in person there is nothing to say.

Again, Soviet times are called "the time of the Besov".
Back then people believed in God much more honestly than today.
And we were raised practically according to God's laws (love for the neighbor, do not steal, etc.).

Our St. Petersburg (more precisely, Leningrad) communal apartment on Bolshaya Zelenina still supports communication to this day.
Of course, we are not the closest of friends, but we try to maintain a warm relationship with the older generation.
Maybe it's related to the fact that there were no visitors in the apartment, the rooms were not rented out, and the blockade brotherhood was not canceled.
Unfortunately, we are seeing each other more and more at funerals.
Lara Angel's, come on!
Human infants, especially males, are strong, active, energetic, squirming, pushing, fighting, and wrestling just like their little "cousins" in the wild!
It's a pity that they are not as soft as puppies or kittens, so bruises, bumps, scratches are common, but no bumper cars!
And for what?
Did you underestimate the strength when you pushed your brother?
Are you always so agile that you never accidentally hurt anyone and never injured yourself?

Behind it are the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).

Russians were warned about a new scheme of fraudsters
Criminals have started to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
This is reported by "Izvestia" citing experts.
According to Zaura Abutalimov, the Director of Products at Ivideon, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication is deepfakes.
In this case, fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this neural network, it is possible to accurately reproduce the characteristics of the behavior of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using deepfakes, criminals can call the victim's acquaintances via video link or create a video featuring a copy of the person for distribution with the aim of blackmail.
"Such counterfeits can easily provoke bullying, since a malicious hacker can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios," said the expert.
Varonis System Engineer Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He emphasized that this can create specific risks in the case of technologies using video.
David, I'll add it.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I bought all this in a small town where the local mentality did not allow to dress up too much and wear short skirts, show stockings and tights on the legs.
This is a province, but there WAS such a product in the store.
In big cities, Muslim women wore makeup and showed off their hijabs.

Five actions are listed that will help avoid diabetes.
Problems with blood sugar levels are one of the most common in the world.
However, some don't give this much importance, and it's a mistake.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the variety of drinks and switching to regular water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods can raise the blood sugar level to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step on the path to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keep them at home.
Not only improper nutrition but also habits can influence the onset of a disease.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, it is necessary to move a lot.
Experts advise sticking to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet not only helps to reduce weight, but also protects from sharp fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, it is necessary to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fiber fills the stomach and thus contributes to the feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and the increased absorption of food.

Doctor Pavlova talked about "weekend migraines" in workaholics.
Several factors can lead to a deterioration in well-being on weekends.
The cause of the deterioration of well-being after working days is often "weekend fatigue", said the famous endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior research associate of the faculty of fundamental medicine of Moscow State University, scientific supervisor of the Clinic of Systemic Medicine Zukhra Pavlova in her Telegram channel.
According to her, hard workers are especially prone to this, with headaches, fatigue and weakness observed on weekends.
Doctor Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue over the week, there are enough objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to the change in conditions.
On weekends our life changes fundamentally.
"We sleep long, lie on the couch all day, probably eat more and drink less," argued the doctor. "Due to lack of coffee, a small breakdown begins."
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and fragmentation.
Late rising plays an additional role.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction called jetlag.
It arises in travelers who cross multiple time zones.
To determine which factor plays the decisive role in deteriorating well-being, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes the most on weekends.

Scientists in South Africa have declared the low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against "Omikron".
South Africa has reported low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against "Omikron".
Scientists from the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the Omikron-strain of coronavirus infection.
According to the estimates, it (the level of neutralization of "omicron") corresponds to the level of vaccine efficacy of 22.5% against infection with symptoms, which... casts doubt on the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection - the study text published on the MedRxiv portal states.
At the same time, specialists clarified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Previously, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the Omikron strain of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in familiar products?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
His excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that a hidden sugar may be listed under an unfamiliar word in the product composition - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calories, composition and glycemic index.
The label may contain several dozen names, essentially denoting sugar.
Some of the most common and often encountered names are glucose and fructose.
Other hidden sugars may also be present, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (blackstrap), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to monosaccharides and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery products, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to the label and the many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but whatever the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
Chancellor of Germany Scholz: Gas will lose importance for the FRG in 25 years.
The new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has stated that the import of gas is losing importance for Germany as the country continues to transition to a decarbonized economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to the FRG and Europe will play a different role," said the Chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as it currently has an important role in the energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the US had made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was recorded.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbok stated that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the minister, it was stated in the course of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement that European law in the field of energy should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline does not currently "comply with the requirements" of the European Union.
Thanks for the interesting photos!
In 1985, I had to travel to those parts.

Hackers hacked the Twitter account of the Indian Prime Minister
Hackers hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The criminals had managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal means of payment, and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
At Mode's office, they were asked to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the Prime Minister announced that they quickly responded on Twitter - access to the account was restored.
The Indian Prime Minister's page was already hacked in 2020 and called for donations to a fund using cryptocurrency.
In the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence.
The third referendum in New Caledonia, held on December 12, ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12th at noon, the majority of the inhabitants of New Caledonia voted in the referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted "for" independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "against".
The turnout was 43.90%, and more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia participated in the elections.
As France-Presse agency commented on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt", as supporters of independence called on voters not to participate in the voting.
As initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic on the archipelago prevents a full and "fair" pre-election campaign.
Thus, this abstention opened the way to the third victory of the supporters of the French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
Separatists have declared that they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to speak on the results of this referendum.
The topic of New Caledonia's independence has greatly invigorated the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates have spoken in favor of keeping the territory as part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific Ocean".
"New Caledonia must remain French," Eric Zemmour repeated multiple times.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valery Pecresse, who at the end of October published a column in Le Figaro, calling on the Catalans to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility".
Nevertheless, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia".
Prime Minister Jean Castex expressed "a strong desire for the choice of the Catalans to be the choice of France".
Hi, Sveta!
I have wronged you a lot... a lot, still embarrassed, ashamed.
Thank you for not turning away from my channel.

But as an artist - not an artist at all: what can be changed here?
Just don't forget that the food was NATURAL, so obesity was not as widespread as it is now.

The device is capable of neutralizing explosive objects from a distance using a laser.
The maximum flight height of the new model reaches 3 thousand meters.
After passing the relevant tests, the UAV must be put into service for the Turkish military, who will use it to destroy explosive devices without the involvement of sappers.
The agency emphasizes that Turkey is among the six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drones.

Readers of the WSJ criticized the article about the relations between Russia and the US.
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized Professor Christopher Hartwell's article in which he described his vision of the relationship between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West allegedly sacrifices Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger emanating from Moscow and made a number of insulting statements against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of Hartwell, he called on Western countries to "stand as one front against Russia".
Readers of the WSJ expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There is a lot of false information in this article," - RIA News quotes a comment from one of its readers.
Europe is not ours to lose, and Ukraine is not our land.
"The USA and NATO allies will never enter into a nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine," noted another.

Ukraine will start producing new generation of unmanned reactive drones.
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant, they will start producing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was announced on December 11 by the external advisor to the head of the Ukrainian President's Office, Alexei Arestovich.
That is, they are capable of acting against aerial targets, against other drones.
Even against piloted aviation.
They will have Ukrainian engines and other Turkish avionics: fuselage and the like," - quotes Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA drones, Arestovich said that these are reactive, not piston drones.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which surpass it "in all characteristics".
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the factory by the end of next year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the authorities of Turkey in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The night before, the Ukrainian General Staff had classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems in the course of joint military operations in Donbas.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the construction of a modern military drone factory had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine is planning to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a center in Kiev Oblast for training personnel, testing, and servicing Turkish UAVs Bayraktar.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum a "big real step forward".
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport
Lions escaped from Changi Airport in Singapore.
This was reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from the container with seven lions that had arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the runaway lions curled up on the roof of the container.
The animals couldn't move away from him because of the protective fence set up nearby.
The standoff ended after the arrival of Mandai Wildlife Group personnel at the airport, who are in charge of all Singaporean zoos.
They immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
It was previously reported that a lion had escaped from its owner and was roaming the streets of Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home and no people were harmed.
Specialists warned of the risk of cancer due to Vitamin B9.
Studies have shown that an excess of Vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express publication.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not lack folic acid are less likely to get certain types of cancer, in particular colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dose contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietitian Bet Kitchin advises to keep track of the amount of folate consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer only increases if there is a significant deviation from this figure in either direction.
Kitchin recommends not to take vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, to be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid cereals with milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fain called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Since it is contained in avocados, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.
In the UK by April, up to 75,000 people could die due to the OMICRON strain.
British scientists' forecasts show that due to the spread of the Omikron strain of the coronavirus, up to 75,000 people may die in England in the next five months if restrictive measures are not tightened in winter.
This was reported by the newspaper The Guardian, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of the specialists who are part of the scientific-consultative group on emergency situations at the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, the country will record no less than 25 thousand fatal outcomes due to the Omikron strain, and a total of about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the disease, hospitals will be receiving more than 2,000 infected people daily.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be needed to prevent overloading the National Health Service if the Omikron strain proves more infectious than the Delta variant and existing vaccines are unable to prevent infections," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM.
Previously, the UK Health Security Agency informed that if the spread of the Omicroon strain remains at its current rate, by the end of the year the country will have around 1 million cases of infection.
By the middle of December, the Omicroon strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, 1898 cases of infection with the Omikron strain of the coronavirus have been detected in the UK, of which 633 were identified in the last 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sadjid Javid, indicated that in reality this indicator could already reach 10,000 cases.

The demand for superyachts has grown in the world by a quarter
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce carbon footprint and fight climate change.
The number of yachts ordered in the world register of ships amounted to 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of fighting the consequences of climate change for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for 50 million dollars and more will not decrease, writes The Guardian.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there has not been such excitement in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If before all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are held via Zoom.
Broker Will Christy told the newspaper that shipyards are accepting orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, as long as their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super-rich can afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
Sociologists say that the wealthy do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, travel to space, life on yachts or flights on their own planes cause resentment in society, since the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to take action and propose new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, although they understand that it will be extremely difficult to do so given the mobility of money.
Meanwhile, not only the number of ordered super-yachts is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1200 vessels, 27 have a length of the keel over 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge RÃ¸kke is building a 183-meter-long yacht called REV Ocean.
After launching, it will be the biggest yacht in the world.
The yacht is equipped with a "moon pool" and a submarine designed for exploring the depths of the sea.
On existing superyachts, helipads have become commonplace, outdoor cinemas, and on some of them, such as the wrestler McGregor's yacht, there is a platform for wrestling. Professor of Economic Anthropology at an American University in Indiana, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has a symbolic meaning if we consider that there are slightly more than 2000 billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the emissions footprint of billionaires is thousands of times greater than the footprint of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the biggest polluter of the planet Roman Abramovich is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emission trail went to his 162.5 meter long yacht Eclipse.
Even if there is no owner on board the yacht, the crew continues to sail the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not evoke sympathy from other people when, like Australia's wealthiest woman Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, they complain on YouTube that there is no berth for their giant ships.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for vessels over 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been identified that leads to the development of bowel cancer.
American scientists have determined how much alcohol per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
The specialists came to the conclusion that the consumption of four or more alcoholic drinks per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
At the same time, the probability of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
Furthermore, the risk of colorectal cancer is higher in moderately drinking men than in women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of the development of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a detrimental process for the organism.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child.
Many, or rather all, dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very intelligent.
But they don't even realize how advanced four-legged pets really are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to definitively determine how animal intelligence has developed.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study shows that a dog can respond consecutively to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' works were published in Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, they understand nothing about politics, economics, and art, yet they often manage to outwit their owners.
Experts believe that representatives of some breeds show the best results in understanding human language, but there is not enough statistical data for accurate conclusions yet.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking and in terms of learning ability do not lag behind a two-year-old child.

Ukraine is preparing for trade with the US and Russia.
The United States and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for the publication "Glavred".
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations in the near future regarding the guarantees of the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "join anywhere".
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, like selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you won't negotiate but just send away the one offering it.
"In relation to Ukraine, a trade is looming," wrote the analyst.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"Preparations are conducted secretly, quickly, and they immediately move on to offensive actions, rather than waiting for the grouping to be discovered and countermeasures to be deployed," he noted.
China is stimulating the development of the railway transport industry.
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the US, Germany, France, and other countries at the 2021 China International Railway Equipment and Manufacturing Exhibition held in the city of Zhuzhou in Hunan Province /Central China/.
The core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. enable trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, noted a representative of the company, Hou Zhao Wen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation at the beginning of this month, have already been equipped with data technologies that will ensure increased reliability and operability of rolling stock.
Over the last six months, China has significantly increased its exports of railway transport vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing the "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first two-story high-speed electric trains developed in China, intended for export to Europe, rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
At a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, a trial operation of the metro train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The movement along this metro line will be opened next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"The Chinese industry for the production of railway transport equipment is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Fan Yao-shan, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the Chinese Committee for the Promotion of International Trade /CCPIT/.
"This sector constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment in the global market," said Fan Yaojian.
After more than 60 years of intense work, carrying out a number of independent research and development, China has created an advanced system for the production of railway transport equipment, with a full range of auxiliary means and large-scale production activities.
According to Fan Yao-shan, the country ranks first in terms of electrification of railways and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia.
In an interview with Radio Sputnik, Doctor of Biological Sciences Semen Goloshekin listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, the signs of future dementia may be forgetfulness, as well as a range of moderate cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, plan, and reduce the level of abstract thinking.
Currently, there is a discussion about whether hearing loss can be an early symptom of Alzheimer's disease as well as one of the risk factors for its development, said the specialist.
Golsheykin emphasized that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular atherosclerosis are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, reducing the risk of dementia will help by studying foreign languages and actively communicating.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills with games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, however their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being discussed in the scientific community," said Golosheikin.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic thinking," said Golosheikin.
Previously, a charitable organization for dementia research in the UK has stated that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40 and over.
Doctors have identified the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign can be considered vision problems, which cause the patient to have difficulty recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing weak-mindedness, specialists called aphasia - a state when a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
The neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent for treatment abroad.
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, said neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the medical consortium created by the Georgian ombudsman.
His (Saakashvili's) neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
The specialist said that the stable problems are those related to mobility, coordination, and variable character, which do not exceed the normative limits and now the ex-president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia," Toidze noted, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to boycott the receipt of medical assistance after employees of the penitentiary service subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician was able to quickly repeal the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

Protests against COVID passports took place in Spain.
Protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate have taken place in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, according to the Europa Press agency.
Approximately 3,000 people participated in the rally in the Catalan capital.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and night entertainment venues.
Many demonstrators came to the rally without masks.
On their posters, they accused the government of totalitarianism and called for respect for the citizens' choice.
In Valencia, vaccination passports are also required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city have declared a medical dictatorship and called vaccination an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Restrictions are also planned to be introduced for the unvaccinated in Russia.
The government submitted a bill on a unified QR code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, catering establishments and retail outlets with either a certificate of vaccination or a certificate of illness or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for train and plane trips.

Steep Climb: How Chinese Become Skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create resorts of international level in the country.
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will allow the 1 trillion yuan mentioned by President Xi Jinping to be collected, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The Taivu ski resort in Zhangjiajie, located not far from the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese people.
In addition to infrastructure construction in the region, greening works are also carried out: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, including in Zhangjiajie, where resorts are located, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long-term perspective is to provide a comfortable and interesting vacation at Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, there is still a long way to go.
Justin Downs, the organization advisor for the Games, says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese skiing industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year more and more Chinese people go to the slopes in winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the significant changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, according to Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation needs to be created there.
Gao Makong, 70 years old, lives in Chunli, not far from the venues of the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chuni, and now none of the local residents suffer from unemployment.
More and more stores selling clothing and winter sports equipment are opening in the country.
On the slopes, points of public catering with dishes of national cuisine are opening.
There is now even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiwan.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes should become leaders of the largest international competitions, and resorts and equipment - to reach the world level.
More than 5 billion people in the world could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the pandemic, the WHO declared.
More than 500 million people in the world could be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled progress in humanity's quest for universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) have said.
In connection with the International Day of Universal Health Coverage marked on December 12, WHO and WBG have published two complementary reports.
They stated that the pandemic has led to disruptions in the provision of medical services and has caused excessive strain on health care systems.
In this connection, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of the population by immunization has decreased, and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and WB emphasized that the pandemic has caused the "worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment".
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their own pocket".
In October, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres declared that the coronavirus pandemic had plunged more than 100 million people into poverty and that more than four billion people had virtually no social protection.

Reuters: Taiwan's minister was cut off from the broadcast of the "Summit for Democracy" at the request of the White House.
The speech of Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technologies Audrey Tang at the panel discussion during the US-organized "Summit for Democracy" was translated into a video-less mode, as evidenced by the Summit's YouTube recording.
Reuters agency, citing sources, claims that the image was taken down at the request of the White House.
According to their statement, the cause was a map in which Taiwan was highlighted in a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Mrs. Tan was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries of the world according to the degree of protection of civil rights.
Taiwan was marked on it in green as "free", and China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam - in red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the image from her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government".
China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources note that the map presented by the Taiwanese minister could be at odds with the "One China" policy that Washington adheres to.
One of the agency's sources claimed that after the map demonstration, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Summit for Democracy" took place from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society organizations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate summit, the editor-in-chief of "Novaya Gazeta" Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption could be donated to charity.
Earlier today, the Deputy Secretary of the Russian Federation's Security Council, Yuri Averianov, stated that the summit had an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".
They give you information as if they are preparing food, and everywhere there is stale meat, in fact, the butcher keeps the last piece of meat.
The classic of journalism is to create news out of nothing.
They boil not meat, but horns and hooves, obtaining a substance like glue.
The finished product looks like a yellow semi-transparent strip with almost no smell and is hard like plastic, used as a natural gelatin.
Generally, there are just as many harmful substances from recycling waste as from decomposing it.
But it saves companies huge amounts of money.
Therefore, a fairy tale about ecology was invented for fools who will also work on garbage collection for free for the idea.

On July 20th, Blue Origin successfully conducted the first suborbital flight of the New Shepard spacecraft with passengers on board.

But how many and when they have children, it's not your business until they gather those children to hang on your neck.
And since this is excluded, what right do you have to condemn them?
I guess it's only like that in education...
The chosen (self-appointed) parents dictate their own rules, openly disregarding the existing ones.
And if this applies to other areas of life, such as the judiciary and so on?
For them, the laws are not written.
But what if Dad still implements his own method of upbringing and education?

China is strengthening prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land border crossing points are located.
The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council of the People's Republic of China issued a circular requiring the strengthening of prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land ports are located in order to further prevent the importation of infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the specified cities must provide a negative result of the COVID-19 nucleic acid test obtained within 48 hours prior to departure.
Those arriving in cities with land border crossing points must submit at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day when the corresponding provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of the specified cities, up to March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities with land border crossing points that meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported a "sad conclusion" in the relations between Russia and the United States.
The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergei Ryabkov, assessed the prospects of Moscow-Washington relations in an interview with Izvestia.
He noted that the long path of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not started yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some kind of improvement in relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion based on the long journey we have taken with the current administration, Trump, and Obama.
"The problems didn't start yesterday," the diplomat pointed out.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the US's attempts to impose its approaches on Russia on a variety of issues.
The head of the Foreign Ministry added that he would not risk making optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and did not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cyber security, no progress is observed.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergei Lavrov, at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, stated that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
The virologist warned of the danger of vaccinating with an intranasal preparation against COVID outside the hospital.
Those who have been vaccinated with the intranasal COVID-19 vaccine may develop an allergy and need medical help, so the first points for administering this preparation should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virologist, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of biotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University, Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to organize vaccination points with intranasal vaccines in airports and shopping centers, but I would do this initially only in medical institutions.
The thing is that the probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine exists, it is small, but it is desirable that a person sit near the doctor's office after that.
Doctors have special sets of antiallergic drugs that work literally within a minute or two, which can sometimes be very necessary," said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience in using the drug has been accumulated.
He also emphasized that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person sneezes after injection when their nose is blocked.

Sky News informs about this.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the "Omicron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people were infected with a new variant of the infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people infected with the new strain of COVID-19 in the UK has reached 3137.
Previously, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in a pessimistic forecast calculated that in England due to the outbreak of the coronavirus caused by the "Omikron" strain, up to 75,000 people may die by April.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions.
The press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of the continuation of "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
"It is impossible to impose some restrictions against Russia and not suffer oneself," said an official representative of the Kremlin on the air of the Russia 1 TV channel.
Peskov claims that this is "understood by everyone in the world".
It was previously reported that the US is considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles to dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, Sberbank head German Gref is sure that this is impossible.

The inhabitants of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France.
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, an overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave the French Union.
This was reported by the French television channel BFM.TV on December 12.
96.5% of those who voted expressed themselves against independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the south of the Pacific Ocean supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were annulled.
The turnout for voting on that day was very low: around 55% of the archipelago's residents came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by the calls of separatists to refrain from participating in the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the residents of New Caledonia voted in a referendum against independence from France.
In 2018, a referendum on the issue of independence had already been held in the region.
The majority of the inhabitants supported the archipelago's inclusion in France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometers away from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
Approximately 270,000 people live on the archipelago, the territory has a special administrative-territorial status.
There is an agreement from 1998 between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice with a two-year difference.

The WHO preliminarily considers "omicron" to be less dangerous than "delta".
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily believes that the "omicron" is less dangerous than the delta-strain of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there is data on the decrease in vaccine effectiveness against infection with the new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9th, "Omikron" has been registered in 63 countries.
Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the "Omikron" strain allow us to assume a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary conclusions from South Africa, it is assumed that the severity of the disease may be less severe than with "Delta", according to a WHO technical report.
The organization notes that so far all registered cases of "omicron" infection in the EU are mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, according to preliminary data, the new strain is spreading faster than "delta".
Two cases of infection with the omicron-strain have been registered in Russia.
They "had previously been immunized," reported the Gamalei Center.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, stated that there is no reliable data yet that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios for Zelensky have been named.
Former Verkhovna Rada deputy Vadym Denisenko listed four scenarios for the development of events for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may remain without the support of the West, and also, possibly, will go for compromises on Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told about this in a publication on the "Glavred" portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called "the perfect storm," assumes that Ukraine will no longer be supported by key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
Such a development of events will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"At the same time, prices for key goods that we traditionally export are decreasing <...> internal protests and resistance to the authorities from key FPGs (financial-industrial groups - Ed.)," added the former parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will come true in the case of high turbulence in world politics, in which Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to this situation, the Ukrainian government may go for compromises on Donbass, as a result of which there may be opposition within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's positions will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the words of the former MP, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation between the population groups that are not in agreement with Zelensky and the president, which could lead to the seizure of control over the power bloc and the implementation of "populist initiatives".
In the course of such a crisis, Zelensky will start "reformatting of power", Denisenko added.
Another scenario is to transform Zelensky into the "father of the nation".
Some event may lead to this, which will be a strong shock to society.
"The event should be sufficiently large-scale to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," said Denisenko.
Such a development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological catastrophe or aggressive actions of Russia, according to the former deputy.
At the same time, the Russian side has already rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president had fallen to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts have predicted a situation in which, in the case of the upcoming presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% of the votes would be cast for Zelensky, while 14.5% would be cast for former president Petro Poroshenko.
Of those surveyed, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

Thank you to the author for the story about the great athlete, I didn't know that Elena Shushunova had died, it's very sad to find out such a thing.
I remember how I rooted for her at the Olympics in Seoul, for us, residents of the Primorsky Krai, it was a live broadcast, real time.
Such a surge of passions, emotions were soaring, I remember the joy when Elena won.
They also rejoiced in the other victories, such as cheering for Salnikov, for the footballers, for all the Soviet athletes at the time.
Once I saw a documentary on one of the Central American countries on TV, and there watermelons were rolled onto the ship's deck like barrels.
The watermelons were of monstrous size.
I myself have worked many times in my youth on the harvesting and loading of watermelons in the Astrakhan region and have not encountered watermelons weighing more than a pood.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the vine and no earlier than the beginning of August.
Balconette bra with soft lace cups (size: 90E, color beige, composition: 90% polyamide, 10% elastane, article: 12008).
A balconette bra with soft lace cups on frames.
The bottom part of the cup is reinforced with an inelastic transparent fabric.
The inner side of the cup, in the area of the strap attachment, is reinforced with non-elastic fabric in a fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is precisely this element that prevents the lace from stretching.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated through the festoon along the neckline and under the bust.
The vertical ribs on the side panels made of single-layer microfiber do not allow the fabric to curl up in larger sizes.
I really didn't like the article, it was nasty and venomous.

The poet arrested for the action on Red Square said: "They give 10 days for a quote from Yevtushenko, here is the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student from the Higher School of Economics was detained at Red Square with a poster with the hashtag #poetforrussiamorethanapoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
Alexander was issued a protocol under an administrative article for repeated violation of the order of conducting a public event.
He was first detained on January 23rd on Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now the interest in it, unfortunately, is lost, to the decline of general culture in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his arrest and to further explore the message of his message.
How were the police officers treating you during this and previous arrests?
What were they asking in the department about your campaign?
This time the employees were more polite, the detention was maximum, polite, as funny as it sounded in some context of this word.

Researchers have revealed how potatoes can help fight age-related disorders.
The research showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and microelements that contribute to improved blood circulation and reduced cholesterol levels.
Root vegetables contain vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All of these elements help to function the systems of the organism.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Thanks to its high content of choline, it is beneficial for the digestive tract, and with regular consumption it can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, root vegetables are best stewed or boiled, not fried in oil.
Previously, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as with other products with a high glycemic index.
These are products with carbohydrate content that quickly break down into sugars, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic drinks, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in private subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the current production deficit can only be compensated by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from Yandex's search results.
Candidates for departure
In 2015, the rights holders from the "RAEK/Media" cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites on the Russian Internet and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to, among other things, regular domain name changes, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search engine of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "The Calamari Game" and "Tenderness" by director Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest video service in Russia, ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the animated new release "Enkanto", but judging by the video quality, it is what is called a screener (a pirated copy of the movie filmed in a movie theater).
The series "Univer. 10 Years Later" of the TNT channel (part of "Gazprom-Media") is available on Filmix, which can also be found through search engines.

Dimax Micro Ultimate mattress, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimat.
The model is convenient because it has two different surfaces in terms of softness - high hardness and slightly more than average.
The product is composed of only quality and premium fillers that have proven themselves exceptionally well.
Springs: a block of independent springs "micro-package" is installed in the center of the model.
This means that 2000 coils are allocated to the sleeping area, which work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that provides a unique point-by-point adjustment.
"Micro-package" is the highest frequency of all the variety of spring blocks "Dimax", so it has a clearly expressed orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillings: combinations of layers of coir and natural latex are installed above and below the springs.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface is covered with latex, the other is covered with coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long been a classic status, since it not only conveys orthopedic, but also anatomical properties to the mattress.
If a coil provides proper back support, then latex gives an adaptation of the surface to the human body.
The cover: the model comes in a stretchy Aloe Vera jersey cover.
At the customer's request, it can be made both removable and stationary.
The overall height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the sleeping place is 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: warranty period - 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its full safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certification.
Estonian scientists will be searching for life on Venus.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, reported on Sunday "Actual Camera".
The goal of the missions starting in five years is to assess the suitability for life of Venus's clouds, and then to search for life there.
For the Tartu project, scientists proposed tools to measure the acidity and oxygen content of Venus clouds.
It has been assumed until now that the clouds of Venus, the closest planet to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally a planet of the Earth type.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus is to arrive.
Suppose we find life there, then the main question will be - is it similar to earthly or different.
If it looks very similar, it will be obvious that terrestrial life did not begin on Earth.
If it differs, then it is more likely that life originated on Earth," said the leader of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project, Mihkel Payusalu.

Metaverses will transform Russian business.
The topic of metaverses became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
Therefore, businesses in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will invest in creating their own metaverses and monetizing them afterwards.
Meta-universes should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend towards creating remote interactions in the context of the pandemic, after all, people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is a consequence of businesses striving to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models to them.
With the third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to a digital format.
Anya, you are right, changing your diet is a conscious process.

You can have a spoonful, try it and that's enough.
After all, there are ten weekends ahead, so you can prepare any delicious and healthy dishes.

The British economist was unable to make a forecast for 2022.
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to give a forecast for 2022, as, in his opinion, such attempts would fail.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the coming year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the course.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, followed by inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the price increase on goods is temporary or not.
As the specialist pointed out, even before the pandemic it was clear that "the world of central banks' infinite generosity has already lived out its time" and it is time to return to relationships where interest rates, taking into account inflation, will correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that, against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of an ultra-soft economic policy may, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as poverty reduction and climate change, summarized O'Neill.
Earlier, the head of the Global Research Department of "Open Investments" Mikhail Shulgin reported that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate for 2022 remain, although the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar course, Shulgin named the Federal Reserve's monetary and credit policy, the dynamics of oil prices, and fears against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic.
I'm forced to agree.
But one thing is pleasing: if you compare yourself to yourself, then five years ago there were fewer containers.

Russians gave auto dealers around 4.5% of the country's GDP.
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than for the same period last year, according to the statistical data of the Russian Automotive Market Research (RAMP) agency.
To understand the scale - approximately the same amount (around 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
At the meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in September last year, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenue on the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia leads.
In the 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars for a total of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than the year before.
The increase in the related Kia brand of Hyundai is even more significant - more than 35%, and the revenue from car sales is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In the leading positions, this brand and the increase in the average car price - for a year at Hyundai it has grown almost by 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - the dynamics of the price increase was only at Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, sales volumes of Korean brands have not grown so significantly: according to the statistics of the Automakers Committee of the European Business Association in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more cars over the same period than the year before.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Completing the top three leaders in terms of sales volume in monetary terms is Japanese Toyota - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand for 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
Following the Japanese is Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has seen growth in both sales volume (37%) and the average price of a car (nearly 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
"At Mercedes-Benz, there is a simultaneous good growth in sales and average price - more, for example, than BMW - which leads to a greater financial capacity," explained NAPI CEO Tatyana Arabadji. -
Chinese brands are demonstrating fantastic sales growth rates, also significantly increasing their financial capacity this year.
Russian Lada in terms of revenue growth demonstrates average market indicators (plus 28%), Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles for cars of this brand for 10 months.
At the level of last year, companies whose sales of machines in units in 2021 have fallen are financially capable: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is in the minus - for 10 months Russians spent on off-road vehicles and pickups of this brand 12 billion rubles against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with auto component supplies and production shortages that have affected the global auto industry, car companies continue to adjust prices continuously - the same "AvtoVAZ" has increased the cost of Lada models seven times in a year, the last price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Prices are regularly updated for their own products and other car manufacturers.
The volumes of the Russian car market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the car deficit, inflation and the desire of automakers to make up for past losses, experts say.
In the conditions of a car deficit, I think that many car companies were even able to partially transfer to the consumer the expenses of previous periods that they could not include in the car price earlier.
Analyst of VTB Capital for the automotive industry Vladimir Bespalov says. -
I assume that in terms of finance, automakers are feeling very good right now, sustaining a high margin of sales.
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rates of car prices observed during 2021, with new car prices rising faster than inflation, according to the expert.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
With an increase in supply, the possibilities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the cost of cars slows down, automakers will be able to make their income from volumes, notes independent automotive consultant Sergei Burgazliev.
Taking into account the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now striving to get the maximum profit from each sold car, notes Burgazliev.
No minimum increase in the production of machines is expected in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is further fueled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the backdrop of the current market situation, cars have become a good investment object - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its original cost, an expert notes.
Biden expressed about the redeployment of US military to Ukraine in case of Russian invasion.
The US leadership has never considered sending American military to Ukraine in case of a Russian "invasion".
President of the United States Joe Biden made such a statement.
"There have never been such plans," said the head of the White House in response to a journalist's question about whether the US had abandoned the idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he emphasized that the US and NATO have no obligation to use military force to defend Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American forces unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukrainian territory, the US will redeploy forces to the NATO Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Estonia).
"We will have to deploy more American and NATO forces to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia" - said Biden.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, emphasized that Moscow has no intentions to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he indicated that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use of drones supplied by Turkey by Kiev, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory".
I immediately leave such interviews.
If they already want to make me listen to screams at the interview, wait for hours, drink some strange slop and wash another cup - it's scary to imagine what will be at work.
I will find a normal place without an intermediary where I can talk directly to the manager.
Promtex-Orient Monolit Combi 16 Mattress 100x185 cm

Universalism and orthopedic support.
The mattress is suitable for people of different body types and ages.

The mattress is perfect for both one person and a family couple.
Those who appreciate it the most will appreciate the presence of a stable surface and the absence of the "wave" effect, when vibrations on one side of the mattress can be transmitted to the opposite side, disturbing the person's sleep.

If a fraudster calls from such a number, like a "police officer" or another law enforcement structure, then it is not effective to immediately hang up, and most likely there will not be time to add it to the blacklist.
Because to confirm his lie about his involvement in the power structures he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to scare and persuade.
More useful recommendations are needed for the people.

The maximum number of awards this time was received by the film Jasmina Å½baniÄ (Bosnia) "Where Are You Going, Aida?".
The main heroine of the film is a translator at the UN mission who is trying to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for the drama "Unclenching Fists" by Kira Kovalenko (a graduate of Alexander Sokurov's workshop), it tells the story of the complex relationships between a domineering father and his children who are trying to free themselves from his control in North Ossetia.

As regular friendly meetings between the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey show, I think you are, to put it mildly, out of the loop.
