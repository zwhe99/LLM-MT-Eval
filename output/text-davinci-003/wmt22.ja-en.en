When I tried to buy an entry package, blue and orange packages came out.
The price is more than double for the orange one.
What's the difference?
I couldn't figure it out by researching, so please tell me.
There should only be blue now.
If there is one, it might just be the old product left.
They are the same, except for the appearance.
Karate vs. Jiu-Jitsu
Who is stronger if they fight with the same height and weight?
Jiu-Jitsu
Generally, karate only practices sparring with each other.
Because Jiu-Jitsu, especially Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, involves practicing dealing with strikes and other elements.

Was the Destiny Plan in "Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny" a retaliation for Durandal being rejected by Talia?

Since there are things like that, I don't feel like watching TV anymore...
Is it because the entertainer was forced to do something? Television is all about entertainers.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there were quite a few scenes where the staff were laughing in the background even when the characters were saying something not particularly funny.
Clearly, it's not funny, but it's creepy that people say "you have to laugh at everything a popular comedian says" as if it's a given.
But if the staff don't laugh, it will ruin the comedian's mood, and it won't be pleasant to work with them.
It's like a black company from the past, that industry is like a physical education association, and some entertainers have too much ego and seem to have a bad attitude, so if they don't do that, they won't be able to survive.
On the other hand, many comedians emphasize the difficulty of their work by saying "Don't belittle comedians" over and over again.
I know that the income is quite low until it becomes popular, but it's like a comedian is standing at the top of the difficult job category, even if it's said every time.
It sounds like a justification for the too high position of comedians in the media and society for the beautification of their own careers.
To be honest, there are quite tough parts in the industry I'm working in, but I feel that things related to the entertainment industry are becoming increasingly unreasonable.
I'm sorry for complaining so much.
It felt like it wasn't good for my body if I didn't let it out like a fart...

The product I ordered from the Tsutaya Net Shop was replaced without my permission.
Summary: I ordered a wireless mouse that was cheaper and the wired version of the mouse arrived, and I was told that if I wanted a refund, I should return it.
Rather than talking about self-made PCs, it's a mail-order trouble, but no matter how I think about it, I can't accept it, so I'll let you write it here since it's a famous place.
The trigger was that I discovered that the MSI wireless gaming mouse was being sold for 3,280 yen (Link to Fish Taku) at the Tsukumo Net Shop Tsukumo Day Sale that started from last Friday.
Since the wired version was the same price at the store, I checked the wired version page to consider the possibility of a price mistake and it was 5,071 yen (Link Taku), so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
The order email was received normally and the shipping email was also received the next day.
In both of these emails and in the purchase history of my page, the name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written.
From the order to the shipment, I thought that the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive at this point since there were no miscommunications or cancellation notifications.
Here is the problem, a few hours after shipping, an email came saying "there was a mistake in the product registration".
According to that email
We were selling the wireless version at a sale price, but it was actually the wired version.
We have already shipped the wired mouse.
Reject the receipt and cancel everything.
2. Return only the mouse and receive a refund.
3. Use the wired mouse as it is.
Choose the response
The wired and wireless versions of the product page are separated, and although the purchase history, email, and delivery note are all written as wireless versions, it seems that they were sent as wired versions without permission.
Isn't it unfair to send a different product than what was purchased without any understanding and then demand a refund if we want it returned?
In the end, I want to retaliate with something if I have to accept a refund, so please lend me your wisdom.

Isolated twice... The only bridge connecting the district to the outside was washed away due to a typhoon and heavy rain. Residents tripled their stockpiled food supplies (Yamaki Town, Fukushima Prefecture) (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Yoshio Matsumoto from Takachiho Hara District, Yamamori-machi, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan Typhoon had a big impact on the lives of 8 people in 3 households.
Mr. Matsumoto: "At first it was like 'Really?'"
"I felt like it was going to be broken off so suddenly, or washed away," The only road connecting the Takachi Plain District, "Takachi Plain Bridge," was washed away by the East Japan Typhoon, leaving 30 households of 11 people in the district isolated.
The residents who were forced to have their water cut off continued to use the JR railway bridge, which was usually not allowed, to transport necessary supplies.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: "Usually I can come to the garden by car, but when I got off the car on the other side, I had to carry it or carry it and cross the iron bridge to come here, so I felt the convenience of the car as a means of transportation." The temporary bridge completed one month later was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months, and the isolated state was restored for several days until the temporary bridge was installed.
It has been two years since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures based on the lessons learned.
Mr. Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases."
"For now, I think we should try to secure at least two to three days' worth of food," We have stocked up on canned food and cup noodles, which can also be used as emergency rations, about three times more than before the disaster.
Ms. Misako Matsumoto: "It's not someone else's business, but since you don't know when a disaster will strike you, I felt again that it's better for everyone to prepare a little bit." On the other hand, Yatsumi Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" of a bridge being washed away.
In order not to forget the lesson, the town started its own initiative from 2021.
Yatsuri Town Education Department, Chief Takahashi Ryūichi: "We have established it as 'Yatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day' and we would like to make October 12th a day to think about disaster prevention measures from next year onwards. We have also made an announcement about it."
I think that awareness of the possibility of unexpected events has increased even more than before.

Experience ParaMarathon in VR (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! News
On December 12, 2021, Tokyo held an event where participants could run a digitally recreated Paralympic marathon course.
This event was opened to experience the new fun of sports and the charm of sightseeing in Tokyo through digital means.
At the venue, running machines and road bikes were prepared, and people who visited the venue put on special equipment and ran on the marathon course of the Paralympics reproduced in the virtual space.
On each tablet projecting the virtual space, one's own avatar appears and it is set up so that one can experience a competition running a marathon course with participants from inside and outside the country, and one can also enjoy sightseeing spots in the city.
The participants said, "The scenery changed so much and it was so much fun!"
"Running through the streets of Tokyo like this, it's tough when you're running, but it's so much fun to be able to run while enjoying it, and I'm glad I was able to do my best to the end while competing with everyone," said the Tokyo official. "We want to make sure people can enjoy it at sports gyms and other places in the future," and they plan to set it up from the beginning of the year.

Be careful when buying a used house!
What are the pitfalls of the "Building Condition Survey System" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
In order to activate the used housing market, the newly established "Building Condition Survey" system is doing well in used housing transactions.
Both the prices of detached houses and condominiums have been increasing, and the renovation market is also expanding.
While the trend of living in one's own home is increasing due to the coronavirus pandemic, there is a concentration of popularity in properties represented by words such as "in front of the station", "near the station", "directly connected to the station", "large scale" and "tower", and this may also be affected by the sharp decrease in newly built properties at relatively low prices.
"View the image of this article. However, compared to overseas, the existing (used) housing circulation share in Japan still remains at a low level."
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) started a survey called "inspection" for the purpose of safe and secure transactions of used housing, by partially amending the Real Estate and Building Transaction Business Law (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which an architect who is well-versed in housing checks the current state including the deterioration of the property and the condition of the building, summarizes it in a report, and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that the introduction of inspection will bring benefits to both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid claims after delivery by conducting a property survey before the sale and purchase transaction, which gives the buyer a sense of security.
It also contributes to the differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, for the buyer's side, it is a system that allows them to understand the condition of the used house they plan to purchase and purchase it with satisfaction, and it seems to be a system with great benefits at first glance.
Under the current system, the main party in charge of building condition surveys is mainly the seller.
In addition, it is important to note that only the announcement of the inspection system was made mandatory.
In other words, the real estate business in charge of the mediation has the obligation to explain whether "an architect can be introduced for the property mediation" or "cannot be introduced", but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
On the other hand, when looking overseas, similar systems have already been established in active used markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom.
Before the sale of a house, the buyer can request a building inspection from an expert called an inspector or building surveyor.
For example, in the case of the United States, depending on the state, 70-90% of the transactions for existing homes are inspected.
In terms of the buyer taking the lead in conducting the inspection, the Japanese-style inspection and its nature are significantly different from the seller-oriented one.
The seller's side will try to show the condition of the building as best as possible, sell it as high and as fast as possible.
On the buyer's side, they are examining the survey contents and thinking of carrying out appropriate repairs so that they can live with peace of mind.
Even with the same inspection, there is a discrepancy between the two parties' objectives and intentions.
Therefore, the following points are pointed out as risks of concern regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of the inspection survey based on the seller-led type prescribed by the country shall be kept to a minimum.
Since it is not a detailed survey, there is a risk of overlooking really important defects ● For the inspection company, the intermediary company (seller) that introduces the assigned project can also be considered a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that inspections with "favoritism" such as not reporting unfavorable survey results to the seller may be conducted.

It was quite tough.
However, I had mentally recovered, so I was full of motivation.
Because I was a researcher and my body wasn't keeping up, I would sometimes fall asleep during work.

In any case, it is important to go to a psychiatric hospital and get proper treatment, as well as to keep a record of your visits (extremely important).
If you have a history of hospital visits, even if you resign for personal reasons, you can change it to a company-initiated resignation with the judgment of a doctor at the Hello Work, so the hurdles to receiving unemployment insurance and so on will be drastically lowered.
Even if it's hard to find a job, or if you want to take a break, you can have peace of mind and heart.

Was Ginza an island?
Five pieces of trivia you can talk about while playing silver bluff (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
This used to be a peninsula back in the day.
As evidence of that ... ..., it's only in Ginza that you can show off a bit of trivia.
Let's introduce you to some interesting Ginza trivia that you'll want to share with someone after you learn it.
Go up Ginza! ?
First infiltration into the Golden Seat
As you walk around Ginza, you can see the traces of its history everywhere, such as strange place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines.
We were walking around Ginza and suddenly the silence that visited us, "This used to be a peninsula back then."
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
The Ginza, the epitome of the bustling streets that created "○○ Ginza" all over Japan, located in Chuo-ku, Tokyo.
Originally, "Ginza" refers to a mint where silver coins were made, and in 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza office located in present-day Shizuoka City was relocated to Edo.
At the time it was called "Shinryōgawamachi", but when it moved to Ginza it became known by its nickname "Ginza".
By the way, it is said that once upon a time, the area near Ginza was a "peninsula" protruding into the sea.
From before the Edo period, the Inari-gawa River flowed into the Marunouchi area from Hibiya, and a peninsula called "Edo Mae-shima" stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula corresponds to the current Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the shogunate in Edo, he filled in the bay and developed the Kyobashi district.
Furthermore, Ieyasu developed the districts and promoted boat transportation by digging canals.
And they cut down the soil and Kanda mountain that had been dug out, and filled in the inlet.
Why not try looking for the monument of "Ginza's Origin" which indicates the site of the former Ginza Ward Office in front of the Ginza Tiffany Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku) if you are interested?
A pilgrimage to the Ginza, known only to those in the know.
Every year, a "Sacred Pilgrimage" known only to those in the know, called "Ginza Hachibushu Shrine Meguri," is held in Ginza.
Among more than 10 shrines, the most noticeable one is probably the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki-za theater.
At the shrine standing at the right side of the Kabuki theater, there are not a few people who visit before and after watching the performance.
On the other hand, "Ryukou Fudou-son" is on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuya, and "Ginza Desse Jizou-son" is on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi Ginza Terrace.
The "Houtou Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", and "Toyoiwara Inari Shrine" are located in the back of the alley and are not very noticeable, but the "Toyoiwara Inari Shrine" is known for being respected by Ichimura Uzaemon, a famous Kabuki actor. The "Success Inari Shrine" located at the entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building 1F is closed to the public except when visiting the Hachioji Shrine.
This shrine tour includes places where Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bosatsu are enshrined, but most shrines have Inari as their enshrined deity.
In front of the shrine, the "Inari Shrine" where the fox welcomes you is built enthusiastically in places where there are many farmers, as it brings the benefit of "abundant harvest of five grains" where rice is well harvested.
This eventually led to the belief that there were benefits to be gained from business prosperity in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, and even in Ginza, Japan's most prosperous city, faith spread.

Two days ago, I went to the dentist because I had a sharp pain when I pressed or touched my front tooth, as if it was hypersensitive.
The nerve has been cut and the hole remains open.
He said it was to get rid of the pain quickly.
Before the treatment, when I touch my teeth, I get a sharp pain, will it get better in a few days...?
The painkiller doesn't work at all...
It will settle down in a few days.
I think now is the most painful.
Take care.
The third day is ending.
Let's write about something good that happened recently.
Because of the coronavirus, it became fun to stay at home and drink a lot of alcohol without meeting anyone.
The Super Play video of the retro game I made at the end of the year and uploaded on New Year's Day was played five times (things are going well in the industry).
While jogging on the first day of the new year, I was adjusting the settings of a smartphone app in the park in the middle of the night and the security guard approached me (first conversation of the new year).

Recruitment Script Compilation Method & Existing MOD Script Modification Method
I looked around quite a bit and tried my best, but I just can't figure out how to do it.
I tried an app for that purpose so I can start from MO2 without running the script source or resources, but I don't understand how to use the tool.
I went through the CKWiki tutorial, but there's only information on how to make a completely custom MOD.
I just want to modify the existing MOD script and recompile it, but why can't I find out how to do it...?
Addendum
Solved it.
In the end, if you're stuck, it's best to reinstall it...
During the Greater East Asia War, were most of the military personnel civil servants of the state?
Almost all of them are not, but all of them are now called civil servants.
Since the military itself is an organization of the state, those who are said to be drafted by conscription are considered to be state civil servants in terms of organization.

[Serious question] How did all the foreigners in Japan find work? [Escaping from dispatch]
My friend is currently looking for programming and IT jobs in the Kansai area (currently on dispatch), but it doesn't seem like there are many jobs in Osaka or other major cities on LinkedIn *sobs*
How did everyone find their jobs?
It looks like they're really stressed out, so I want to help them somehow...
I'm not sure if it's okay to ask here, but I'd be really happy if there was a good suggestion.
Everyone has given such great answers, so I'm very happy.

A male body was found in the Shonai River in Moriyama Ward, Nagoya (Chukyo TV NEWS) - Yahoo! News
On the morning of the 12th, a man was found lying face down dead in the Shounai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya City.
The police are investigating the identity and cause of death of the man.
According to the police, at around 11:30 am on the 12th, a passerby found a man lying face down in the Shoinagawa River in Moriyama-ku and reported it to 110.
The man was rescued from the river, but it was confirmed that he died at the scene.
The police are quickly confirming the identity and investigating the cause of death.
On the other hand, a man in his 70s was found lying in the river in Fukuoka-cho, Okazaki City, and his death was confirmed.
Although there was no disorder in the men's clothing, it is said that there was a bicycle fallen nearby.
The police are quickly confirming the identity while investigating the situation at the time.
Regarding the payment of the non-taxable household allowance in the middle of February, if there is one non-taxable person in the household, will it be paid?

Korean Posco International has acquired Australia's Senex Energy to expand its overseas gas field business, according to Korean reports (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
On the 12th, POSCO International announced that it had signed a stock acquisition agreement with Senex Energy of Australia and an investment agreement towards the acquisition of Hancock Energy and Senex Energy.
Currently, with the procedures such as the approval of the resolution at the shareholders' meeting of Sennex Energy and the approval of the local corporation remaining, the acquisition procedures are scheduled to be completed by March of next year.
This acquisition is the largest global acquisition and merger (M&A) case since 2010, when Posco International was integrated into the Posco Group.
The acquisition amount was 770.9 billion won, and it was decided that Posco International would invest 50.1% and Hanhock Energy would invest 49.9%, respectively.
Posco International explained that the demand for natural gas has been steadily increasing even in the era of energy conversion, and that blue hydrogen based on natural gas is expected to divide the market with green hydrogen, leading to the decision to make this acquisition.
With this acquisition, Posco International will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as personnel for the operation of onshore gas fields in Australia.

Originally, February 11th was the only national foundation day, but now it is a holiday because the current emperor was born in February on the 23rd.
However, since the former Emperor's birthday on December 23 was a weekday, the number of days in the year did not change.
Could the pain in your knee be "osteoarthritis" ?
Different Treatment Methods Depending on the Cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editorial Department: Recently, I have been having continuous knee pain.
What are the possibilities of illness?
Mr. Maruyama: The causes of knee pain can be various, such as injury, joint rheumatism, and gout attacks.
Among them, the most common among Japanese people is "osteoarthritis".
Editorial Department: Does that mean the joint is deformed?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which helps to soften the impact and make the movement of the joint smoother.
However, due to aging, obesity, and intense sports, cartilage can wear down or become distorted.
As a result, it can cause joint deformity and inflammation.
Editorial Department: Does osteoarthritis occur in areas other than the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints of the fingers of the hand, the base, the neck, the waist, the thumb of the foot, and the hip joint.
However, the most common case is knee-related, called "osteoarthritis of the knee".
Editorial Department: So, what kind of structure does a joint have?
Mr. Maruyama: The joint is composed of two bones fitting together with bumps and grooves.
And the part where these two bones face each other is covered with "articular cartilage", and the joint is surrounded by "joint capsule".
Editorial Department: It's a complex structure, isn't it?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes, that's right.
Within the joint capsule there is a tissue called the synovial membrane which produces joint fluid.
This synovial fluid plays the role of a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
It is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for making the movement of the knee smooth, which is why it is said.
Editorial: What symptoms occur when someone develops osteoarthritis?
Mr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage has both viscosity and elasticity, and it plays a role in preventing bones from directly colliding with each other.
It's like a cushion role, isn't it?
However, if this wears down or becomes distorted, it can cause deformity of the joint and inflammation, resulting in pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you sleep?
It's basically pajamas, but when the pajamas are in the wash, I wear something like a tracksuit to sleep!
Even for heavy smokers, are there people who can quit smoking and people who can't quit?
Yes, there are two types.
My acquaintance was a heavy smoker, but they quit completely.
He said he just felt like giving up, so he ended up giving up.

Three Gambling & Games from the "Kaiji" Series that You Can Experience for Real (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The Gambling Manga Series "Kaiji" boasts explosive popularity, mainly among men.
One of the highlights of this work is an extreme game where life is at stake.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes my feet tingle ... ... Challenge the steel beam crossing!
So this time, I'd like to review the Kaiji games that can be played in reality or implemented in planning videos.
■Swamp The pachinko machine "Swamp" featured in the gambling abstinence record Kaiji is full of traps.
In the original work, Kaiji was surprised by the high rate of 4000 yen per ball.
This "swamp" had large traps such as "Kugi no Mori", "Kadou Yakumono", and "3-Step Cruun" set up, and it was said that conquering it was almost impossible.
However, Kaiji used every means possible and in the end resorted to an outrageous plan of placing a vinyl aquarium on the building to cause the foundation to sink and tilt, and he successfully conquered it.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "one ball for 4000 yen", and the difficulty has been lowered, but you can still experience the feeling of Kaiji.
The "Iron Crossing" of the "Human Horse Race" was conducted on the debtors, including Kaiji, as a pastime at the "Star Side Party" hosted by the wealthy.
The debtor advances carefully so as not to fall off the thin steel frame set 10 meters above the ground, competing in speed.
Twelve people can participate and the top two can win the prize, but there are only four steel beams and the safety measures are inadequate, so the possibility of death is quite high.
Although this iron girder crossing is highly dangerous, in addition to being developed as a VR game, it is possible to experience an extremely similar experience at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at the home base of the professional baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi".
This Eagle Bridge is a single iron bridge extending to a point 20 meters (equivalent to 7 floors of a building) high, and "Sky Swing" and "Victory Bridge" are provided ahead of it, so you have to walk there.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Comedian Corera Kōarashi released a video on his own YouTube channel of himself walking across the Eagle Bridge, saying that it was an experience that could be had in Japan, and it became a topic of conversation.
■E Card is a two-player card game.
Play with a total of 10 cards, 1 Emperor card, 8 Citizen cards, and 1 Slave card, divided into Emperor and Slave sides.
This game is very well made, with the emperor being strong to the citizens, the citizens being strong to the slaves, and the slaves being strong to the emperor.
In the play, Kaiji faces off against Tonegawa under the harsh rule that if he loses, he will have his ear cut off.
After a long and hard battle, Kaiji realized that his ears were being read by a device that could detect changes in pulse and body temperature and transmit them, just like the earphones he had put on. In order to confuse Rinkai, he shaved his ears to the extreme and caused his body to show abnormal values, thus winning the battle.
The E-Card is commercially available and can be purchased from Amazon and other stores.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of him playing a game of E-card with actor Ryūya Fujii, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, which caused a stir.
Why not try to experience the feeling of Kaiji?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji, but it is a fact that reading the manga can give you a taste of the feeling.
Why don't you try to feel the world view through the game?
Taking the first step towards the new year, gently pushing forward - a large votive horse of the Tora Shrine in Yamagata Prefecture | Yamagata Shimbun
At the prefectural shrine (Yamagata City) where preparations for the New Year are underway, the large votive horse of the zodiac animal of the next year, "Tora" (Tiger), has appeared.
On the 11th, the Tohoku University of Art and Design students who designed it visited the shrine and a dedication ceremony was held in front of the gods.
The shrine has been commissioning art students from Geiko University to create the original drawings for the ema since the year before last.
This time, from the nine works painted by the nine students of the Japanese Painting Course of the Fine Arts Department, supervised by Professor Suehara Toshimitsu, the work of Yuichi Tsuchiya (22) was adopted.
The large e-ma is 3.3 meters wide and the center is approximately 1.8 meters high.
Tsuchiya said he painted with the image of cherry blossoms gently pushing his back as he stepped into the new year.
Stopping in his tracks, the tiger gazing at the cherry blossom held a wish that he could have the leisure to appreciate the beauty of nature even in a rapidly changing world.
Mr. Tsuchiya's design is also depicted in the ema generally distributed.
Gonnegi Kenichi (44) said, "I think I can be a help for everyone to overcome their difficulties."

Let's think about "Tamano, where I want to continue living" - Proposals from a 4-high school student workshop: San Digital, Yamanashi Shimbun Digital
What will Tamano be like in 2030?
Students representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are working together on a workshop to think about "Living Tamano".
As part of the survey and policy recommendation project of the intermediate support organization "Tamano SDGs Miraizukuri Center", the raw voices of young people are compiled and proposed to the mayor.
"What times are enjoyable?"
In response to the facilitator's questions, the students answer in unison such as "when having fun with many people" and "when playing the drums".
The first event was held at the Sunrise Fureai Hall on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and local people discussed "interesting towns", "livable towns", and "towns where you can feel a sense of purpose" while moving around an "island" with each person assigned a theme, using the "World Cafe" method.
Write down each idea on a sticky note and organize them on a mock-up paper.
"It seems interesting that there are many young people in this town." "Public transportation such as trains and buses is essential for livability."
Are there any common points? Let's discuss further.
"I used to think Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle by the sea is attractive," said 18-year-old Tamano Commercial High School third-year student.
18-year-old students from Binan High School talked with adults, and noticed not only the issues of the area but also its charm, saying "There are few shops and the transportation is inconvenient, but it's a great place with lots of nature."
The second meeting in December will be attended only by high school students to organize the proposals.
We plan to invite the mayor and the director of education and announce it in February next year.
The president of the same center said, "In addition to fostering a sense of attachment to the local area among high school students, it could be a trigger for young people to take the initiative in town development."
In Kanto, a magnitude 5.0 earthquake with a seismic intensity of 4 was reported in the southern part of Ibaraki (Kyodo News) - Yahoo! News
At around 12:31 PM on the 12th, an earthquake of magnitude 4 occurred in Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, and Saitama prefectures.
According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, the epicenter was in the southern part of Ibaraki Prefecture, with a depth of about 50 kilometers.
The magnitude of the earthquake is estimated to be M5.0.
There is no concern about the tsunami.
The intensity of the earthquake is as follows in each area.

How to Find the New Way to Coil a Stole (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
A scarf is essential in winter, but don't you sometimes feel the fabric bunching up around your neck?
After winding, it is good to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror, but sometimes I hear voices that don't quite understand the trick.
I was thinking if there was a scarf that wouldn't wrinkle and could be quickly wrapped around, but then I found something new and innovative.
The COTTORI brand of scarves have a long side of approximately one meter, giving them a more compact size than the average.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Can it really be wrapped up so short?"
Upon closer inspection, it is tailored into one piece as if weaving a long and narrow cut cloth, and the whole is in a net pattern.
The mesh has been designed so that the edges of the stole can pass through it.
Therefore, you can wind it up and secure it without connecting the ends.
It's very light and warm with fleece material.
This year, sleeveless vests (waistcoats) are popular, but many people will combine them with a scarf to keep their shoulders warm.
I think it would be very convenient to have such a stool.

The Beatles documentary on Disney Plus is super interesting.
Get Buck is a Peter Jackson directed one.
It feels like the Beatles in their full-bodied form, fresh in various ways...
We're on the brink of disbanding so there's a tense atmosphere, but it's not the dramatic tension I had imagined.
While trying hard to keep things in order, there was Paul, who was annoying with his "I know I'm annoying, but come on!" attitude, George, who was grumbling with a "But, you know...", John, who was always late and didn't seem motivated, and Ringo, who wasn't very proactive and just sat in the back with a "Oh, this is troublesome" face.
We didn't hate each other enough to fight, but there was a very familiar atmosphere of "Well, it's impossible to work together anymore," and it's interesting to think that the Beatles had that same feeling. What would you call it, a legendary breakdown?
And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance starts, everyone is really overflowing with talent.
The process of starting from a small phrase and gradually building it up to "that famous song" while asking each other "how about this?" is awesome.
Especially the moment when the title track "Get Buck" is finished is amazing.
A subtle hum-hum-hum like a nose song gradually turns into a Zucha♪ Zucha♪ and the scene where the lyrics come in is firmly recorded, it's amazing.
It's amazing that you can see the process of composition like this, it doesn't happen very often.
Of course, it goes without saying that everyone is playing with so much enthusiasm that just watching the performance scene can make you happy.
It seems like only one episode out of three has been released so far, but my impression is that the main cause of the Beatles' breakup was the environment around them rather than the Beatles themselves.
Although the four of them complained about this and that, when they started making music, they seemed to have fun, but when it came to the topic of where to hold the live performance, people like the producer and the promoter started talking in a Beatles-like manner, saying "It's gotta be the best in the world!" and it was easy to see that they had taken the hands of the people themselves.
Well, since documentaries also involve the director's interpretation, it may be that Peter Jackson felt that way...
I thought that maybe Paul supervising it was the reason why there were a lot of scenes where Paul seemed like a villain.

Can I be a pillar?
I can't do it
Do not call out the technique name before performing the technique.
I thought that because you have a serious personality, you have been feeling a sense of responsibility and gradually losing your peace of mind.
I think it's a bit hard to live right now.
I used to be in sales, but I got so sick that I had to switch jobs. I'm not good at initiating sales activities on my own, but I thought I was really suited to sales activities that customers need, so I switched to a different industry and it became much easier to work.
Even though I was asked about what I couldn't do, I think that if I can find something I'm good at or something I can do in my heart, my life will become a little easier in the future.
Of course, I think it's best to take your time and rest so that you can have some peace of mind before considering this.
I think there is also everyday life, so if there are organizations of the company, industrial doctors or consultation windows, it may be that there are some systems if you consult there, so it may be good to consult once.
It would be nice if we could live with a little more ease in the future.

Tornadoes have occurred frequently in the United States, causing great damage, due to the unseasonably warm weather and strong cold air (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From the evening of Friday, 10th local time to Saturday, 11th, tornadoes occurred mainly in the southern United States.
It is believed that due to the strong cold air descending from the record-breaking warmth of this season, the atmosphere has become extremely unstable and cumulonimbus clouds have developed rapidly.
Warm air flowed in from the southwest to the southern United States, resulting in record-breaking high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature has risen close to 30°C on Thursday (9th) and Friday (10th) local time.
Due to the strong cold air below -30°C near 5500m in the sky, a vigorous front was formed due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly in a shape along the front.
It appears that tornadoes are occurring one after another in the vicinity.
The American South is originally an area prone to tornadoes, but from early summer to summer is the high season, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
The tornado warning issued in one day during the winter season reached nearly 150 times, which was a record-breaking number.
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported more than 400 tornadoes and strong winds on Friday alone, local time.
According to this, there are two concentrated areas, one along the southern line from Kentucky to Texas, and one along the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, it is believed that a tornado of EF3 strength on the Enhanced Fujita Scale (modified Fujita Scale), which indicates the strength of a tornado, reached the third strongest level out of six, with instantaneous gusts of wind of around 70 m/s.
According to future surveys, there is a possibility that it will be classified as EF4-5.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the Fujita Scale) is used, based on the Fujita Scale, to match the condition of Japanese buildings.
The JEF3 equivalent to this American tornado has a high possibility of occurring in Japan, and it is at a level where wooden houses can collapse.

From under the "historic largest" rice dragon roll, voices calling for help were broadcast live (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo! News
Regarding the tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the United States, President Biden expressed his view on the 11th (Japan time 12th) with a solemn expression that it was "one of the largest tornadoes in US history".
Reported by US CNN TV and others.
Biden emphasized that "the federal government will do everything it can."
He explained that the full extent of the damage, such as how many lives were lost, is still unknown.
There is a fear that the number of dead will exceed 100.
In Kentucky, which was affected by the tornado, residents carry household items such as furniture from the broken house. From the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least 6 states, including Kentucky.
As for the range of damage caused by the tornado, a record of 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) that caused damage to Missouri and other states in 1925 remains, but a meteorologist from US CNN also estimated that this time it was the largest scale of about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers).
In Kentucky's Meadfield, which suffered great damage, the candle factory that was operating 24 hours in preparation for the Christmas campaign also suffered great damage.
At the time, 110 people were working, but the building was destroyed and no trace remained.
Trapped under a thick pile of rubble about 1.5 meters deep in the darkness, the woman felt the weight of the rescue workers searching above her and asked for help through a Facebook Live broadcast from her smartphone.
In addition to the cries of a woman calling for help in the broadcasted live stream, the sound of "Happy Birthday To You" sung by another woman, seemingly in an attempt to mask her fear, was also heard.
Amber Brown, a convenience store employee living in Mayfield, hid in the basement of her home with her 5-year-old son when a tornado warning was issued and was safe.
"Many people compare it to the sound of a train, but it was a more terrifying sound, like a rumble from the ground," he looked back.
The police officers of Mayfield City Police will continue the search until it is no longer necessary.
He continued the desperate rescue efforts without knowing how many weeks, months, or years it would take.
In Illinois, part of an Amazon warehouse collapsed, resulting in at least 6 confirmed deaths.
The train derailed due to the shock of being detached from the carriages, and the highway is also being blocked one after another due to the effects of vehicle overturning.
According to US web media, approximately 400,000 households, including 130,000 in Tennessee, are without power.
I have a low platelet count.
What should I do to increase it?
Take high-protein foods and drinks
Avoid coarsely cut raw vegetables.
It would be good to do things like that.

Living on welfare is tough...
I'm praying that something can be done.
It would be nice if there were "live-in work" options like inns and resort jobs that could provide both a place to live and a source of income, but it seems like there are few options in the current social situation due to the coronavirus crisis.
I did a quick search and it looks like there's a site like this ↓,
Live-in Part-time Job / Regular Employee Job - Live-in Job Search Navi (Suminavi)
There are "bargain, live-in, job" in the related search, so it seems that there are many colleagues like that.
For bank accounts and line contracts, it seems that it can be done somehow if there is an address only for the first time, but for credit cards (and debit cards that can be treated as credit cards), you can't update it without an address (because a new card is sent to the registered address).
What does a specialist in gynecology mean for a doctor?
"Specialist doctors" are doctors in the 3rd to 5th year after graduation.
It is also called "Specialty Doctor" and "Late-term Training Doctor".
The so-called "resident doctor" refers to a "first-year resident doctor", which refers to a doctor in the first or second year after graduation.
Although it can be said that I am inexperienced, when I reach 4-5 years of experience, I will be able to do certain medical treatments, so I will be entrusted with various tasks.

There has been a long-standing discourse that people have different opinions about the star rating system.
While other countries use a five-star system to deduct points, the claim is that Japan uses a three-star system as a neutral point to add or subtract points.
At the baseline, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars mean completely different meanings, "there are elements that need to be deducted" and "it is not a masterpiece but a good work".
If we set the standard at five stars, then "works with no flaws" and "works at the highest level" are on the same level, so if there is such a tendency, I think it is a system defect not to present the meaning of the stars, but since such a system is actually being used, I understand why you don't want to give three stars (bad reviews).
Therefore, if you try to refute the argument of those who advocate this view with a two-choice evaluation of Steam, the conversation will not fit together.

Is there a submersible pump that can be powered by USB and fit a standard hose size?
The power capacity that can be taken from the USB is up to approximately 2A at 5V, so it is only 10W at most.
The power consumption of a submersible pump varies depending on the model, but at least 500W is required, so it's impossible.
The numbers are vastly different.

The Making of a Homemade Radio
I made an AM radio with my own capacitor and coil, but there was a lot of noise and I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the sound of the radio, but I heard a different radio than the one I tuned to.
The tuning might have been too soft and not heard clearly, but it was different from the expected station, right..
So, getting to the point, I was supposed to make an AM radio, but it seems like an FM radio is coming through.
Why do you think so? Is there such a thing?
Is it okay to delete the Esp of SMIM and Dlizzio's Mesh Fixes?
If the MOD using ESP for distributing textures and meshes is deployed as a loose file in the appropriate location, then it does not need ESP.
I saw a story somewhere about that, but I can't remember where I saw it...
I understand the risks, so I'm not planning to actually do it, but I'm so worried that I can't sleep at night.
I would like to know if it is technically possible.
If anyone remembers, could you please tell me if it's okay to do it?
Thank you for your contribution.

<Saga Eating Record> "Hakobune" "Freshly caught seasonal fish fry and shrimp fry with homemade tartar sauce" | Living/Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Bento box "Freshly caught seasonal fish and shrimp fry with homemade tartar sauce."
"Hakobune," a take-out specialty store with a colorful and abundant bento and deli (souzai) using plenty of vegetables.
Koyuki Takayuki (39) and Yumi (38) couple opened last August with the aim of allowing people to experience the restaurant atmosphere at home.
One of the popular bento menu items is "Freshly caught seasonal fish and shrimp fry with homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
Fish choose the best of what is available at the market at the time.
According to Mr. Kiyoshi, the batter for fried food is made as thin as possible so that the texture of the ingredients can be directly felt. Therefore, the texture of shrimp fried food is crispy and can be directly felt.
The bento box comes with four kinds of side dishes, portioned Hinohikari rice from Saga Prefecture with mixed grains, and soup.
Vegetables are purchased from the self-grown field next to the house or from the direct sales office in the prefecture.
The side dish varies depending on the season, but Mr. Kiyo has studied French cuisine and adds color with dishes such as râpé and ratatouille.
On the other hand, it is a fusion of Japanese and Western styles that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations, such as the "familiar and comfortable taste" of dashi-maki tamago (Yumi-san).
The bento "Hand-kneaded hamburger with domestic mixed meat" (1000 yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, we will also be selling charcuterie sets, processed meats that go well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to stop by Haneda Airport and there was something interesting so I tried it out.
The ride comfort is not that bad, but it occasionally shakes (not to the point of getting dizzy).
Of course, it's slow.
I think it's safe because the speed was reduced when there were people around, and in some cases it stopped completely, but I thought it could be dangerous depending on the location.
The gaze of those around me hurts; it's good to be seen, but it feels like they're saying "you're in the way," and it hurts my heart.
Overall, it's not bad but there is still room for improvement.
It's a shame that it would be easier to use if there were fewer people and if there were more considerations, such as asking them to move to the edge.
Specifically, I thought it would be good to create dedicated lanes so as not to interfere with other people walking.
I thought it was a great vehicle because I could relax and take in the scenery while taking it slow, but it would be better if there were fewer people.
It was a vehicle that was difficult to ride unless you had a strong heart, with a sense of excitement for the near future of whether this kind of autonomous driving will become mainstream and a pleasant feeling of the pain of the gaze of the surroundings.
I was so embarrassed.

If you look closely, you might understand a little bit, but this is an eel bowl without any eel.
Actually, it's "!Eggplant!" (Tap to reveal the answer)
I like eel, but I thought that everyone was just eating it with sauce and that anything other than the grilling would be fine, but then I realized that the texture and amount of eel is actually important.
I don't want the eel to go extinct, but I just wanted to eat eel.
Recipe Used: Eggplant "Unagi" - Woks of Life (Substituted Sansho Pepper for Negi.)
I just fried it in a frying pan with sauce, but it takes about 30 minutes for this simple dish.

One man was cut off and escaped on a motorcycle on the 12th in Saga City's Otsuji, a attempted murder case | Incident | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
At around 1:25 am on the 12th, on the street in Daizai 1-chōme, Saga City, a 40-year-old man from Fukuoka Prefecture was cut with a blade by a man believed to be in his 30s or 40s, and suffered facial injuries.
The man escaped on a motorcycle and Saga South Police Station is pursuing him as a attempted murder case.
According to the South Police Station, there was a 110 call from a passerby saying "they are fighting".
The man sustained an injury about 10 centimeters long and 1 centimeter deep on his left cheek, but he is conscious.
The man who ran away was medium-built with a shaved head.
A weapon believed to have been used in the crime was left near the scene.
It is said that the man was drinking with several acquaintances, and it is being investigated whether there was some kind of traffic trouble between the man on foot and the man on the bike.

The Long Journey of a Family Establishing Environmental Protection Activities on the Chinese Border (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Kato Yuki: Hong Kong Enterprise Find Asia Corporate Consultant) China, with its vast land, is also important in terms of biodiversity, with the number of mammal species being the highest in the world and the number of plant species being the third highest in the world.
There are areas where local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and not only promote environmental protection activities by local governments, but also promote the activities of environmental activists.
Sichuan Province in Southwest China, Xishuangbanna (also known as Sipsongpanna) is also one of these regions.
Ms. Li Wanda, my younger sister, is currently active as an actress. Si Sa Phan Na is a region bordering Laos and Myanmar, and is a region where many ethnic minorities, including the Dai (Thai) ethnic group who share the same roots as the Thai Kingdom, live.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, is flowing.
The Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture of the Dai people (Xishuangbanna Dai) covers only 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of the species of wild animals and 20% of the species of plants.
This time, we had the opportunity to meet Li Minhua in Seychelles and hear about her environmental protection activities on site.
I started environmental protection activities with my German husband - I have been involved in environmental protection activities for 20 years.
What was the trigger for that?
Mr. Li, our environmental protection activity "Tianzi" started in 2000.
The catalyst for that was my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and he came to Seesapanna for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
This is the only tropical rainforest area in China and it was proud of its numerous biodiversity.
On the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
Therefore, in order to root industry in this region and to produce rubber which was lacking in China, large-scale logging of tropical rainforest was carried out previously.
He was dispatched here from Germany for the recovery of natural resources and research of biological resources.
And here I met a journalist I knew and got married.
Before that, did Mr. Li not have any interest in nature conservation?
Mr. Li, I am from Cispanana, but I had no interest in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, I had to push the project forward with my husband without any knowledge.
Even though they don't have a particularly attractive face and aren't particularly tall, I sometimes see people with an aura. Why do you think that is?
A popular actor said.
Aura is not something that comes out when you try to make it come out.
It is something that naturally comes out when you have confidence in yourself.
That person must have a strong sense of self-confidence within them.

I suddenly thought, is it too detailed to compliment someone's outfit or say something like "the colors look nice"?
It's not too detailed, right?
It's something that can be seen.
I don't think it's too detailed.
I haven't been told to praise in detail, so I'm not sure what it means.
What do you mean by praising in detail?
What would you do if you were confessed to by Yokomine Sakura?
"My heart is blooming with joy after being confessed to by Sakura-san, I'll accept your offer," I replied and we started going out.
And, in order to get along, I want to increase my knowledge of golf and share things we both like.
I would like to open a Rakuten Securities account, but if I choose not to open a NISA account now, can I open it at a later time?
It will be completed faster if it is set up at the same time.
It will be completed in about a week.
Furthermore, since there are no fees, we recommend opening a NISA account so that you can use it immediately when you want to.

【Omakan / Personal Notes】It took about a month and a half to identify the cause of the CTD in the MOD self-environment.
In the period from March to GW, due to lack of time to play, multiple CTDs occurred due to multiple factors, and it took a long time to identify them, mainly on holidays.
Why didn't you analyze the log with .Net Script Framework (which would have been understood in a few minutes)? Some errors related to .dll series and mesh do not remain in the crash log.
The main timing of CTD
Leave no trace in the logs of all Papyrus and .Net Script Framework type .dll plug-ins that log.
When accumulating NPC kills/attacks: Activation with console kill → Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree's SE updated re-release) OFF for improvement * Is there a possibility of wet clothing for this?
For some NPCs, camera work when activating kill moves → Setting off kill moves by PC via .ini to improve the basics: Competition in settings related to DAR + Nemesis? However, the upper limit has not even reached 10,000 DAR animations.
(Basic outdoors) During field movement + partial magic (e.g. Ice Rune) activation, when hitting an NPC: Use the Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID NPC application setting (top right of MCM) with all OFF and try 5 times consecutively to improve everything.
Could it be due to additional armor worn by some actors/NPCs or shader settings for body meshes? Also, although there are formatting mistakes in the 2.0 SPID default.ini, it should result in the intended result and the NPCs should have the prerequisite Perk applied.
At first, we focused on checking parts attack and OnHit related motion/combat MOD (.dll) and this is the result we got.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports at least at the English, German, and French levels.
If there were anyone in a Japanese language environment with the same CTD problem, I thought it might be useful as a reference, so I posted it as a memo.
Everyone is doing it with a barely mental state.
Nobody around notices it, not even my colleagues or family.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically, "That person looks like they're having a hard time, but they're working hard and staying energetic."
He is probably on the brink of mental exhaustion.
I haven't retired in name of mental health, but I think I was at my limit just before retiring.
My thoughts on the importance of psychiatric nursing visits-Now that today's visit is over
I have been receiving home nursing care for a long time due to my bipolar disorder, and I think I have developed a very good relationship with the female nurse at the home nursing station I am currently using.
We talk about different things every week.
Of course, they also do what is necessary for medication management (such as packaging), but more than anything, I was deeply impressed by how important it is for people with mental illness to have enjoyable communication through today's home visit nursing.
Today we had a discussion about gender differences, or gender theory, and we even joked around about it.
We also talk about things like male and female sexual desire, or why she got divorced, is that okay to talk about in home nursing?
Occasionally, I also dress up as a woman.
I have heard from acquaintances that in the case of visiting nursing stations operated by psychiatric hospitals, elderly nurses who can no longer work in the ward come and only provide administrative support, or that when an occupational therapist comes to the visiting nursing station, they are given orders from above in a condescending manner, such as "This is a medical facility".
I use a small visiting nursing station managed by a social welfare corporation, and I think the nurses are really good because they face me on an equal footing and frankly with my mental illness.
By the way, she's beautiful, haha.
There are those who are receiving psychiatric home visits and those who are considering receiving them.
Home visits by nurses are very beneficial for people with mental illness.
If the doctor approves, let's definitely take it.
Let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I have had to cancel contracts from my side because they just didn't fit.
Sorry for the bad writing.
I knew it was a false alarm, but I was startled when it came out in English.
Why does it come out in English?
There are several suspected causes, for example...
I don't know what will be displayed in Japanese by the person who made it.
Language detection malfunction
The browser settings are set to English priority.
The ranking of the least number of appearances in the lottery 6 draw is all odd numbers.

Repeating or continuing.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, I have switched to teleworking.
But I can't concentrate on work at home.
I get anxious and immediately reach for my cell phone.

South Korea's Hydrogen Technology Patent, One Fifth of China's... "Delayed in Implementing Hydrogen Economy Roadmap" (Central Daily Japan Version) - Yahoo! News
In 2019, the South Korean government announced a Hydrogen Economy Roadmap.
The content was to spread 65,000 fuel cell vehicles by 2022 and operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6,000 won per kilogram (approximately 577 yen).
However, as of November this year, fuel cell vehicles have not reached the target level of 27% (approximately 17,000 units).
The schedule for the spread of hydrogen stations for core infrastructure is 38% (about 117 places) of the target, and the price of hydrogen per kilo is 8400 won, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It has been revealed that the government's progress in implementing its hydrogen economy roadmap is significantly below the target value.
The Japan Association of National Economy (Zenkeiren) announced its report "Current Status and Policy Direction of Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem" on the 12th.
According to the report, the reality is that the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on countries such as the United States and Japan.
The carbon fiber core material of fuel cell vehicles is supplied by Toray (Japan), the platinum catalyst is supplied by Kyocera (Japan), and the membrane is supplied by DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), 3M (USA), etc.
The number of hydrogen technology patents held by the six countries (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) that lead the global hydrogen market has increased by an average of 14% (since 2014).
In the field of hydrogen production and fuel cell patents (cumulative from 2014 to 2020), South Korea is ranked fifth in the world.
However, the All-Japan Federation of Economic Organizations conveyed that "in fact, six countries occupy the majority of the world hydrogen market, meaning that they are lower-ranked among competing countries."
The country-specific patent ranking is China, the United States, the EU, and Japan in that order.
Since China overtook the United States to become the number one in 2017, it has been widening the gap.
In 2020, the number of patents registered was 1033 in South Korea, surpassing Japan (974) and ranking fourth, but it was only 22% of China (4721).
The Zenkyoren proposed that "Hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'National Strategic Technology' with a large tax deduction for equipment investment and research and development expenses."
It has been a month and a half since the surgery was done by cutting the tendon of the finger.
Currently, I am in rehabilitation, but the surgical scar is slightly swollen and it hurts when I move my hand in the affected area.

It will heal naturally, but it will take some time.
Even if it hurts, if you don't do rehabilitation, you won't be able to move, so let's do rehabilitation, okay?

Was the number of female wives from Meiji to Showa compared to now a minority?
It seems that my sister had many wives.
It has become so common that the phrase "sister-in-law wife" is being said around.
And, it seems that in those days, since it was said that "even if you wear a golden headscarf, look for a wife older than you," there were more wives older than now in the Meiji and Showa eras.

Is it a crime to sell items at a higher price than the regular price in a store?
Today the PS5 was being sold at the store for 70,000.
It is legal.
For example, in a free market competition, if the brand item increases in scarcity value compared to the list price.
For example, it is considered legal for a painter to become famous and for their prices to rise.
The high price of the PS5 is due to its rarity value, and its value has increased from the list price.

The Town Council of Takasu is working on unique council reforms, such as creating an unusual flyer to announce regular meetings and introducing a "communication book" for citizens to evaluate council members.
The town council election is a consecutive three-term no-vote, aiming to get the townspeople to take an interest.
To inform about the Sunday Council to be held on the 12th, 1800 new flyers were distributed through newspaper inserts on the 9th.
"Live Giron from the Morning" "Tetsuko's Room" "Sawaguchi Hito Exploration Series" ... .
The flyer distributed by the town council on the 9th had catchy phrases reminiscent of popular TV shows.

US aid weapons and ammunition have arrived in Ukraine, and troops are also engaged in training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) US State Department officials reported that equipment including small arms and ammunition arrived in Ukraine based on a security assistance plan approved by President Biden by 12th.
The military assistance is equivalent to a total of 60 million dollars (approximately 6.8 billion yen), and the last equipment including four radars to identify the launch points of mortars, etc., will be transported to Ukraine at the beginning of the year.
According to Kirby, the spokesman for the US Department of Defense, these aid packages included lethal weapons such as anti-tank missiles "Javelin".
The purpose of military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities, such as the increase in forces carried out by the Russian military around the Ukrainian border.
The US is strengthening its vigilance against the movements of the Russian military, and is also discussing with NATO member countries and drawing up plans for how to respond if Russia launches an invasion of Ukraine.
President Biden approved the arms aid when President Zelensky of Ukraine visited the White House in September this year.
US military aid to Ukraine reached approximately 450 million dollars this year.
Since Russia forcibly annexed the Ukrainian Crimea Peninsula, the total amount of aid has exceeded 2.5 billion dollars.
The US military is also involved in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, in accordance with a multinational joint training program to support Ukraine, state troops from the US state of Florida were dispatched.
According to a statement from the US Department of Defense, the US Special Operations Forces in Europe have played a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US special forces operating in Ukraine is not disclosed as a confidential matter for the execution of the operation.
President Biden held an online meeting with President Putin of Russia on the 7th of this month, and there was a tense exchange of words regarding the situation in Ukraine.
The United States is also showing a stance of imposing severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The fate of the inheritance and gift tax "review" to make "forbidden hands" of pre-mortem gifts, directly hitting Masaru Amano, former Tax Commission Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party!
The first special feature of the December 18th issue of Weekly Diamond is "Talking with your family during the New Year holidays!"
It is called "Advance Gift and Rush Inheritance Technique".
While the discussion of the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax is progressing, it was not included in the tax system reform outline for the 2022 fiscal year that was a concern, but there is a high possibility that the pre-death gift, which is the orthodox measure for inheritance tax countermeasures, will become a "forbidden hand" in the near future.
How will the rules of succession change?
Along with a direct hit to the former Tax Commission Chairman and House of Representatives Member, Kanemaru, I will impart everything from the basics of gifts and inheritance tax to tax-saving techniques in order to make it in time for the end of the year and get a good deal on the rush gift.
(Diamond Editing Department, Kei Miyahara)
From wealthy people to urban company employees, "forbidden hands" are used for pre-death gifts, and "from the perspective of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax more integrally, we will proceed with full-scale consideration towards the construction of a neutral tax system for the selection of the timing of asset transfer".
The announcement of the 2021 Tax Reform Outline by the ruling party last year caused a great disturbance not only among the wealthy but also among the middle class.
This is because the implication of what is being said is that the rules of succession will be changed, and the "gift before death" which is the orthodox way of dealing with inheritance tax will be prohibited, leading to a large increase in inheritance tax.
The iron rule of tax reduction measures for the highly progressive inheritance tax is "to reduce the taxable property".
The pre-mortem gift, which is the strongest trump card, has been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by company employees who have a small amount of inheritance tax generated in the three major metropolitan areas.
In the midst of this, the discussion of "integration of inheritance tax and gift tax" emerged.
Although it was not included in the Tax System Reform Outline announced on December 10th, which was concerned about the fastest introduction, the policy towards integration was re-established with more detailed wording such as "review the current inheritance tax system and calendar year gift system" and "the non-taxation measures of gift tax are a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limit (omitted) and will continue to be reviewed".
Former Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, Masaru Amari, the former chairman of the Tax System Research Council, said in an interview with the editorial department.
It is most important to avoid advantages and disadvantages depending on the timing of asset transfer, and to keep the tax burden the same no matter when it is done.
Currently, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise from integration. If we make the fastest amendment, there are only three chances left for pre-mortem gifts.
Even without that, it seems certain that in the near future, a large step will be taken in the direction of invalidating lifetime gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So, how exactly do the rules for inheritance tax and gift tax change?

"My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10, 2022. Yudai Furukawa: "Please look forward to it!"
It has been decided that FOD original drama "My Righteous Older Brother" starring Yudai Furukawa will be broadcast on terrestrial television from late night on January 10, 2022 on Fuji TV.
【Photo】The heroine, Kanon Yamaya, stars in this heartbreaking pure love story based on the same-named manga by Morie Satoshi, which was serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" from 2018.
The protagonist, Kairi, is played by Furukawa, and the heroine, Risae, is played by Yamayagi Kanjū.
Riso, a college student, meets her senior at her part-time job, Kairi.
Kaori, who is troubled by insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly when he borrows Ryo's shoulder for some reason.
Risae is drawn to Kairi, who has a similar appearance to her brother who was separated from her parents due to their divorce, but could Kairi be a murderer due to a certain trigger?
Yuudai Furukawa commented that the drama "My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10th!
Those who were unable to watch FOD should look forward to it, and those who have already watched it can gain a deeper understanding of the work by watching the complex psychological portrayal of Kairi and Risae, as well as their struggles and changes.
I am happy if the original fans can also enjoy it.
Look forward to it!

After the team won the NFL game with only three passes, what were the players feeling and how? (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
In this game, Jones threw only three passes for the Patriots.
This was the fewest number of passes since the Bills recorded two passes in Week 3 of 1974 in their game against the New York Jets.
In the 1974 Bills, there was an unprecedented genius RB, O.J. Simpson, who had exceeded 2000 yards for the first time in history in the previous season.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with their run game of Simpson and another RB, Jim Braxton.
The biggest reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border, and its latitude is the same as Kushiro in Hokkaido.
And on this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, with a wind speed of 18 m/s, and it was snowing before the game.
Since the Bulls were from the local area, they didn't change their play selection much.
Pass 30 times versus Run 25 times.
Allen's pass was 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no interception and it was certainly not bad.
There were four red zone penetrations in the 10 offensive series and scoring opportunities.
Especially in the late third quarter, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, they only managed to score three points in one FG in the three times.
Defense in front of the goal in the final minutes of the game.
The Bills, chasing 4 points, committed a penalty on 3rd & 9, making it 3rd & 14.
The goal is 18 yards away.
At 3rd and 14, QB Allen was surrounded by the Patriots defense rush and flowed out to the right from the pocket.
Then he threw a pass aiming for TE Dorson Knox in the end zone, but it failed.
In this play, Ace WR Stephon Digs was running a slant-across and was free in front of the end zone, but it didn't seem to register in Allen's eyes.
On 4th&18, Allen targeted WR Gabriel Davis running in from the left side of the endzone, but the pass was batted away by Patriots DB Miles Bryant, ending in failure.
Bryant was man-to-man covering Bills WR Cole Beasley, but midway through he saw Allen's movement and released Beasley to react to the pass.
Allen overlooked two receivers and threw a pass aiming for the end zone twice.
The 4th down pass might have been predetermined, but there was no need to aim for a TD on the 3rd down.
You need to get a first down in two plays.
Since it was still two minutes before, if he had made it to 4th and Short, Allen's own running ability should have come alive.

It's time to replace the items that have been in the kitchen for a long time - here are three items to choose from (Harper's BAZAAR).
Sponge
No matter how often you change it, it is probably not as often as recommended, it is probably the sponge.
From research in 2017, it is known that even if a kitchen sponge is sterilized in a microwave every day, bacteria still proliferate in large numbers (even so, it is still recommended to sterilize it in the microwave).
The German researcher who conducted this study recommends changing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
Cutting board
The US Department of Agriculture has pointed out that when the cutting board starts to show signs of wear and tear, such as scratches and grooves, it should be replaced.
Once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, because bacteria multiply.
If it's still okay, don't forget to disinfect frequently with a solution of one tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in one gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in liquid for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and dry naturally or lightly pat with a clean paper towel to cut off the water and dry.
Dishes that are chipped or cracked
It may be painful to dispose of your favorite mug, but the broken surface can become a new breeding ground for bacteria and viruses.
In addition, it can also be the cause of cutting lips or spilling drinks in the missing part.
Yes, it's a chance to buy a new favorite mug!
Submerged Righteous General Guan Yu, Submitter: Builder Yu Jin
Submerged General Guan Yu: "Oi, Yu Jin!"
No smoking.
"Yukin won't die even if 30,000 arrows come raining down."
"Ussu"
"Even if you get run over by a Tiger tank, you won't die."
"Ussu"
"You won't die even if you get swallowed up by the muddy waters of the Han River."
"Ussu"
"So can we hold out for three quarters of an hour in the underwater bridge assault?"
"Ussu Ussu"
"So let's practice so that we can endure until the next battle of Fancheng!"
"Ussu!"
Is it a promise?
"I understand!"
"Someday you might be killed by Cao Cao and I won't even know!"
Saying that, the righteous general left.
Of course, there's no way we're doing water attack, water bridge three quarters practice! We absolutely can't do it unless we put handcuffs and shackles on and sink into a cage.
Did you read the article at the link even though you quoted from the beginning of the article?
Community market and trade are two different things.
At the Community Market, we use the Steam payment system.
This feature allows for cash transactions with strangers, so there are people who have been victims of scams where they are left with only the item and no money paid.
That won't happen
Trade is a feature that allows you to exchange items or give them as gifts, but there is no buying and selling function.
Is occupation and employment type a different conversation?
I don't understand why you think it's the same story.
There are cases of regular employees even in simple labor, and there are also cases of non-regular employees even in intellectual labor.
Help, FlashBIOS won't finish
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X, so I replaced the B550 and Tomahawk I bought in September.
I went to the BIOS settings screen once, but when I saved the settings and restarted, the screen went black with a white cursor-like dot that stayed on without blinking.
I tried to rewrite using FlashBIOS thinking that the BIOS was damaged, but it won't finish at all.
According to MSI's blog, it seems to take about 5 minutes to finish, but it doesn't end in an hour.
Possible causes could be an old USB memory or using an SD card with an adapter.
Have you overslept and become sluggish?
Are there any other causes that are similar to that?
Do you dislike men with a poker face all the time?
Oh! I saw an acquaintance.
He always had a face like a bagel bond.
I wasn't particularly disliked.

For some reason, it's embarrassing to have brand-name items.
If it is not a conspicuous item, you can have it, but you cannot have something like Louis Vuitton with the monogram written with Lv.
Why?
I think it's best to get something that fits your size.
By the way, I think it's good if it's Japan.
In Japan, it is.
It has nothing to do with gaijin style.
It's better to say it sooner, "Why am I the only one you're talking to in a rude way?"
If they say it doesn't matter because they're a foreigner, it's best to simply say it's unpleasant.
I don't think I'm dreaming of feeling uncomfortable with a fairly good probability.
I was living abroad halfway, but the Japanese who went out, including me, disliked the Confucian etiquette from top to bottom, and there were quite a few people who came, and I wondered if the tag had come off, and I had a misunderstanding that I could say anything to the locals.
If it looks like it to Westerners, I think it's without any malice, more like a kind of spoiledness or a friendly attitude.
Even though my friends are from Europe and America, I sometimes get a little confused when speaking in Japanese about whether to use their first or last name.
Well, it's still okay if it's a friend.
It's probably just ordinary behavior, but if you overlook it, it might become an exception and you won't be able to stop it, so it's better to say it now.
Can you talk to me according to the rules of Japan because it is Japan?
Study: My white friend who naturalized has a habit of raising his glass higher than the others at drinking parties, even though it's unrelated.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but if I do it that way, I don't get strangely treated by people younger or older than me, so I think it's a good habit to be treated like a Japanese person.
No matter the personality, there are people (including me) who pay attention to such small details, so it's annoying.

Thank you for 50 subscribers!
When I opened Reddit today, this newly created sub had surpassed 50 subscribers.
I'm so happy.
Thank you to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, as of yesterday, the number of subscribers was 25 people, so I thought it would take a little longer to get to 50 people, but for some reason 25 people subscribed today, so I'm really grateful.
People who subscribed to this suble today, it would be greatly appreciated if you could tell us in the comment section where you found out about this suble! (I have no idea so I'm really curious)
Currently, there is only one person creating threads, so it would be greatly appreciated if everyone could create threads as well.

I only have the ability to understand a little English, so I will judge based on the translated text only.
The translated text feels a bit off in terms of the wording, but I understand what it's trying to convey and I think it's at a level where it won't be an issue when playing (I'm just saying this based on how I feel, so it might be a good idea to ask other people too).
You often see translations of this level in games produced overseas, and if it's a small company, it feels like it's well translated.
I think that for people who are not native Japanese speakers, it may take a long time of studying to understand the subtle nuances of the Japanese language.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level where Japanese people don't feel uncomfortable, I think it would be better to look for someone else.

Consideration: Training is the battle in "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba".
"Equivalent Exchange of Effort" is a Human Praise <Anime "Yukaku Hen" Commemoration Start> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
What makes the manga "Demon Slayer" particularly unique among recent shonen manga is the fact that there is an excessive amount of training.
It is a common belief that the training arc, where there are no battles day or night and only training, is not popular among readers.
It can be inferred from the fact that the two-year training of the Straw Hat Pirates was only touched upon and the rest was glossed over in the same Jump manga "ONE PIECE".
Well, one-piece is one of the attractions of wandering land, but there are times when "staying in the same place and training" is not compatible.
Now, the training of the protagonist of "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba", Tanjiro, began with him kneeling before Tengen Uzui, who had saved his life, and begging for the life of Nezuko, who had tried to take his life, to which Tengen said, "Do not give the power of life and death to others!"
The weak have no rights or choices, they are only forced down by the powerful... ... .
While saying that, it was Yoshiyuki's kindness to introduce Rin Takizaki, the "trainer" who trains those who wish to join the Demon Slayer Corps (even though he is not good at communicating his intentions).
The first contact between Tanjiro and Rengoku was when Rengoku asked Tanjiro "What would you do if your sister ate a person?" and Tanjiro was at a loss for words, to which Rengoku replied with a single punch, "You're too slow to decide."
Among the fans, it's an unreasonable exchange that looks like a gossip at first glance.
However, walking with a sister who has become a demon carries the possibility that a moment may come when such a judgment is forced upon them.
It could be said that initiation is the preparation of the mind before entering into practice.
Rin Takadzukuri orders Tanjiro to take him to Mt. Hagaromo, even though Tanjiro is still an inexperienced novice, and tells him to descend to the foot of the mountain before dawn.
The mountain is full of pitfalls such as air holes, stone-throwing machines, and traps, and it seems like you will die before you even start your training.
Even so, with his sharp sense of smell, he can detect the faint smell of a trap set by a person, and somehow manage to avoid it, which is barely enough to be called the "protagonist correction".
Nevertheless, it is the essence of Demon Slayer that allows Tanjiro to say "But I can't suddenly become physically stronger enough to avoid all of it!"
Ordinary humans do not suddenly become stronger without any proof, and awakening is only being able to use the "power and skills honed up to that point" with its original potential.
"The equivalent exchange of effort," which rewards those who put in effort and gives nothing to those who do not, is a human anthem that differs from the supernatural power of a monster with no basis, and is a difficult rule that is consistent throughout this work.
Is this old?
Sleeping on the floor directly with a mattress, futon, and quilt, instead of sleeping on a bed.
Because it's not an apartment.
I do that too.
If you want to use the room widely, it is better to sleep on a futon than a bed.
I think there are a lot of people like that.
Will you be strict?
Is it tough for people who work part-time and want to work full-time, juggling between different stores?
No, I don't particularly think so.
In such a case, it does not fit my idea of "strict".
I think of it as "gumption" to devise a plan to get more benefit than effort with the minimum effort.

Samsung Electronics of Korea has established a new "DX Department" integrating home appliances and mobile devices, emphasizing "user experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following Samsung Electronics' integration of its CE and IM divisions into a single Set division, the company announced on the 12th that it has decided to name the division DX (Device eXperience) and will reflect this in its organizational restructuring at the end of the year.
It can be read that the purpose is to enhance the user experience through a variety of services ranging from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics revealed that the newly established DX department is composed of business units such as VD (Visual Display), home appliances, medical equipment, MX (Mobile eXperience), and network, which were integrated from the CE and IM departments.
Samsung Electronics' representatives explained that the name change this time reflects a medium- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthening of global leadership.
In addition, it was emphasized that the products, such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication facilities, as well as services and solutions that reflect the needs of customers, will enable consumers to enjoy an optimized experience with ease.
With the launch of the integrated leadership system, a strategy was also reflected in the name to create synergies on a company-wide scale and build a foundation for differentiated products and services beyond organizational boundaries.
Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy through the "Multi Device Experience (MDE) Conference" to enable users to freely use content and services through interlocking of devices such as IoT and AI-based home appliances and smartphones.
Does 1500BCE mean before the Common Era?
What would it be like to say it in Japanese?
It was around 1500 BC.
BC stands for Before Christ, but out of consideration for people who are not Christian, there has been an increase in the use of BCE in recent years based on the idea that it should be written this way.
BCE stands for Before Common Era.

Although there are matters of preference, I don't think the "desu/masu style" would be suitable for a natural science documentary with a male narrator with a low voice.
I would like it to be expressed more heavily and seriously.
They lie in wait, their jaws ready, with only their armored heads visible from the sand... anything that falls into their trap is impaled and pulled beneath the surface.
The larvae of the mantid always lie in wait in the sand in order to catch their prey, only exposing their disc-shaped head from the sand.
This is a bit unnatural.
The larvae of the mantid always lie in wait in the sand, ready to catch their prey, with only their disc-shaped head peeking out from the sand.
I think it should be so.
What I'm concerned about
Did you refer to any other documentaries?
Are we looking from an ant's perspective?
I wonder.
Translating "armoured heads" into "circular head" would make the part "a giant monster wearing an armor of an ant's scale" disappear, right...?
Aichi 24-vehicle collision, trailer driver has no pre-existing illness, was it carelessness? (TV Asahi Network (ANN) - Yahoo! News)
It has been revealed that the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent for prosecution in the accident in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, in which 24 cars collided, had no chronic illness and that the accident was likely caused by some kind of carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles including trucks and passenger cars collided on National Highway 41 in Komaki City, resulting in 12 people sustaining minor injuries.
The police arrested Nomura Katsuyasu (54), who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of causing the first collision accident and injuring a 71-year-old man, and sent him to the prosecutor's office on the morning of the 12th.
The trailer of Nomura suspect continued to move without stepping on the brakes even after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that the Nomura suspect temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, Nomura suspect had no illness and it was found that some kind of carelessness was the cause.
The police are searching the premises of the related parties and investigating the situation in detail at the time.

Review of Kinnikuman X (Volume 4) (Weekly Pre-News) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which started from Volume 3, will be concluded in this Volume 4!
In contrast to the previous volume which depicted the journey from the opening to the semi-finals in one go, this volume is packed with new gimmicks due to its focus on only one battle!
●"Kinnikuman Volume 4" Reviewer Name: Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ●The Superhuman Pro-Wrestling has already started even before the match!
In a word, this four-volume set is a book that carefully and carefully depicts the decisive battle between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but first of all, it should be noted that it is not a volume that only depicts the match on the ring.
Starting from the signing ceremony, we have a tug-of-war competition and special training scenes that are quite different from before, but that doesn't mean it's boring.
As the tension of the start of the century's war gradually increases in the work, it certainly leads to the excitement of the readers, and I can't help but marvel at the fact that even this period was carefully calculated for the production.
And before the important final, there is one more match that cannot be missed, the 3rd place deciding match between Teriman and Ramenman.
In addition to the luxuriousness as a battle card, what I like is that before the match, Ramenman faces the Kinnikuman poster and says, "From now on, I'm the one to be targeted!!"
He tried to chop it down.
However, Terryman, who happened to pass by, received the sword and prevented it, and the scene ended with a silent stare and the two parting ways.
What's amazing about this is that both have already been eliminated, so there is no longer an opportunity to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there is such a passionate debate about Kinnikuman.
If I'm shown something like this, I can't help but think of a distant future of success!
When a character stands up, it is a scene that I, as a manga artist, still feel deeply even now!
The fight between the two of them ended without taking up much time, but the highlight of the scene was the appeal of Ramen Man's tears after the match.
"Do not underestimate the power of God's luck towards Kinnikuman!"
It's a line of dialogue.
This could be called a grand meta-statement about the work itself, I think readers have been feeling that Kinnikuman has been winning somehow without relying on his strength, because he is the protagonist after all and can't lose.
But by making this statement to Ramenman, Yudetamago-sensei had already taken the initiative and driven home the point that he could no longer use that hand.
With this one phrase, the reader is thinking, "Wait, does that mean Kinnikuman will defeat Robin with his own strength?"
How do you do it?
It will also stimulate our imagination to the unpredictable development, and from the perspective of the author, this is like a line of dialogue that the teacher who creates the work has imposed on himself.
Wow, you did an amazing thing.
I definitely think this is one of the major points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend held in Takahama Town Aoba Mountain (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Aoba Mountain Herbal Village in Takahama-chō Nakayama, the first winter illumination has started, and the park is enveloped in a gentle light.
(December 12th) The winter illumination that started on November 26th is decorated with 50,000 LED bulbs, including a 20-meter-high cedar tree, along the promenade and lawn.
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture said, "We were surprised to come to Fukui after such a long time and find this place."
She said it was very beautiful and she felt relieved.
Illumination was first planned to make people feel healed while avoiding crowds, and it is lit from 5 pm to 8:30 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25th.
On the final day, the 25th, there are plans to hold a Christmas event with button pot and movie screenings.
I think that there are only a few people who can read through the documents in order.
My friend who can read a lot told me that he was able to do it, but he was slowly solidifying the basics of Linux and rather than reading the documentation, he was reading from the table of contents of the reference book and reading the parts that interested him.
It is easier to understand and apply if you learn from Linux rather than starting with something abstract like Docker.
It's quite tough to suddenly understand everything after skipping that part.
If you understand, that's good.
You don't have to do it in order.
Instead of memorizing the contents, just remember the parts you skimmed over and read them when necessary.
I had been repeatedly breaking things down without reading anything at all, so I gradually started to read.

The Yonezawa Agricultural Promotion Association is broadcasting a net distribution and livestock product PR from Yonezawa, Yamagata Prefecture.
The Okishima Agricultural Promotion Council, composed of cities, towns, and JAs in the Okishima area, launched a PR campaign for agricultural and livestock products using "Live Commerce," which distributes video over the Internet while selling products, on the 11th.
The Tokyo Minato Market TV, which was first planned by the Minato Ward, had the Yamagata Aizen Bu Shoudai remotely appear and deliver the charm of the region along with its special products.
The "Okitama x Minato Opening Port Project", a collaboration between the Oki-tama area and the Minato Ward, has been decided to set up a store through the connection, and was broadcast from the Satoyama Vision House in Minami-Harunomachi, Yonezawa City.
Ms. Mika Kuroda, who is active as a "Satoyama Sommelier", wears a Nitorito (Nitorto) brand stole from Yonezawa Weaving and introduces the charm of the area surrounded by nature.

Unfortunately this morning...
The power of the NAS PC has gone out 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
~What happened~
In the morning, open the window for ventilation.
The PC is powered on at this time.
2.) After a while, when I returned to the room, I noticed a sound like a pink rotor coming from the PC, so I shut it down for the time being.
At this point, it was thought that the fan movement was only affected by the decrease in room temperature (6°C).
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) Not starting up.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp will light up for a moment and the fan will start to move but will soon stop.
After that, he said nothing.
Even after unplugging the power plug and trying again, it still only lights up for a moment.
4.) Even after connecting only the motherboard and ATX20 pin, 4 pin and removing all other parts, the system still does not boot.
5.) Since there was a sound like "bubbububububu" as if something was hitting the PSU, I suspect that it might be the cause.
I'll try to find an ATX power supply that's left over and give it a try the day after tomorrow.
Probably.
What should I do if it doesn't work?

I have brought it in once, but even though it is in Saitama-ken Misato-shi, they won't collect it for free from Saitama-ken.
Relatively new ones are free.
Inverse Net
I haven't used it before, but it seems like Sagawa offers free shipping with cash on delivery.
I would like to hear the opinion of anyone who knows about it, as I am thinking of trying it out.
Large garbage (paid) and additional information> Municipal collection box (small appliances free of charge)
Sell it second-hand.
Addendum > Mercari, Hard Off
Are there people who sell things at flea markets or auctions? I've never sold a used PC.
It might be a wise choice to sell while it is still worth money.

The broken printer that no one will take, the old UPS, etc. have become a nuisance.
Since it's not bulky waste, it probably won't cost money, but it's being put off for some reason.
I'm collecting coins as a hobby.
Could someone please tell me how much this coin is worth?
Coins circulated in foreign countries have no value...
In Japan, bills can be exchanged but coins cannot be exchanged.
Since commemorative coins contain gold, they have value.
Even if they haven't done anything wrong, there are still people you don't like, right?
Yes, it's natural to have likes and dislikes because we are human.

She can't do it, is she being discriminated against by her face?
It's not the face, it's the heart.
But it's sad that you can judge by appearance.
It can't be seen on the surface.
What did you do with your school gym uniform after graduation?
I usually wear it as everyday wear ^_^
I threw it away right after graduation.
Before we started living together, she was wearing pajamas, haha.
Is it possible for someone to become a "Riajuu" at any age, even if they are over 90 or 100 years old?
Though all lust and youth will be lost.
If you are healthy.
Men's Volleyball advances to the finals tournament for the first time in 29 years! / Men's Fencing, Freel finishes in 4th place and does not win a medal.
Dragon God Japan, 8th place after 29 years! The men's volleyball Japanese national team advances to the final T. Coach Nakagaki: "It was a big goal."
When I got taken in the third set with the referee challenge x2, I thought it was over, but I won the full set.
The men's fencing foil team failed to win a medal for Japan, losing to the United States.
It seems like the opponent until the semi-finals was in a different class, but why is that opponent in the 3rd place deciding match?
I would like to plant a tree that will provide privacy in the garden, so if you have any recommendations, please let me know.
As a hope, it would be better if it was a evergreen tree that was easy to take care of and preferably one that bears fruit.
Thank you in advance.
To get fruit on a feijoa tree, it is best to plant other fruiting trees such as olives, blueberries, and plums nearby to help it bear fruit.
How much savings do we need to live together without any difficulty?
Everyone is different.
It depends on where you live and what kind of relationship you have.
It would be better to end cohabitation.
There is a high possibility of parting.
It is best to make a proper matchmaker, hold a betrothal ceremony, go to various bridal events, and have a wedding ceremony and reception.
Cohabitation has no benefits.
I think it would be better to stop...
Today I went to the game center and played an arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Ganbarizing.
Oh! I thought it was a legendary rare, but it was a re-recorded legendary rare (^_^;)
Is there any game that uses cards like Ganbaraging as a hobby?
I think it's a ant.
