At the Zhejiang University Academic Annual Conference, students sang the main role and the research results opened up people's minds - Xinhua News Network
Washing hands with air, sniffing to diagnose diseases, accurately searching for the source of smog. At the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University yesterday evening, a series of brain-opening academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, and the research covers major fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical care, life science, humanities and education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biological Sensors: Your Home Physical Exam Doctor
Doctoral student Zhang Diming from the Biomedical Engineering College demonstrated an intelligent mobile phone-based biosensor, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to take a deep breath and this instrument can detect your body's health condition from the components of the exhaled air."
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the smartphone.
Smart bracelets that can detect health conditions on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses graphene, a new type of material, as its target material for chemical elements. Its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Intelligent surgical lamp: the high-energy eyes of the doctor
In addition to smartphones, intelligent surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver medal at the 44th Swiss Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year.
Masters students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the College of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up a new perspective on the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented the intelligent LED shadowless lamp.
"Many diseases are related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room due to inadequate early detection and removal."
Shen Junfei said that, for example, in the early stage of cancer detection, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissues in time, then the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp panels, which can enhance the distinction of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size of the light spot, the brightness, the spectrum, the color uniformity and the shadowless rate according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital and Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: saving water and looking cool.
Ordinary people just wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students have invented a set of "air hand washing device".
As soon as we stand on the apparatus washbasin, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump."
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with the water.
"So, we can get our hands clean!"
The colorimetric test and bacterial residue test prove that the effect of handwashing by this method is the same as that of ordinary handwashing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can not only ensure the cleaning degree, but also save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the Second Global Grand Challenge Summit, this invention stood out among many world-renowned universities and won the only gold medal.

A meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the important skill certificates I have besides my driver's license!
Spread the word: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As is well known, there is actually a period of time before the ambulance arrives after an accident, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time when first aid is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, and respiratory arrest, then we only have four minutes of life window, the golden four minutes!
Therefore, how important it is to have people around you who know first aid!
When someone falls down beside us, we can rescue him through professional knowledge instead of standing there stupidly and doing nothing, which is a terrible feeling of helplessness.
In China, official data shows that there are three million accidental deaths every year, the most dangerous of which is cardiac arrest.
Across the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, 78% can be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing are below 1%.
This is what the founding member of First Reaction, Lu Le, said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, no breathing, no heartbeat, squeezing their chest is of no use.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions are the only way to save a person.
I find that there are still few people who have the awareness to learn first aid, but when things happen, it's too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time when faced with emergencies.
Who knows, it might even save a person's life!
You can sign up for first aid certification at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are student discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals to be achieved before the age of 25, adding the first aid certificate to the goal list was also a few months ago, but it was indeed completed!
Then I'm going to take other certificates I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that I need a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
The shrimp dumplings for 13 yuan, just one!?
Never tried
How come #NAME# doesn't make it clear?
One for 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# delivered only one shrimp dumpling for me to eat!?
Because I clearly saw that the code was valid when I entered it before.
To start with the conclusion, I personally think that "Four Seas" is an all-round bad movie, in all senses of the word.
But if you say that this movie is not a highlight, then at least the music selection is quite good.
There are many kinds of bad movies, one that can make you fall asleep in the cinema, one that can make you angry after watching it, "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Emei Mountain for the audience, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is truly gifted.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it seems to be a creature from a clique novel, indescribable, full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Little Ma's body.
Even after watching it, you may suspect that there are metaphors implied by the director, but when you think carefully, you find that it is actually a pile of crap.
First, let me briefly explain some of the plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, relying on his grandmother for life.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, so the plot arranged for an old man in the neighborhood to take her to the northeast in a small van to see the snow.
An elderly person taking a minibus from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his dad are very reassured about this.
And then the old man was never heard from again.
How did the female protagonist and her brother get the business license to open a hotel on the abandoned ship?
How can the small hoodlums on the island easily block a mountain road with their flying cars?
Then the truck delivering the steel bars stopped by the side of the road, and the truck drivers around could not be found.
The prop's feelings are too obvious.
Why would a small-time hoodlum with a bad credit record and criminal suspicion become a police auxiliary?
Why didn't they report the usury to the police in the movie, and the police even asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door at a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to not find the hotel owner and sleeps outside the room door for a night?
This inexplicable plot is filled throughout the entire movie, and it is so far-fetched that I feel pain when I recall it.
Worse than the plot, the movie's theme, or lack thereof, is simply an abominable patchwork of disparate elements.
At the beginning of the movie, you would think he wanted to make a comedy, more than 20 minutes later you guess it might be a motivational film, halfway through you feel it might be a story about how hard it is for small town youth to survive, after watching it you don't even know what you just watched, followed by a deep doubt of yourself, why did you go to the cinema to enjoy the crap during the New Year.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the plot of various movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcyclist, then it would be a combination of inspirational and comedy, and then tell the audience how a talented rookie gradually succeeds.
If you want to make a romantic movie, then you should honestly tell the story of the love-hate entanglement between a small town youth who likes to ride motorcycles and a waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot contain anything contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that Yin Zheng played was just burned, and then the character who could still sing), you can't go to open some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't bear to watch.
As for the female protagonist, who is obviously not mentally handicapped but behaves like a 5-year-old in some aspects, I really don't know if it's due to her acting or the director's requirement.
I also don't quite understand why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this kind of movie arrangement in the Spring Festival file just to add trouble to the audience?

Chongqing Vocational School is piloting the modern apprenticeship system, where admission is equivalent to being a qualified employee of the enterprise - Xinhua News Agency.
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "Modern Apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 vocational schools. Students accepted for pilot training will also have the status of apprentices, and after enrollment, they will be pre-recorded by pilot enterprises as unit employees.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, and the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and quasi-employees of enterprises be clarified. According to the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and enterprises sign a three-party agreement. For apprentices who are 16 years old but not yet 18 years old, a four-party agreement must be signed by the apprentice, guardian, school and enterprise to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific post, teaching content and rights protection of the apprentice on the job.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms and cooperate with enterprises to carry out pre-job training and transfer training for employees.
Pilot schools should reform the talent cultivation model.
The school and enterprise jointly design a talent training program, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot takes the cultivation of the educational system as a pilot cycle. The internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent cultivation program, and the top post internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team-based management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students master the skills required for each rotation post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city determined 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches, with each pilot project having about 50 people and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) trained.
In accordance with the principle of first piloting and then implementing, exploring and establishing a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education between schools and enterprises, so as to effectively improve students' job skills, and enhance the employment rate and quality of students.

South African doctors: Although Omecamtiv mecarbil has strong transmission power, most cases are mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the new coronavirus variant, Omikron, are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omikron variant spreads in South Africa, a medical organization of more than 5,000 doctors in the province of Gauteng reported that the symptoms of the coronavirus patients they are currently treating are mild, such as body aches and coughs similar to those of the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized yet.
Pilai said, "They can control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said this includes elderly patients and those with health issues, who are more prone to severe cases of coronavirus infection.
He said that compared to the previous wave of Delta outbreak, the COVID-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels."
"Many people will be hospitalized within a few days."
Within two weeks of the first reported Omicron variant strain in Southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take a few weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Communicable Diseases, only 30% of the recent hospitalized COVID-19 patients have severe symptoms, which is half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave; the average hospital stay has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent COVID-19 patients have died, while the mortality rate of the early outbreak in South Africa was as high as 20%.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Research Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, said: "At present, almost all indications suggest that this is a milder disease."
He also said: "It's still early, we need to get the later data."
Generally, hospitalization and death occur later, and we only had two weeks to enter this wave of the epidemic.
At the same time, scientists around the world are monitoring case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Despite Deltha still being the main strain of the coronavirus worldwide, cases of Omikron are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in the first week of December in Haoden Province increased by 400%, and tests showed that cases of the Omikron variant accounted for more than 90%.
Thank you to all the supporters today, 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education Times Commentary: What Can Save Abducted Children?
If we use the famous public welfare advertisement "No trade, no killing" as an analogy, then in a good environment without the demand for "kidnapping", group prevention and control, and the whole people against kidnapping, make the kidnapping behavior unprofitable, risky and costly, such crimes will not occur again and again.
Recently, the Children's Missing Information Emergency Release Platform developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has been launched.
This is an Internet information platform established to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children's information and to promptly recover abducted children.
Upon hearing the name of this app is "Reunion", I feel a warm sense of comfort.
The new technology means not only has a name of "literature and art" full of feelings, but also the information utilization is proper, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-trafficking law enforcement is to locate and recover trafficked children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
Next is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment can be listed many "big words" from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
But before the trafficking case is cracked, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
Weighing the importance and urgency of the matter, under the urgent purpose of "rescue", topics such as "whether child trafficking should be punished by death penalty" which are controversial and have many opinions can be put aside for now and discussed cautiously; but the matter of rescuing trafficked children cannot be delayed.
According to the investigation experience of this type of case, traffickers are used to leaving the crime scene as soon as they succeed.
A delay of one minute in the anti-trafficking operation could mean a further step away from the parents for the child, and an increase in the difficulty of cracking the case.
In this situation, taking out effective measures such as the "Reunion" platform, which directly helps to solve cases and find children, is indeed a practical action.
After all, "fighting abduction" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
To combat crime, protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement of the law, all need to implement the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
In addition, prevention of child trafficking can be done better from families to society.
For example, a common case, a family of three resting at the train station, the parents fell asleep and woke up to find the child missing.
It is not reasonable to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, they should at least have a certain level of protection awareness.
Both parents taking turns to rest and placing the child under safe protection are the minimum measures to prevent child abduction.
From another perspective of the police's crackdown on trafficking crimes, the buyers of trafficked children should also be paid attention to and punished.
A single act of wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory penalty for the crime of child trafficking is 5 years; for those with particularly serious circumstances, the death penalty may be imposed and property confiscated.
With the trend of "leniency" in sentencing, the crime of child trafficking obviously belongs to a more serious crime with a high starting point and a maximum penalty.
Even today, there are still many cases of human trafficking occurring every year.
It can be seen that some people have outdated ideas about raising children and a weak sense of legal awareness.
Legal education for this group of people should be kept up to date.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, it cannot rely solely on official strict enforcement.
If the "market" of human trafficking is widely present, traffickers will be driven by their greed and constantly innovate their means of trafficking, forming a "struggle of law" situation with law enforcement, and the anti-trafficking action will inevitably fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, eradicating backward ideas and popularizing legal knowledge can also help to combat the crime of trafficking and buying children.

Yang Haodong combined his own insights and personal experiences from three aspects: ideal faith and original mission, self-revolution and youth party, party leadership and party theory, to explain the core essence and practical requirements of the spirit of the whole meeting in a comprehensive and systematic way.
He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the whole conference, the important speech and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping on Hunan, and the spirit of the provincial party congress to learn, integrate and understand, enhance the ideological, political and action awareness of "two establishment" and "two maintenance", and unswervingly move forward in the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
In the interactive exchange session, representatives of grassroots cadres, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of "two establishment", how cultural enterprises should grasp the orientation, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the hundred years of party history. Yang Haodong answered one by one in plain language and vivid examples. He earnestly exhorted young party members to draw strength from the hundred years of struggle history of the party, to unite closely around the Central Committee of the Party, to stay with the Party unswervingly, and to write responsibility and responsibility with youth dedication.

Actually, I don't know if it's the store's mistake or the rider's mistake.
There is no receipt on the bag.
Uninvestigable
I hope you understand
The delivery time was 30 minutes faster than indicated.
It's gone, thank you.
Yes, a new rider has been assigned.
He has been waiting for a long time.
That restaurant has always been said to be in the process of handling.
Waited for a few hours
The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two major categories, Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil (or Refined Olive Oil), with five levels.
First-pressed olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is a fat obtained by mechanically cold-pressing fresh olives and filtering out impurities.
It can be divided into three levels according to the different acidity.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity does not exceed 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: Taste and flavor are acceptable, acidity not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after the first-pressed olive oil with acidity exceeding 3.3% is refined, or known as "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Common Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is blended with a certain proportion of cold-pressed olive oil to balance the taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, transparent light golden yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil is an olive oil obtained by extracting and refining it from the residue through the dissolution method.
If you have seen the grade classification, you should have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
It should be known that olives, just like grapes used for making wine, come from different regions and different olive varieties, producing olive oil of different standards.
The best place for olive growth:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation for the growth of olives.
Apart from the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only grow sparsely in suitable areas.
Main production area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and similarly climatic countries such as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc. far south of the equator.
The harvesting month for olives:
From March to June every year is the time when olive trees bloom and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruits begin to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February of the following year is the season for fruit picking (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
The Democratic Summit concluded, with Biden proclaiming that the fire of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy" convened by US President Biden and attended by government, civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world concluded on Friday (December 10th).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of people all over the world and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also expressed that he plans to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Taiwan government representative and political affairs committee member Tang Fenghe and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, "We know how daunting the task before us is."
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge, as I have said before, as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere in the world.
"Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the spark of freedom; it burns in the hearts of people all over the world."
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires the collective effort of the entire society.
He said: "As government leaders, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability, and be better able to resist the buffer and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public interest."
The second day of the "Democratic Summit" focused on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and combating authoritarianism, as well as countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day".
In his opening remarks on the same day, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres also expressed that the cause of democracy is facing challenges globally, especially the challenges brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said, "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and positions, and the resilience of democracy."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong delivered a speech at the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding the participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of ethnic minorities in China, such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans in Hong Kong.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise, but no mechanism has been established to hold it accountable.
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must work together.
"We must use all that we have (resources) to ensure the revival of democracy is our top priority."
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you haven't realized the threat the (Chinese Communist Party) poses to our democratic values."
And this is the reason for our failure.
"This is also the reason we must change."
At the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Autocracy and Affirming Democratic Values", Taiwan Executive Yuan's Administrative Deputy Minister Tang Feng delivered a video statement of the "National Declaration", emphasizing Taiwan's position at the forefront of the fight against autocracy and tyranny.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At the dawn of democracy in Taiwan, we have always stood firmly on the front line of the global fight against authoritarianism, and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have justified the infringement of human rights in the name of public health and collective interests, indicating a global retreat of democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to lock down the city to control the epidemic, nor do we have to take down fake news to win.
On the second day of the "Democratic Summit", the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from countries such as China and North Korea that were identified as serious human rights violators, and also imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company identified as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I have taken the photo and uploaded it to you.
I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why it keeps delaying the delivery time.
Originally #NUMBER#
Anyway, I'm not calling.
I'm not eating anymore.
I will definitely make a complaint.
Why didn't you tell me earlier if you can't deliver it?
Waiting for you for so long
No, I didn't receive the call.
Please notify him to deliver to our company again.
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes anymore.
We waited for a meal for half an hour.
#PRS_ORG# has not been delivered yet.
I want to cancel the order.
Why not cancel it?
Hi, the salivating chicken delivered by the restaurant is raw.
I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often directly proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't distinguish, then the expensive ones are usually more friendly than the cheap ones. This kind of "entry-level clap" is actually industrial waste.
They have low intensity, when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't hold up, and it's difficult for experts to control.
The underlying logic and subtext of their existence is - tennis is so hard, they know you can't learn it, they also know you don't want to buy expensive ones, so they make a cheap one to fool you, you play it twice and you won't play it again, so the racket is cheap and you don't feel bad.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means you have made progress. Come to me to buy the expensive ones then, and I will make money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar amount of money to buy a slightly better second-hand racket. Choose Prince or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so good rackets are not expensive. A new one for 500 or 600 is good enough, and a second-hand one for 200. Isn't it enjoyable to have a thousand-dollar racket?
It is friendly to newbies, but it is useless after the novice stage, but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the novice stage.
The order has been delayed multiple times for delivery.
Could you please help me follow up on this?
Postpone
Thank you
So, I already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order next? Do I need to ignore the previous one?
Hi, I ordered food from this restaurant, but many items were missing and the saliva chicken was raw.
#PRS_ORG# said I should take it for no reason, please cancel it.
My order is for delivery, there is absolutely no option for self-pickup.

Actually, there are many considerations for girls with slightly overweight bodies when it comes to dressing.
Girls with a bigger body should not wear skirts that are too short or too long; the length should be around the knees, just enough to cover the fat part of the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, it will reveal the fat on the legs.
If it's too long, it will give people a short and fat feeling.
If you divide your outfit into three parts, top, skirt and long socks, with different colors, it will give you a natural height increase and a sense of elongation.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for slightly plump girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat, and elegant black skirts are the first choice for slightly plump girls.
Wearing dark colors, especially a black mini skirt, will make you look slimmer.
If your calves are chubby, don't wear socks and shoes that draw too much attention.
The more popular it is, the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
To avoid people paying attention to your legs and feet and giving the impression of being overweight.
For slightly chubby girls, it is important to know the tricks of dressing well.
Plump girls should never wear tight mini skirts, and the tops should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, which will make people uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, wear black long socks or mesh socks (the kind with fine grids). Choose a soft printed trumpet skirt and match it with a drape neck top to cover up the shortcomings of the plump girl.
Of course, there are also standards for girls with a little bit of extra weight when it comes to wearing short skirts.
A fat girl should choose a top that matches the color of her short skirt, which will make her plump figure look taller.
A short skirt paired with high heels can make your legs look more slender, which is the most IN pairing for summer!
If you are a MM with a fat upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous dress.
Not only can it cover your big belly, but it can also show off your best features.
An A-line skirt will be slimming, especially for chubby girls. Choose a tighter top to create a layered look for a slimmer effect.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt, even chubby MM can try it.
Even a slightly chubby girl can wear fashionable clothes.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing, even slightly plump girls will be the focus of everyone's attention.
After making changes in clothing matching, exercise more in life and strive to get rid of the label of slightly fat girl earlier 😄

The girl acted as a target for her sister's fundraising: "It's still okay to think of it as a flesh wound" - Xinhua News
A girl stands in front of a large wooden board at Wulin Square in Hangzhou, with the words "Human Target, 10 Yuan per Arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl willing to be a 'target' to raise donations for her sister" went viral on social media.
Photos show that a girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stands in front of a slightly higher wooden board, which reads "Human Target, Ten Yuan per Arrow", indicating that passers-by can use bows and arrows after payment.
The behavior has sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xiaocheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the New Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl made such an extreme move for her sister's fundraising, but such behavior is not worth advocating. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
The girl on the street was warned for soliciting donations for her "arrow target"
In the circulated pictures, a long-haired girl stands in the shape of a "person" in front of a large wooden board. The board is written with "human target, ten yuan per arrow" in black ink. Another board in front of her is written with her bank account, WeChat, Alipay account, etc.
The picture caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens think that this is a "begging for attention" behavior, and many netizens sympathize with it.
"We discovered the situation when we patrolled around the square at around 10 o'clock in the morning on the 23rd. At that time, there were already many onlookers."
When the police officers from the Tianshui Police Station near the incident site were interviewed by the local media, they said that there were two girls selling goods, both around 20 years old, dressed in youthful and beautiful clothes.
Among them, the girl who was the "human target" was crying, asking passers-by to play the game; another girl was shouting on the side, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and now urgently needed surgery fees, please help.
"We have contacted the local police in Guizhou and found out that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xiaocheng branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the New Beijing News reporter that the girl's name is Jijiali and she is raising donations for her elder sister Jijiayan.
But due to the need for more than 300,000 in treatment costs, unable to think of a good way to raise funds, this behavior was made.
He said that during the whole process, two girls, one as a target and one as a shooter, were involved, but no one was shooting arrows. Only some people were watching and taking pictures, which were posted on Weibo.
After the police investigation, the bow and arrow used did not fall within the scope of control.
The responsible person stated, "We do not advocate taking this kind of eye-catching fundraising approach."
After being warned by the police officers at the police station, she has left the police station.
Heat dissipation: Good Thinness: Convenient Appearance material: Satisfactory Acer has always had a high cost performance.
The new machine is very good.
Stable performance, four exhaust outlets for cooling without any problems, worth recommending.
This Acer Shadow Knight Dragon gaming laptop is pretty good, with good workmanship and materials, and a reliable brand!
The price of Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is still not expensive.
Personally, I think the Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is really good. Game performance: The game performance is refreshing, and most games can be played smoothly. My chicken eating is all high frame rate and very smooth. LOL is not to be mentioned. CSGO is also easily handled. Most AAA games can be played.
Heat dissipation effect: The heat dissipation effect is good, the fan is powerful, the work is quite quiet, and the game effect is still not small when the fan is fully open.
Appearance material: Cool and cool appearance, the game's own cool display effect: The screen is clear, playing games 1080 is enough.
Buying a laptop feels really good, mainly for design, high cost performance, lighter than expected, and better looking than expected. The red on the butt is a very nice wine color, not so garish, overall much higher than expected, worth buying, girls are also very suitable.
I started using Acer Nitro Knight two years ago and it has been a great value for money with excellent quality!
I also recommend my friends around me to buy this product!
We have already purchased three machines in this series!
It has a nice look and is well-configured.
I wanted to wait for the 418 bank activity to buy something for my nephew, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance and missed the big bank activity, which is a bit regretful.
However, the cost-performance ratio is quite high, the logistics is also quite fast, let's come back to review after a period of time.
A brand new original, high cost-performance game laptop, with a good design style, already installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
Display effect: Bought a child to do 3D rendering, the software has been installed, the child said it can be used without any problem, this computer can do 3D design work performance.
He said it was great that I bought it for my son.
The computer is very good, especially the customer service attitude is very good, don't understand just ask, recommend to buy.
Not bad, the graphics of the game are really good.
What is the hottest in 2021?
There is no doubt that it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, an article titled "Look! Project Managers Can Compete for Gold Medals in Olympic Projects" was very popular. It mentioned that in many projects, project managers can definitely take the lead and no one can match them: carrying bricks, business trips, and staying up late are the daily routines of project managers, and putting out fires, taking responsibility, and apologizing are even more common.
Although it appears to be a joke, this article also reveals the daily hardships of project managers, representing the current lack of enthusiasm for project management work.
Meanwhile, personnel engaged in project management are gradually choosing to take action to get themselves out of work-related predicaments.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (Project Management Professional certification) registrations every year, more and more project management practitioners are enhancing their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the "China Project Management Twenty Years Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified people was about 420,000, and the number of valid certificate holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certified people has been increasing year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer feasible to simply copy the "old experience" of the past. The ever-changing working environment tells us that we need to learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, does passing the PMP guarantee smooth project management work?
Many project management beginners indicate that by learning related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the ten major fields and five process groups of project management and related knowledge points, but when it comes to actually doing project management work, they are still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: inadequate project management cognition, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theory but not knowing how to practice it; lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to implement in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control and sensitivity, and the project dragging on and on; unclear member division, "old hands" in the team not knowing how to respond, cross-departmental assistance and communication not smooth, and the project difficult to advance...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other R&D key talents, and has won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base". It brings the online course of "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp".
"R&D Project Manager Training Camp" Online Course This is a way of online fragmented learning, combining many practical cases, tools and methods of R&D-type enterprises, to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and embark on the advanced path of project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower costs and less investment, and bring efficient operational results to the enterprise.
Words are not enough, let's take a look at what other students say about this course: This course is not only taught by the Zhongtianhua Xia expert team (formerly Huawei R&D management team), but also combines international advanced project management methodology and many well-known enterprise real business scenarios to give a professional and in-depth explanation of the course content.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms, to help students transform the learning content into specific work after class.

(hereinafter referred to as "Jiexin") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in terms of financial consumption, but there are still large differences in terms of financial behavior and skills, and further efforts are needed to improve the basic financial knowledge level.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and the youth is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will still be the focus of continuous financial education; Nielsen's "China Young People's Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way of consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, which is contrary to the "excessive extravagance" label attached by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behaviors, which have caused excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to an increase in social problems. Financial enterprises should take the initiative to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jiexin has always been committed to helping the people build their own happy life with high-quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to the call of supervision, to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, with practical actions.
In the past few years, CSC Credit has been carrying out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, and has subtly guided the consumption needs of young people through various forms such as cooperation with top domestic universities and launching innovative practice competitions, helping them to establish a rational consumption concept, plan their consumption needs reasonably, and thus help them accumulate wealth for life.
On the occasion of Double Twelve, Jiexin reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and a correct money view, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid the misunderstanding of consumption and loan, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, it is necessary to plan ahead and pay back on time according to one's ability.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on economic life such as car purchase and house purchase in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications for operation.
In the future, Jiexin will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated and iterated financial products to bring consumers more demand-oriented and diversified services, continuously help the public to improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and be a consumer finance partner that consumers can rely on for life.

Vietnam People's Network - Gulf Cooperation Council Responding to Common Challenges
The stops of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's tour include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to Qatar since the Gulf diplomatic crisis, which was triggered by the embargo imposed by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies on Qatar in mid-2017.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, imposed a full embargo on it, accused Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations, and having close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tension has seriously affected the internal unity of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading efforts to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in both countries.
The Gulf Arab states resolving differences to restore relations with Qatar is driven by the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, in order to address common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf countries.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens and the integration of supply chains.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' businesses have signed 13 Memorandums of Understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with Iran's negotiations with major world powers to save the Iran nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan (JCPOA), which the Gulf Arab states condemned as unable to solve the Iranian missile issue.
The Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a "competitor" and its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is flawed to not address the Iranian missile issue and take action to contain Iran's activities in the region.
Against the backdrop of the major powers' nuclear negotiations with Iran failing to meet the desires of the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct negotiations.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council states.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate its diplomatic achievements in contributing to the restoration of the GCC unity and to propose measures for its member states to fully cooperate in order to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Good
It is said to be the loudest supercar exhaust sound in New Mountain District!
This car that our team has brought to you is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor of Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgit, the annual road tax is more than ten thousand ringgit, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Can you imagine how fast it is with 700 horsepower?
I don't know either. Data says it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h. That means when myvi just reaches 30km/h, it has already reached 100km/h. Hmm.
The low-slung body, the arrogant scissor doors, the huge air intakes around the body, and the 6.5 V12 engine visible through the glass perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
No need to say too much about the car model, just Google it and the editor has compiled some explanations that may not be available on Google!
Too much attention, wherever I go everyone is watching, very uncomfortable! (Actually kind of cool)
The cost of 1km is around RM1 (the car owner doesn't care at all).
Practice the getting on and off the train posture, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you can't climb out of the cabin and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise is too loud, and you will be deaf after getting off (but it's still cool).
The body of the car is too big, and it will be very narrow when parked in a normal parking space, I'm afraid it will be knocked when the car next door opens the door!
It's a bit lonely because there's no one to compete with on the road. (This is something I said myself, not related to the car owner, haha)
Please don't misunderstand, this supercar video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos for your beloved car, welcome to contact us!
More car information that you don't know about, is at The Car Guide / People's Car Guide.
Involved in a car accident worth millions!
Both Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are well-known to car enthusiasts. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
Just a few minutes before that day, a million dollar Porsche 911 and a ten million dollar Bugatti Chiron were crashed overseas!
Looking at the results, it makes sense to be expensive!
Resonate the spirit of the university with the spirit of the times-Xinhua Net
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational ideas and value pursuits that have been accumulated in the development process of a university for a long time, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university is of utmost importance for the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, and society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, which arose in the national crisis, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "cultivating morality to benefit the world and governing the country with propriety" and the patriotism of "promoting learning to strengthen the country".
At present, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming more and more obvious. The global competition in education, science and technology, and talents is intensifying. Higher education undertakes an important role as the "supply side", and its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
Especially the proposal of the Overall Plan for the Construction of World-Class Universities and Disciplines has not only demonstrated the confidence and determination of our country to move from a country of higher education to a strong country of higher education, but also put forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How to strive to join the ranks of the world's top-notch in a shorter period of time, and accelerate the establishment of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still having certain gaps, to achieve "overtaking on a bend"?
In addition to firm goal confidence, path confidence, and ability confidence, universities should also make full use of three advantages: first, the late-mover advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents, learning and drawing on the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, promoting and developing excellent traditional culture, to consolidate strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image; third, the system advantage, giving full play to the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening goal-driven, gathering consensus and joint efforts, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to accelerate catching up with the world's advanced level.
It is particularly important to be aware that it is impossible for all universities to be the same in building a world-class university. Each school must show its own personality and characteristics while playing to its strengths.
The characteristics of running a school should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect the unique target positioning, school tradition and resource endowment of each school.
As for Zhejiang University, we focus on three characteristics in our school-running: first, we emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated education environment of science and technology integration and school-enterprise integration, and form a whole chain entrepreneurial education ecology; second, we emphasize the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create a system environment of interdisciplinary convergence, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and iconic interdisciplinary achievements; third, we emphasize the characteristics of school-running system and social service, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a pan-Zhejiang production-learning-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always adhere to the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the common values of "Diligence, Cultivation, Clarity and Pragmatism" and the common expression system of "Incorporating Rivers and Seas, Opening up True and Noble Virtues, Pioneering the People and Building Our Country" constitute the latest expression system of the Zhejiang University spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of education, continuously accumulate cultural height, and condense spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching in significance.
Among them, "Hai Na Jiang He" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mentality of "using talents from all over the world", and expresses the quality concept of drawing on the world-famous universities for education; "Qi Zhen Hou De" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, referring to the university's pursuit of truth while also receiving the cultivation of virtue and tempering of character; "Kai Wu Qian Min" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of knowledge, research innovation, and reform and development, as well as breaking the old and establishing the new; "Shu Wo Bang Guo" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always share the same honor and disgrace with the nation's destiny.
This series of spiritual concepts and values pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year history of running a school.
"The wise listen to the soundless, the wise see the formless."
Chinese universities should further take root in the overall cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the era and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independent freedom, let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times, the spirit of the nation stimulate each other, so as to provide inexhaustible power for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

As NFTs quickly become popular, a new concept has emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who had lost job opportunities due to the pandemic began to gain stable income from this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, which integrates various gameplay including NFT, and is currently the highest trading volume NFT project, with a total of more than 3 billion US dollars so far.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity's daily revenue has exceeded 8.2 million US dollars, almost catching up with "King of Glory".
On August 6th of this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" brings a new "play-to-earn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer just single roles. In addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This kind of agency is not granted by the game producer, but is ensured by blockchain technology.
Upon seeing a news article about a friend's stock price, my biggest takeaway was the choice of industry for investment targets. Firstly, one should choose an industry with a large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion; secondly, one should choose an industry with good future growth potential, considering the industry's optimal growth state in 3-5 years; finally, one should choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market scale, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and the track being flat or rugged refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Cheer on the right track!
The first thing for the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
Tactics lies in "do the things right", which is to do things correctly.
The strategy lies in "do the right thing", that is, do the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding direction, tactics lies in implementation, and there is space for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
For example, in terms of increasing the number of customers (tactical thinking), one can think about whether to continue deepening in the current field or to expand horizontally in other fields (strategic thinking); in terms of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), one can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); in terms of increasing the participation rate of activities (tactical thinking), one can consider how to set the correct activity KPI to achieve the correct activity goal, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling in new customers; in terms of increasing DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin has welcomed several milestone events in 2021.

After seeing my wedding dress photo, I realized that I was also a "photo cheat".
Asian American groups have complained of discrimination in admissions at three Ivy League universities - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency Washington May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian American groups submitted appeals to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting the discrimination against Asian American applicants in the admissions process of the three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Coalition, which took the lead in initiating the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
At the press conference, the chairman of the group, Zhao Yu Kong, said that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of American famous universities has doubled, but in these three American famous universities, the proportion of Asians has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities have been "systematically and persistently discriminating against Asian-American applicants" in the so-called "holistic admissions" process.
Zhao Yu said that according to the research of Sanders and other scholars in 2014, among the three universities, the admission rate of Asian-Americans was the lowest relative to the number of applicants among all ethnicities.
Data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto racial quota for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yu told the Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope that after submitting the appeal, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice can launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans in admissions after determining the facts.
They also expect the complained universities to take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies towards Asian Americans.
So far, the three universities complained about have not responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015, when it had complained about Harvard University's discriminatory admissions, but the US Department of Education was not accepted on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese American groups participating in this appeal, American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups are also included.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Zhouting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a real estate agency. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, after Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the factory purchase with the family of the house owner, Lin, he transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit through the bank on the same day.
Lin Mou signed as the payee on the "Factory Building Purchase Deposit Receipt", which stipulates that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory building, the deposit will be returned to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell the factory building, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice, and the two parties agree to sign the factory building purchase and sale contract within one week."
However, afterwards, the two sides were unable to reach a consensus on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and payment methods, resulting in the delay in signing the house purchase and sale contract.
Taking into account that the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
Mr. Lu was helpless and angry when he had already chosen the house, paid the deposit, and prepared the payment, but the seller refused to sell it at the last minute.
Therefore, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyue City People's Court.
After the court's trial, it was found that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract, and it could not be solely attributed to the defendant. It should be reasonably assumed that the negotiation failed, so the double return of the deposit should not be applied in this case, and the defendant does not need to bear the breach of contract liability of double return of the deposit.
After the first trial judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the second trial court upheld the original verdict.
Lawyers remind [us] to fulfill necessary due diligence obligations during the transaction process.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to exercise due diligence, such as verifying the information of the house owner, whether the house is occupied by others, and clearly specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
After the "Democratic Summit" ended on Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson issued a statement on Saturday (December 11th) saying that the US-hosted "Leaders' Democratic Summit" is "drawing ideological lines, weaponizing and instrumentalizing democracy, acting against democracy in the name of democracy, inciting division and confrontation, and diverting domestic conflicts".
The Chinese government believes that for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on others, carried out "democratic transformation", imposed unilateral sanctions, instigated "color revolutions", and caused disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'large-scale lethal weapon' for the US to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action for Biden to fulfill his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was conducted via video, with leaders from 111 countries invited to attend, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic issues, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of questioning both internationally and domestically in the United States, such as criticism of the invited leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, etc. Some people suspect that the real intention of the Biden government is not for democracy, but for geopolitical purposes to organize this summit.
Newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the video democratic summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said, "Today's American democracy is showing its pathology, with money politics, identity politics, party confrontation, political polarization, social fragmentation, racial conflicts, and wealth disparities becoming increasingly serious," and that American democracy is a "rich man's game" built on a capital base.
In his speech, US President Biden said, "As government leaders, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, drive reform, achieve transparent accountability, and be better able to resist the forces of authoritarian buffering and impact, as well as those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not taken for granted, "We must constantly renew it in each generation, in my view, this is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that "at a time when global democracy and human rights are facing sustained and worrying challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The US side has promised to launch a one-year action plan after the summit of democracy, including an initiative of 424.4 million US dollars to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support for independent media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the physical democracy summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all countries fulfill our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year."
Alright, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address.
RICHANG Restaurant (Wudaokou Branch)
Mint Environment: Standard Service: Quick service My must-order dish is "Traditional Mala Cake" - it's too fragrant, too soft and too delicious 😋 If you like desserts, you must try the "Dongjiang Cuttlefish Sliding Bean Curd Pot" - the soup is very fresh and the tofu is very tender. The cuttlefish...
Delicious taste, good meat, warm service.
It's been a long time since I came to Ritchang, the fruit lao is still so delicious & the ingredients are sufficient. The first time I ordered the char siu bao, it was the southern taste of the soft flour that I love!
The braised rice is just the right degree of dryness and the portion is very generous. The signature wax paper chicken wings are as good as ever, the soup is also good, and the kale is also well-handled.
Tasty, friendly service, good meat.
RICHANG Old Store has been a popular presence for many years, with its small building in Dongdan and wooden floor.
We always have to wait a long time at the entrance to get the claypot rice, and the claypot is cracked...
It has been several years since I last went to eat at Richeng. The rise of various small Cantonese restaurants has dispersed the customer flow.
It's rare to have a seat when you arrive at the store, and the quality of the dishes is as good as ever.
Tastes great, good meat, great staple food.
RICHANG Delivery.
The dishes for this meal were a bit disappointing.
Three cups of chicken: there is a bit too much side dish, and a bit too little chicken.
The main flavor of this dish is a bit off, the underlying salty taste is not enough, which highlights the sweetness. Everyone can imagine sweet + various spices and side dishes...
What is the Red Label Whiskey drinking method?
Everyone has different hobbies, some people like collecting, some people like food, and of course some people like wine tasting. Red Label Whisky is one of the most popular Scotch whiskies in the world, and it has won the gold medal in the International Spirits Competition.
Every bottle of Red Label whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, wouldn't it be a waste of its smoothness?
So how do you drink Red Label whisky?
The editor will give a brief introduction for everyone.
Red Label Whiskey Drinking Method:
Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is blended from about 35 Scotch whiskies, with a rich aroma and the traditional characteristics of Scotch whisky, with a sweet and smoky aroma in the rich aroma.
The entrance is rich and refreshing, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor.
This wine can be enjoyed on its own with ice or mixed with your favorite beverage.
Red Label Whiskey entered the domestic market, in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, Red Label Whiskey + Coke or Sprite or Schweppes and other carbonated drinks became a timeless fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to neutralizing the sourness, can bring visual pleasure to people. Adding them to drinks can dilute the taste of alcohol and change the taste.
Red Label Whiskey + Slice of Lemon + Rock Sugar (or regular sugar) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
Authentic Hongfang Weidao has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, lemon will bring a refreshing aroma to the wine, of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The above three are the best ways to drink Red Label whisky. Everyone can try them as a reference. I hope my introduction can help everyone.
Educational Thinking: How University Exams Can Benefit Both "Academic Elite" and "Academic Underachievers" - Xinhua News
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders, expressing their confusion about the university exams and proposing to increase the difficulty of the exams, change the type of questions, and make the exams truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, for a long time, university exams have been a "hot topic".
In the university campus, students come from all over the world, with different abilities and levels of learning, resulting in a wide variety of learning situations.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings when assessing such a diverse group.
Of course, if the exam questions are single-type and have a high repetition rate, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably create a completely different feeling.
Students who don't put in effort may be able to pass the exam with a last-minute cram session, but if they try other methods, they may be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, "slackers" can pass the exam without much effort and even get high scores; "nerds" never miss classes, have good homework and notes, and don't get much higher scores in exams, creating a "strange situation".
It appears that the Lanzhou Jiaotong University students' reflection on the problems in university exams is not without reason, and it is believed that this situation is not only present in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
From this level of meaning, we should give praise to the three students who wrote the letter directly.
In fact, people who have been to university are well aware that it is not uncommon for students to rush to prepare for exams, try various ways to "extract" exam questions from teachers, strive to get the scope of the exam, and get "key guidance" before the exam. Even during the exam, it is not uncommon to sneak in small copies and ask the teacher to raise his hand after the exam.
In my opinion, as a quality assessment of teaching, the qualification of a university exam depends more on the comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning by the teacher, and the scientific proposition on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate stage, the major begins to be subdivided, and many major courses are mainly based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content to be tested in a university exam.
As for undergraduate knowledge, it is basically composed of basic theories and common knowledge of the subject. In terms of knowledge points, the space for change is not large and is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics for university 20 years ago is still being studied and is still the focus."
However, the basic knowledge points remain unchanged, which does not mean that the exam questions are single and repeated.
In many universities, the examination is generally composed of a question-setting group, and then the senior teachers of the subject are coordinated to form the test paper. The examination marking is also participated by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so that the situation of repeated questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
But to draw up a set of test questions that meet the actual teaching and learning situation, the questions should be normally distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students, and the teaching situation should be comprehensively mastered, and the degree of students' learning should be comprehensively analyzed, so as to make the test proposition dynamically grasp the difficulty and type of questions, which can not only highlight the examination of basic knowledge, but also take into account the ability examination, and at the same time innovate the design of the type of questions.
Exams are the baton of university education. Depending on the type of exams, students will have corresponding preparation plans, which will eventually affect the effectiveness of university education.
For the student suggestion letter, Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
Require all teaching units to organize teachers to carry out research and course final examination comparison self-examination, formulate examination paper setting and related systems, at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper setting and review links, refine the score evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
It is an issue that university examination affairs need to face to solve the problem of single type of test questions and repeated questions from the mechanism. Of course, corresponding systems need to be introduced, but the effort lies in daily work. Teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the students' learning situation. With a comprehensive understanding of both teaching and learning, teachers and students will be better connected and form a positive interaction. The exam will be more in line with reality, so that both "scholars" and "dunces" can get what they deserve.
If you can't change the location of my store, can you change it to delivery?
Do I need to give more money then?
The colleague's order has been delivered.

Where is the GPS? Has it arrived yet?
Mrs. Kim's Wedding Photography (Nanjie Store) currently has no branches yet.
Before taking the photos, because we didn't arrange the time well, we changed the time twice, and the consultant Lan Lan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, we chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos.
The staff of Mrs. Kim, whether it be consultants, makeup artists, or photographers, are all amazing.
That was my first time doing formal makeup, wow~ I can't believe it, I can look so good one day, haha.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry I can't remember her name) were very patient with the makeup and it looked very natural.
The outdoor scene was shot in Jiangwan City, luckily the weather was good that day and we didn't feel cold. When taking pictures, the makeup artist would pay attention to our clothes and headgear from time to time, and if there was something wrong, they would immediately help us to fix it.
The photographer is also very humorous, and feels very happy after taking pictures all day.
When selecting photos, because I saw many cases online, I didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we selected the photos, there was really no intention to add more photos, directly 24 photos in the package, not even one was added (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos at the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to the 7,000 package, I was shocked at that time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many).
The photos were fixed today, Lan Lan sent them to me, I looked at them and found two of them not so good, they immediately helped me to fix them again.
I compared the photos my sister took before and I'm really satisfied with ours. It's simple and fresh, just the style I wanted.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Mrs. Jin's studio to take wedding photos!
Package price: 3999 yuan
Mrs. Jin is grateful to have you and sincerely wishes you happiness and a bright future!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah have no birth certificates due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper.
(Kota Kinabalu, 11th) Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper, birth certificates could not be issued to newborns since the beginning of October, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3200.
However, the director of the bureau, Kalu Amunus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have their information recorded in the system and will be issued with the anti-counterfeit paper when it arrives next week.
At the press conference, he explained the 10-month-long report of a web media pointing out the printing problem of Sabah newspaper.
He said that the issue had arisen two months ago, and Sarawak was facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeiting paper are affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in our country."
He explained that the security paper used by Sabah News was different from that used in other regions, so it was not possible to borrow inventory from other states.
Kalu Amunus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and will be handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and then return to Sabah to start the final stage of printing. It is estimated that it will take two more working days (December 20th) to deliver it to the applicant.
"We will notify applicants to go to the local branches to get the birth registration paper."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
Waiting from more than 7 o'clock until now.
Is it almost there?
I'm referring to food.
I'm waiting across from #PRS_ORG#.
Alright, thank you, the restaurant said it's ready.

Education Information: Beijing Compresses Ratio of Specialty Students Admitted to Junior High School in 2016 - Xinhua News
On the 21st and 22nd, the Beijing Municipal Middle School Admission Examination for Special Talents was organized and implemented by the District Education Commission.
This year, all districts of Beijing have compressed the proportion of enrollment for special talents, making the competition for special talents even more intense.
Taking Dongcheng District as an example, the proportion of primary school students entering junior high school as special students this year should not exceed 5% of the total enrollment plan in the district, with a planned enrollment of 380 people, and the proportion of students admitted should not exceed 10% of the school's enrollment plan.
All students with special talents in sports, art, and science who have registered online are eligible to participate in the special enrollment examination.
In order to facilitate students to participate in the examination nearby, Dongcheng District continues the examination arrangement of last year, setting 1-2 examination sites in each school district, a total of 13 examination sites.
The examination points are divided into examination rooms according to the examination area, and the examination period is divided by hour. The students will enter the examination points in different examination areas and take the examination according to the time period.
On May 23rd, the district education enrollment examination center announced the list of students who passed the examination online, and students can check the examination results online.

The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a document requiring strengthening epidemic prevention and control in port cities within 48 hours of a negative nucleic acid test and setting up a "buffer zone".
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng): The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring personnel leaving the land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) within 48 hours to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate, and personnel arriving at the land border port cities must undergo at least one nucleic acid test.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port cities in each province, region and city to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that qualified port cities may study the setting up of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
According to the relevant personnel of the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and the two sides of the border are frequently exchanged.
Implement differentiated management policies in different regions, change from one line of defense to two lines of defense, and move the checkpoint forward, compress the risk of epidemic spread, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the least social impact and the lowest social cost.
In recent times, there have been multiple local cluster outbreaks in our country, all of which were imported through port cities from overseas.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as inadequate timely local epidemic monitoring and early warning, inadequate implementation of closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, formal nucleic acid testing, inadequate disinfection of cold chain items in each link, inadequate management of centralized isolation sites, and inadequate scientific and precise emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires efforts to be made in nine aspects, such as perfecting the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, establishing a sound epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to quickly make up for the weak links in the prevention and control of port cities, and to do the prevention and control work without relaxation, scientifically and accurately, and to weave a tight line of defense against imported cases.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood security, publicize and facilitate the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly check the potential risks of basic living materials supply and prices, and timely solve and proactively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include counties (cities, districts, banners) where open land, water and air ports are located, cities (prefectures, states, leagues) where they are located, and directly-administered cities, and the specific scope shall be determined and announced in a timely manner by each province (autonomous region, directly-administered city) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

Oil Tube Video Uncovers the Truth of US Military's Bloodthirsty Slaughter for 20 Years - Xinhua News
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the US launching the Afghanistan War in the name of "anti-terrorism" and forcibly exporting American democracy. For 20 years, they have been fighting fiercely, bloodthirsty, and killing innocents, committing various crimes against humanity.
Misusing drones to bomb civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distorting human nature, and forming killing squads.
For the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" to apply various cruel punishments and personal humiliation to "suspects".
Every act of inhumanity further fuels the hatred of the Afghan people.
As the video said, the American "anti-terrorism" war is "the more anti, the more terror".
War has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people, only a ravaged country and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video and let's uncover the truth of the US's bloody slaughter in the name of "anti-terrorism" and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I came across the following article, which discusses from a business and preservation perspective why this customer wants a logistics company in the bonded area to do canning, although canning belongs to deep processing and is not within the scope of the bonded logistics company's business. The following text may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I went to many factories of milk powder and got in touch with many production lines of milk powder.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged and tinned milk powder are exactly the same, without any difference.
So everyone will definitely ask: why is the shelf life of the bag one year, while the shelf life of the can is two years or longer?
Or ask why the price difference between bulk and bagged is so big?
In fact, many consumers, or mothers, think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
Actually, the raw materials are the same, it's just that people think expensive is good.
Some consumers even have this mentality that the taste or flavor of the packaged food is different after eating it!
Now I will first explain to everyone the reasons for the expensive hearing aids. Where is the expensive part?
Why is the price difference so big if their raw materials are the same?
Because when setting prices, most manufacturers take into account that if the bagged pricing is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturer are very low, or even no profits, then what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
Therefore, they have a large increase in the list price to protect their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers promote listening packaging rather than bag packaging.
Moreover, how do the manufacturers get the tens of millions or even billions of advertising fees every year that you are thinking about?
Everyone can imagine it.
So with the development of society, the cost of market promotion, such as shopping mall promotion personnel, shopping mall display costs, product gift costs, advertising costs, etc., are also increasing.
Therefore, manufacturers are constantly increasing new products, and they are listening to the installation, and the price is also constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product that comes with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to get higher profits, in fact, the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There is also a part of the brand, in order to promote their own products, unscrupulous means, with the hospital's doctors hook, by their assistance in the promotion of products, from a hearing ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan profits.
And the relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such operations and methods, in fact, this practice is to cheat consumers.
It is suggested that people buy bagged milk powder and put it in a can under the premise of having a can at home, which can save money and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder without any impact on the children.
Don't think that the shelf life of canned food is longer than that of bagged food. If the shelf life of canned food and bagged food is the same after opening, it just means that bagged food is not easy to store and is prone to moisture and deterioration.
The delivery was late, the food was cold, and after it was cold it was dry and hard, so it was impossible to eat.
And the soup was spilled out.
Cancel immediately, the things #PRS_ORG# sent must have gone cold.
I haven't taken it!

Don't scare people off the starting line - Xinhua News
When visiting a book market, one often feels the popularity of books on success.
Many of the success books of today promote the "best principle" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it", and then tell you what you need to do.
In other words, it has skipped the most important and fundamental step of "how to do it".
Therefore, these books all have a common characteristic - either do your best with all your might, or don't do anything at all; either 100 or 0; either climb Mount Tai or just stay in the same place.
This "best principle" is recognized as "absolutely correct" by everyone who sees it, but 99% of people will be scared off before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a "you must make a firm determination, start anew, and make a 180-degree change" path, which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
It is self-deception and playing the lute to a cow to shout "you need to change" in the ear of someone who is conservative, adheres to rules, and resists change.
Most people are timid in front of the word "transformation", reluctant to move forward and unable to make a firm decision; or they make a sudden impulse to make a "transformation" decision and bravely take the first step, but often the good times are not long, and they can't persist for a while and fail, making it difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross-talk "Starting from Tomorrow" is the most vivid expression of this classic "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people, making most people "sigh at the door".
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a way that can enable more ordinary people to take the road to relative success.
The core of the "Second Best Principle" lies in "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve great victories", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that is always better than standing still.
In short, it's always better to do something than nothing.
With the threshold drastically lowered, there is now a greater possibility for ordinary people to persist, and with persistence, the probability of success will also increase.
The path to success by following the "second-best principle" is just a bit longer.
In short, the "best principle" may appear to be a banner for everyone's success, but in reality, it only motivates a few; while the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many as possible.

The Qinghai Lake naked carp resource reserve has increased by 71,000 tons this year - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) According to the latest monitoring results from the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, the resource reserve of Qinghai Lake naked carp has increased by 7,100 tons this year compared to last year, reaching 108,500 tons, which is more than 40 times the initial protection in 2002.
The naked carp of Qinghai Lake, commonly known as "Kunyu", is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biological diversity in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as massive hunting and the degradation of the environment in the spawning areas of the naked carp, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish farming, prohibiting any units, collectives and individuals from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial propagation and release, cleaning up the main tributaries of Qinghai Lake, designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage" and other measures, the Qinghai Lake naked carp resource reserve has increased year by year.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million artificially propagated and released naked carp have been implemented in Qinghai Lake, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Three Rivers Source Region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even in Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Region and Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued key water area fishing bans for the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake this year, constructing a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

The restaurant only gave me one bag, to put it in the bag, it's cold outside.
Can I ask if the takeout is packed in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
I want to know if it was missed or taken away by someone, thanks.
It's been an hour and it still hasn't been delivered.
I just saw an article about taking a vacation, it was too long.
Give a science popularization to men who don't know.
Most girls will experience their first period between the ages of 13-15, and will experience menopause around the age of 50.
Under the premise of good health, it will come regularly once a month.
But it's not regular enough to predict accurately, with a tolerance of about a week, so you need to prepare in advance. Sometimes, if you're unlucky, it can come earlier than expected.
The length of time, amount of blood, and degree of pain vary from person to person; some people have it for three days, some for a week; some have a light flow, some have a heavy flow; some have no reaction, some are in so much pain they need to be taken away in an ambulance; pain can change over time, just because it wasn't painful before doesn't mean it won't be painful in the future.
Menstruation cannot be controlled, and it lasts for several days, 24 hours of bleeding from start to finish. The only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or sanitary cotton strips to absorb the blood and prevent it from flowing onto clothes and chairs.
Menstrual cramps are mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen as soon as the menstrual period begins can effectively relieve the pain of that month. Taking it after the cramps start won't be of much help.
Before menstruation, due to excessive uterine blood and prostaglandin release, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it's around the period, if you have an inexplicable stomachache, your period will usually come within two days.
It is best to change sanitary pads every two to three hours, otherwise bacteria can easily breed. Excluding sleep time, the worst case is to change it 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces. If you add the prepared ones, it may be 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
The sanitary cotton swab does not need to be changed often, about every five or six hours, and at most eight hours.
Hormonal changes during the menstrual period may make one more irritable, and the ovulation period may also cause emotional instability due to hormonal changes, which is really unfortunate, as the body trips itself up.
However, official crime rate data shows that women still have a high ability to control their emotions and will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
Flowing is not just blood, it contains shed endometrium.
After the end of menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then it gradually thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house, building a house (endometrial thickening) every month to welcome guests, but the guests did not come, all dismantled (menstrual discharge) and build a new house next month, repeating the cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, a few days of 24-hour bleeding every month, and abdominal and back pain, who would want it?
But people can be born because their mother had menstruation, which is to prepare a house for you to stay for 10 months when you first come to this world, everyone should thank their mother for having regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things of women were suppressed, and society brainwashed them that it was dirty, shameful, and everyone thought it was like that, but times have changed.
If someone finds menstruation disgusting and finds the preparation of a female body for the purpose of bearing life disgusting, they should not say it in public. Girls, stand up and don't think like that anymore. Men who have never experienced it and will never experience it in this lifetime and don't understand it very well, don't be so ungrateful and don't be so shameless. How can they face their own mother with this attitude and how can they think of having their own children?
Finally, sisters, try the sanitary cotton swabs, they're really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice Festival, sending the wrong thing is quite disappointing.
Order an extra meal for the kids.
Hope the store will check the output even in the midst of a hundred busy tasks.
Is the foot bath basin numbness caused by electric leakage?
Choosing the right foot bathtub can have a good therapeutic and health care effect. Today, Gome's small editor will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot baths are increasingly loved by consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market, ranging from one hundred yuan to thousands of yuan. Foot baths are dazzling, giving consumers a lot of choice space.
According to the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, health care appliances such as foot baths are selling well, but there is no special industry standard for foot baths, so there are certain safety risks.
"It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday gift, but his father felt numbness in his feet when he was soaking his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt tingling in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen and it lit up unexpectedly. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was still good, although the foot bath was returned, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that there was no clear and detailed industry regulation on the long-standing foot bath basin in terms of the highest temperature setting, which type of people it is suitable for, and what materials guarantee safety.
Generally, there is no electrical problem with the foot bathtub, but there is no guarantee that some products have not been strictly checked before leaving the factory.
Therefore, when purchasing, choose a detachable foot bath basin.
Separating water and electricity poses no safety risks.
At the same time, you can take an electric pen to test.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily December 10th news (All media reporters Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, Correspondent Liu Xiaoling, Photography Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, displaying the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of 100 billion tea industry.
Hou Shunli, Deputy Director of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hong, Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
At the opening ceremony, Academician Liu Zhonghua, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced: The source of Lake Hong is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea injects new momentum into "Five-Colored Xiang Tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion Xiang tea industry, and formed the development pattern of "Three Xiang, Four Waters and Five Colors Tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, red tea and other main tea categories taking turns to strengthen their efforts. The main tea producing areas are promoting the integration of tea tourism, driving the income of the majority of tea farmers.
The wind and water turn in turn, and red tea is gaining strength again.
Tea experts in the province said that after picking green tea, red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round and the output value of tea gardens is rising in a straight line.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xinhua applauded the "source of Hunan Red".
At the Newhua Red Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants selected a high mountain tea called "Bingli Chun" and immediately placed an order.
Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Association Wang Zhun said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea expo, there are many bright spots.
New Red Tea adds a touch of red, infusing the connotation of tea culture, with strong popularity and hot transactions, the Xiang Tea industry welcomes a new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?
I don't want it, as there is no place to park below, he was unable to deliver it.
Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception, through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "Metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "The above is called Tao, the below is called instrument" in the "Book of Changes • Transmission of the Upper Classics", translated by Japanese Inoue Tetsujirō (Meiji era).
Metaphysics branches include ontology, natural theology and its related issues.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real existing entities and which nouns represent only a concept".
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis holds that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to a research method that does not make any assumptions about God.
Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the physical body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought discussing the relationship between the mind and the body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that investigates the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline that systematically thinks and researches human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the behavioral norms recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into metaethics (abstractly studying the nature of ethical theories or criticism) and normative ethics (evaluating various moral views and giving moral rule recommendations for right or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of moral behavior norms people should abide by, applies ethics (the academic of applying ethical theories to actual life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and summarizing from observed patterns).
It does not start from the expected theory for the examination of ethics, but rather investigates the real moral agent's actual choices that have been observed and all the moral factors that have led to this decision, and it studies the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, as well as medieval Christian ethics.
Part One: Humanistic Ethical Thought, represented by such people as Valla and Montaigne.
Part Two: Ethical thought of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
Part Three: Political Ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, Modern Ethics (17-18th century, British Empirical Ethics, representative figures: Hume, etc., 17-18th century, Continental Rationalist Ethics, representative figures: Spinoza, etc., 18th century, French Enlightenment Ethics, representative figures: Voltaire, etc., 18-19th century, German Academy Ethics, representative figures: Kant and Hegel, etc., 18-19th century, British Utilitarian Ethics, representative figures: Bentham and Sidgwick, etc., 19th century, British Evolutionary Ethics, representative figures: Spencer and Huxley, etc., late 19th century, German Neo-Kantian Ethics, representative figures: Li Kaer, etc., late 19th century, Neo-Hegelian Ethics, representative figures: Thomas Hill Green, etc.), Transition Period Ethics (Irrationalist Ethics, representative figures: Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, etc.).

I only spent so much money on takeout because I didn't want to go downstairs to buy something.
Ding Zilin: To My Friends.
I sincerely thank all my friends for their humanitarian assistance over the past 30 years since the death of our relatives, especially since I issued a humanitarian appeal in my own name to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, and the assistance has not stopped since then.
Nowadays, the majority of the victims' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started their own families and jobs.
It was your noble deed that helped us families in distress to get through the most difficult moments.
Currently, the novel coronavirus pandemic is ravaging the world, and most donors have already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you cease the humanitarian donations to the Tiananmen Mothers group, a difficult-to-reach group, as this humanitarian relief activity should have been concluded long ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your deeds will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me, friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Ye: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian aid provided by the Inter-Federation of Chinese Student Societies (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of engaging in humanitarian aid, the All-American Student Union and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations, and the project executors often overlap.

Relief funds often cannot be delivered smoothly to the hands of the Tiananmen Square victims.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established by "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June Fourth Orphan Education Fund", and after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all June Fourth orphans graduated from university, MCDF then established the "June Fourth Poor Elderly and Special Difficult Household Relief Fund" and has been implementing it to this day.
The funding for these projects mainly comes from donations from campuses and society in the year of 1989, generous donations from individuals, and support from the Democracy Foundation of Brother Universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, after a gap of 31 years, the June Fourth victims finally received part of the donations raised in Hong Kong in the name of June Fourth.
During this period, China Rights also independently implemented its humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding called for a stop to the June 4th donations out of consideration for the donors, who are mostly retired elderly people with incomes that are not as abundant as before retirement. We hereby express our gratitude to Teacher Ding's "Letter to Friends".
We will respect the decision of the stakeholders and terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately if necessary.
We express our gratitude and respect to those generous and brave comrades who have been persistently donating humanitarian aid funds and taking risks for many years.

Thank you for the rabbit's comment. Originally I said that the ancient style was not suitable for the ancient style, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you for your recognition, Dan Dan. Your satisfaction can energize us to keep going. We will keep up the good work!
This photography studio is really great, I strongly recommend all the buddies to come here!
There is no fault to be found in the reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography, and post-production.

As for Teacher Tian Liang, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two kittens playing together.
We work in Beijing and the better photography studios in Beijing require you to line up half a year in advance. My colleague took some photos in Beijing and after seeing the finished product, I thought it was just so-so.
I specially looked for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
We are not good at managing our facial expressions, which is also the case for most people. Photographer Liang Ge will capture and record the wonderful moments of nature.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production designer, a well-rounded team.
We and the people around us all praised it without end when it came out.
I have already recommended my best friend to go, and she was just as delighted after seeing the negatives.
I hope such a studio won't be buried, more people can discover it, take out their own style instead of being monotonous.

The restaurant staff is calling me now.
A programming novice who wants to share their personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to learn by yourself, after all, the money spent on training is very much, and it takes 6 months to study.
But if you are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who have weak self-discipline. Training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, we need to look at the faculty strength of this institution. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, this training institution will not be meaningful. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong faculty strength.
Secondly, before making a choice, it is better to inquire about the training institution, and it is even better to inquire about the students from this institution, after all, only the students from the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses are good or not.
Hi, actually I don't know how to answer your question because you haven't given any introduction about your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with one's own situation.
For example, profession, age, language to be learned, even in which city, all these will be related to the industry you are studying or want to engage in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or a computer major who has graduated, then if you have enough time, I personally suggest self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but one is expensive to learn, and two, it takes a lot of time to invest, basically requiring concentrated training for 3-6 months.
But if it's the cases I mentioned, self-learning is very convenient. Now there are many free learning resources on the Internet, or you can go to Bilibili for many training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through brief introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with video for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but can afford to pay certain learning costs and time costs, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. This way, learning does not require too much effort, the teacher's explanation is also detailed, and there are people who answer questions specifically. In addition, it is also helpful in terms of learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal referral quotas, and recommend them to companies after learning, so that the subsequent job interview can save a lot of things.
Above are my views. As I don't know your situation, what I said before is only a brief introduction and not detailed. If you have other questions, you can contact me anytime for communication.
I said I would be there before 1 o'clock and I saw it on the App.
What is called
I haven't finished speaking yet, what are you doing?
I undertake all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance) wall-mounted stove, water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove, range hood, lighting installation, glass cleaning, professional sewing, and housekeeping services.
Thank those who silently give me likes, strive hard for life, life is tiring but we must continue.
Life will not disappoint those who work hard, follow me if you like it, thank those who silently give me likes.
Life is like this, others only see the result, and we have to go through the process alone. Facing life, we have no choice but to be strong and keep going. We can look back on the road, but we can't go back...
Cleaning is a job and a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of dedication.
Although we do the dirtiest work, we will clean every corner of the customer's house with the most serious attitude. Seeing the satisfied smile and thumbs up of the customer, all the fatigue is worth it, and there will be a return for the effort!
My daily work
Your request, my service.
Serve with care, clean with care, keep the beauty.
The details you care about, Fenggui Home Services help you achieve "clean" what I can, serve the family with love.
Keep every family clean, set up a family governance monument, serve in place, and clean up to the family.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although crystal lamps are gorgeous, if they are not cleaned for a long time, they will become dull and lose their luster. Only after cleaning can they radiate their brilliance. Life is also like this.
Success comes from doing with heart, and delicacy shapes delicacy. We are serious about sewing.
Give me a chance and I will definitely make you satisfied. Quality speaks for itself because professionalism is trustworthy. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It's hard to make a living in any industry right now!
But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, enough perseverance and enough effort, I will be a little better than others, at least better than just sitting and complaining!
A day's plan starts in the morning, all the good starts from the morning. I hope you start a new day with joy, luck, health and good luck. Keep a good mood all day. Good morning.
When we were young, happiness was something to possess and be happy about; when we grew up, happiness became a goal to reach and be happy about; when we matured, we realized that happiness was actually a state of mind, to be understood and be happy about.
Be the most authentic and kindest version of yourself, follow your heart and have no regrets in this life; life is a journey, walk your own path; life has two treasures: good health and good mood, live brightly until old!
Every stage of life will encounter different difficulties.
Many times, what binds you is not your ability, but the courage to face it actively.
Since it cannot be avoided, it is better to face it with composure.
The more you fear, the more you will be overwhelmed by difficulties; if you face the difficulties head-on, the problems will eventually be solved.
China and Saudi Arabia collaborate to host the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua News.
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporters Wang Haizhou, Hu Guan) The first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial - officially opened to the public on the 11th at the Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating.
This biennial exhibition is jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Tian Fei Yu, Director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, as Artistic Director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "Feeling the Stones to Cross the River", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi society and culture.
This biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings presenting six units: "Feeling the Stones to Cross the River", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Peripheral Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total exhibition items, including painting, installation art and performance art; 12 Chinese artists' works are also highly concerned, some of which use recycled materials in a novel way to create, such as Xu Bing's "The Endless Picture of Xishan Series" (2014), which reconstructs a classic landscape painting with discarded materials.
Daryl Yeo, CEO of the Biennial Foundation, expressed his hope that this Biennial could establish an international dialogue, allowing global audiences to have the opportunity to understand the culture industry and creative community of Saudi Arabia that is booming, and to strengthen mutual interaction.
Tanya Feifel said, "The goal of the Biennial is twofold: to enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in global conversations, and to allow Saudi audiences to engage with the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that during the opening period of the biennial, a series of lectures will be held, and opinion leaders from artists, curators and the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinating and Regulating the Management of Public Welfare Posts in Rural Areas - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency Kunming December 12th (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job of helping the employment of people out of poverty and consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued relevant policies to promote the revitalization of rural public welfare posts, to help promote the comprehensive revitalization of the countryside.
According to the relevant responsible person of the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Department, at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare posts to provide employment for rural difficult groups such as poverty alleviation labor force, which plays an important role in helping the poverty alleviation group to realize employment income increase, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of various public services in the countryside.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance. It mainly unified the scope of objects for recruiting personnel for rural public welfare posts at the grassroots level, fund management, post development, and post management.
In terms of position development and setting, the new regulations are clear, and the principles of "position setting according to demand, personnel according to position, dynamic management, and overall quantity control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible", and "one person one position, voluntary disclosure, unified management" shall be followed.
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, publicity, employment, pre-job training and arrangement.
In addition, the new regulations also clearly define the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare posts, and require the relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution of rural public welfare posts. The regulations also stipulate that the development departments of each rural public welfare post should purchase commercial insurance for accidental injury for personnel stationed in rural public welfare posts.

Although the right-wingers had a successful period in history, it was not long-lasting. Therefore, they were short-lived because they flourished with a little sunshine and perspired with a little boiled water; they could reach the horizon of Longxi with a little success, but were easily defeated with a little setback.
But to be realistic, the right-wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied in terms of defining truth standards after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving technology, promoting institutionalization of administration and protecting human rights.
Thirdly, as for me, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I pay attention to his statements and also respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes seriously the social issues in China.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I think that anti-necessity revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, political groups mixed up, and foreign countries taking advantage of the situation.
Fourth, to change or improve China, one must have patience and a sense of responsibility to the country and its people. Those who attempt to take advantage of the situation for political gain are not right-wingers, they are scoundrels.
Let's talk some more.
Left, in fact, is a group of abandoned children of the times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's words and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the left has no such luck, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party throws away!
Fifth, I recently saw some friends arguing with the villains while refuting Left Dementia, and they were quite angry. I think it's unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors or lunatics, they are both unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, let alone make the rebels and the left crazy admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this: when the traitors curse you for five cents, when the left lunatics curse you for the right dog, it proves that our middle path is correct!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but they forget them when they get old, or they pursue their ideals but become obsessed.
Gradually drifting away from the ideal, even the dragon-slaying youth eventually became an evil dragon.
In my opinion, left and right usually refer to constraint and freedom. Due to the innate genetic factors of Chinese history and culture, the overall Chinese should be left-leaning.
Meanwhile, the right-wing in China emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthens regulation, focusing more on fairness and security.
Now the overall society hopes to pay more attention to fairness, while the Sino-US rivalry is definitely left-leaning, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Even though I don't understand, just give it a like and it's done.
Nothing more to say, Flower is so righteous.
In the past two years, the US blockade and siege of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "US-based" companies.
The US has been suppressing China's chip industry, requiring its own companies and allied countries' related companies to block China's chip industry at the same time, resulting in orders and profits of global chip suppliers being affected, leading to reduced R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing a shortage and disruption of the global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has spread to major industries around the world, such as car companies shutting down and mobile phone prices rising, almost all industries that use chips are severely affected.
In order to gain control over "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' tech giants are beginning to take the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control rights, restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the Americans have recently taken frequent actions, either hosting the "Chip Summit" or inviting 64 countries' giants to establish a Semiconductor Alliance and subsidizing US local technology giants. For example, in order to regain its leading position in the chip field, the old US technology giant Intel invested US$20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened its chip outsourcing business to the outside world.
Most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC and is likely to take away TSMC's "rice bowl".
The reason for this certainty is that Intel, as an old-fashioned American technology giant, has been deeply cultivating the semiconductor field for decades, with a large number of personnel and technical reserves, and will surely rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou disdainfully dismissed Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a shocking statement. Regarding Intel's investment in building a wafer factory, Zhang Zhongmou bluntly said: Intel's building of a chip foundry is quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou's disdain for Intel's foray into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou still remembers the grudges between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the pearl of the US manufacturing industry, occupying the peak position in the world and dominating the world semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were held by a few powerful players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chips were designed, manufactured and tested by a single factory, Intel being the representative of that era.
However, this model puts a lot of pressure on small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs have to give up in the face of huge production line construction costs.
Under the call of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to appear division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, then a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Not long after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was born.
TSMC has targeted its main business to the single link of "wafer processing", providing only subcontracting services for wafer manufacturing without design.
At the time, newly established TSMC was a small fry compared to the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously had a high self-esteem and looked down on TSMC, so it decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel was looking down on wafer fabrication services at the time.
It is unexpected that the giant which looked down on the wafer fabrication service in the past now has to start doing wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that Intel's entry into wafer fabrication was ironic.
Now the market value of TSMC has surpassed Intel.
Faced with TSMC's aggressive attack, Intel naturally cannot remain stagnant.
Now, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel still remains at 14nm from seven years ago.
Catching up is not an easy task.
Don't wait.
It's been 2 hours since I placed the order at 19:06.
Let's take a look at some "weird hot searches" today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February 2 Dragon Raising Head, Good Friends Price Increase, Huo La La Incident, public opinion spreads to form a peak, and then [Index Decline] (smooth curve) eventually dissipates, if secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small hump reappearing.
They look no different from the "Network Public Opinion Evolution Model" displayed on the website of the Cyberspace Administration.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present them in the form of a solitary peak, sawtooth, and cliff.
【Isolated Peak】Refers to artificially heating up quickly to attract public attention; 【Sawtooth】Refers to periodic heating up to ensure the topic stays on the hot search list; 【Cliff】Refers to collective withdrawal, the hot search has fulfilled its "function" and is ready to take on new tasks and move on to new battlefields.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat of one event is exactly the trough of another event, and the time difference is not a second, which must be a unified batch of water army receiving the task and launching a new round of attack.
The professionalization of black public relations can be seen in one spot: dozens of hot searches on the list at the same time, which attract attention, are responsible for popular science, incite war, divert attention, influence cognition, mislead judgment, stir emotions, and influence decisions. Black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes for fine-grained warfare, taking into account almost all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Propagation is a science, leaving aside all subjective factors such as position and emotion, and only from objective data, black public relations will also be nowhere to hide.
Wherever we go, we will leave traces, and we will dig out these traces together.

Xinhua News Agency Beijing December 12th. According to reports from Xinhua News Agency's overseas correspondents, Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection with the new coronavirus variant, the Omikron Rong strain.

According to Minister of Health, Kailesh Jagutpal, one of the infected persons is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27th; the other infected person is a local resident of Mauritius who tested positive for the nucleic acid test on November 30th after coming into contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected persons have turned negative and they have now returned to their respective residences.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th the country's first confirmed cases of three infections of the Omicron Rho strain.
These three people are all students. They returned from abroad at the beginning of this month. As they are all mild cases, they were not hospitalized for treatment.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron Rho virus, the government is increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th of next year, passengers over 12 years old entering by plane must pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport.
The Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that it will begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.

Address: 12th Floor, Happiness Garden, No. 156, Huancheng South Road
At first it was introduced by a friend, so I chose to come and take a look. My initial budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
As soon as they arrived at the store, they began a series of scams.
This is my first time to the store, I just showed them my house type map, they didn't go to measure the house in person, they could even give me a quotation that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000, they roughly showed me their materials but I don't know what brand they are.
Their second scam is that as soon as you get to the store, they will drag you to pay the deposit (and this money can never be refunded unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount you could get if you paid the deposit today.
This is a big pit, I am a living example of being cheated, in the impulse of the mind, paid a deposit of more than ten thousand.
His offer to me has many problems - 70,000 does not include water and electricity renovation, does not include any doors and cabinets, and bathrooms, and these three are the major expenses for basic installation.
In addition to these, their service charge is higher than that of other companies.
I lost trust in this company when they asked me to sign a contract without explaining anything.
When I went to get my money back from them, they acted very experienced, with a special team to deal with you.
No matter what, it will be the customer's problem and they are completely blameless.
All kinds of shirking responsibility, there are still many details, don't want to say one by one are tears, in short, don't choose them, because my friend's house they decorated is also of poor quality, and they will charge you various fees in the later stage.
Damn it, they are the same scammers who used to be called Longtou Decoration, now they changed to Da Mei, and now it seems like they have closed down and changed to something else.
So don't choose such a rip-off decoration company.
In the future, when we make choices, let's Baidu and check these consultations, because decoration is not a small amount of money.
To ask a question to the merchant, please log in or register first.
Commercial reviews of all forms are strictly prohibited. Please refer to the merchant inclusion statement for details.
The Dianping Kunming Decoration Design Channel provides you with the latest merchant information such as the address, phone number, and business hours of Da Mei 360 Integrated Home Decoration. If you are looking for a decoration company, go to Dianping.
It's so scary, please cancel the order if it doesn't arrive within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, change the address?
Alright, don't cancel this conversation then. If the refund isn't received within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it was possible to cancel within 15 minutes.
The saliva chicken should be cooked, but the one received is raw, so it can't be eaten.
The starry sky has an appointment | The Gemini Meteor Shower will reach its peak on the 14th - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian). Astronomy popularization experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of the same day.
Beijing Astronomy Enthusiasts Anjiu took a photo of the Gemini Meteor Shower on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is currently the second known meteor shower not to be "fostered" by a comet.
Tianjin Astronomical Society director and astronomy popularization expert Xiu Lipeng introduced that, just like the New Year's movie, the Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and its "release period" can last from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is known for its large and steady flow, and is known as one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, along with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor bodies move slowly, with a rich color, and there are also many fireballs, which are suitable for both visual observation and astrophotography for beginners.
Yang Jing, a Tianjin astronomy enthusiast, photographed the Gemini meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that the Gemini meteor shower this year will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14th, with a ZHR (the number of meteors visible per hour under ideal observation conditions, with the radiant point directly overhead) of 150.
A recommended index chart for the Gemini meteor shower.
Last year, the Gemini meteor shower "Luo Ying Bin Fen" left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be interfered by moonlight, and the level of excitement will be discounted.
On the 14th of the lunar calendar, it is November 11th, and the moon phase is a full moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation, but fortunately, the moon will set in the later half of the night. At this time, the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the few hours after the moon sets in the late night, but be sure to keep warm.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide view facing northeast in the suburbs or countryside. Then wait patiently until the moon sets and observe it with the naked eye.
It should be noted that the flow of the Gemini meteor shower is large in all directions, so there is no need to keep staring at the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing.
Friends who like photography to take beautiful 'meteor shower' shots should choose a wide angle and large aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Tripod, spare battery, and shutter release cable are also essential considering stability and sustainability.

What are the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs?
In my understanding, the traditional television mentioned by the questioner should refer to the LCD TV, and the difference in market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly includes the following two points:
First, laser TVs focus more on the large-screen market.
Compared to the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or laser TVs themselves are products born for large screens.
Currently, the mainstream LCD TVs are mostly between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting the user's demand for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the shipment and sales of laser TVs in the world have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches or more.
According to Zhongyi Kang's forecast, in 2020, the sales of laser TVs will increase by more than 140%, continuing to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason for its good performance in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TVs in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of the liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of the object under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The Sase Laboratory of China Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute and the ophthalmologists from Beijing Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through a strict comparison test of laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions of the population.
Data confirms that laser TVs indeed have strong eye protection characteristics and even have certain improvement effects in certain aspects.
With the increasing emphasis on visual health, laser TVs not only attract more and more users with their eye protection advantages, but also open up another breakthrough in the TV market.
Secondly, laser TVs focus more on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuously declining prices of LCD TVs, the prices of laser TVs currently on the market are mostly above ten thousand yuan, and with the upgrade of size and light source, the prices are gradually climbing.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It must make sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology levels, laser TVs have many advantages that liquid crystal TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, which can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, with little space required and a small host, occupying very little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach over 2000 lumens.
In addition to the lower heat generation, the lower equipment loss also makes the life of the TV longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with real 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, biomimetic screen and other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It is not a pseudo-demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs are not the dishes of audio-visual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. After weighing, you can judge it yourself. I'm afraid to listen to one side.
In short, ultra-wide angle near-focus projectors - laser TVs, in order to be close to the screen, have to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and reflectors, which does not conform to the best optical design.
In order to shield some ambient light, the use of microstructured Fyner curtains is expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be exchanged for a 65-inch LCD.
Additionally, I particularly despise projector manufacturers using diffuse reflection as a selling point for being good for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light. If you diffuse it to the ceiling, the eyes can't see it either. Even if you take LCD TVs seriously, it is also diffuse "direct" light. When you turn on the TV, isn't the ceiling illuminated too?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffusely reflective, it can't form an image at all.
What is really uncomfortable is that the hot spot (light spot) effect of the high gain screen is neglected, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes from a certain angle.
The Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery, specializing in quality products, currently has no branches.
After adding WeChat to make a reservation, the lady sent me the available time slots, and she replied to my messages in a timely manner.
Before going, I looked at the store's shooting works, mostly outdoor wedding dresses, very beautiful, and there were many shooting styles involved.
After arriving that day, I had a brief conversation with the little sister about my ideas. She was very patient and helped me try on two sets of clothes that I was struggling with. Finally, I decided to start makeup and styling~ The photographer will set up some props before shooting and guide the action. He is also very meticulous about every detail.
But it might not be the style I wanted because we didn't communicate the specific shooting ideas, but it should be nice looking 🙊🙊
After taking the photos, the photographer will help to select the photos and communicate the post-production style. It feels quite thoughtful.
It will take about half a month to repair the film, just wait for the result~
I won the photography-themed "king's meal" activity for the second time~ Most of the clothes in the venue can be chosen for shooting.
Finally, I chose a black chiffon dress to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process will take about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge is my younger brother from the post-95s generation. He feels a bit inexperienced, so I hope he can give more advice on customer shooting guidance in the future. He is quite talkative and the shooting process was quite pleasant.
Wen She Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery - Quality Selection Store - Reply
Let's go to the homepage and take a look at Queenie too~
First fill in your name and phone number when you arrive at the store, then choose the clothes, wedding dresses can also be selected. After changing three or four sets of clothes, they were still very patient. After selecting, makeup took a long time, and the service attitude was also good. Later, the shooting will teach you how to pose. It just feels like the face is too big in the photos. The retouching said it would take half a month, and it was sent in three or four days. It feels like there is no difference from the original.
The environment is generally good.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are roughly three makeup locations, inside is a photography studio.
The service is very warm and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the poses seriously.
If unsatisfied, the photographer will proactively suggest a reshoot.
[Experience] The original double eyelids may have been over-styled, resulting in three eyelids.
Even the eyebrows were shaved off, which is a bit awkward for daily life without makeup.
The photos were delivered in ten days, but the photoshopping effect was not very satisfactory, and the double eyelid stickers were still very obvious.
Because I wasn't quite sure what style I wanted, I tried on two sets. After looking back and forth, I still chose the black dress. The lady said this set was more of a Hepburn retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my hair and makeup. The hairdresser and makeup artist were both very patient in helping me. The effect was very satisfactory.
After doing my makeup and hair, I started taking pictures. The photographer directed me to pose throughout the process, which was very relaxed and harmonious.
After taking the photos, I carefully selected four of my favorites for retouching. The photographer said he would have the finished product within 15 days and I am very satisfied with the outcome.
It has been 3 days without a reply... Due to your system not being able to recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card for payment.
I have to pay for shipping every time now.
Can I be exempted first and you collect my monthly fee after you finish the investigation? Is this okay?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
According to the conditions set, to become an insurance broker company, three key words must be met: shareholders, the initiator has no major violations in the past three years, and the minimum limit is RMB 50 million, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three requirements are actually very strict. In summary, one must have the strength, be approved by the national authoritative department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (regulating insurance companies and banks nationwide), and the shareholders must have good style. As an insurance broker, Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance, the insured does not need to question too much whether Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is regular or not, after all, these three thresholds are not something that any insurance company can reach.
On this point, it's not bad, it's trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products, Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched He Tai Super Mary No. 5 Critical Illness Insurance. The claim party and the insurer are both He Tai Life Insurance. Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode: the products of Internet platforms, because of the lack of operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of business personnel, the general cost-effectiveness of Internet products is relatively high, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of the insured, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of the professionalism of the insurance salesperson, this is particularly important because insurance is an industry with very high professional requirements. Many customers of Internet products can insure themselves, which can lead to many misunderstandings. In terms of health disclosure and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when they are insured, thinking that they are healthy or compliant, which can easily lead to many potential claims risks and the risk of being rejected.
I have done insurance phone sales on "Tencent Weibao" (similar to Xiaoyusan, also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell everyone.
The insurance on the Internet is real and reliable, but it is people who are not reliable. There are no professional practitioners in the Internet channels, and there are also a lot of sales misguidance.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 critical illness insurance amount, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the heavy and light, will not tell the insured, the first month is 1 yuan, the second month is Need to be charged according to normal fees, ranging from tens to 200, many customers deduct fees for one or two years and do not know what they bought.
It's like getting 600 million from an insurance company for just one dollar (the world is full of surprises).
Free mobile phones are only given to special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888. If the winning SMS is sent out, no one will remind you if you don't redeem it.
This is another pitfall for the insured - the free 60000 critical illness coverage is short-term, and if there are no other commercial insurances, if a critical illness really occurs, 60000 won't be able to do anything, and the future life will start to be barefoot.
The state is also cracking down on the misdirection of internet insurance sales.
Therefore, in general, there is no problem with the platform or the product, but there is a problem with the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.
It is suggested that the poster should consider carefully. In fact, many offline insurance broker companies have more products and more opportunities for customers to choose from. Some products also have better cost-effectiveness than Internet products.
I have helped 59 internet customers myself, underwriting offline products, and saving each person 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If anyone has any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I am a Mingya Insurance Broker with 3 years of corporate management training experience, having served nearly a thousand corporate users and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will customize insurance products based on customer needs. During insurance, I will compare and contrast for customers and strive to get the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will do policy sorting, policy custody for customers, so that customers can be worry-free.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can help the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, internet insurance is an insurance business that allows the insured to complete all the insurance procedures by clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor does not need to sign either; all steps can be completed independently by the policyholder.
Although there is no "ceremony" for the purchase of internet insurance, and even no printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the "telephone sales" assembly line work, but such insurance purchases may also have a fatal problem, that is - subsequent services may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting for decades. Shouldn't we think carefully when we buy insurance and choose an "intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and provide us with services many years later?
How can I contact the delivery personnel?
It's almost 3 o'clock.
Is that supposed to be compensation for me?
I said to knock on the door to deliver the goods.
But the rider left it at the door, and then the person left.
Still wrong
Your rider has already picked up my takeaway at #NUMBER#, but I'm still being told to wait.
The rider received my takeout at 19:25, but still refuses to leave.
I have finished buying, do you want any other takeout?
What to do
Where did your rider go?
Still waiting?
I'm here to make a delivery.
Alright, if you don't cancel it, I'll call the police.
But my food will have safety and hygiene issues.

No problem, remember no need to arrange for resending, I have bought another one, don't want to waste.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of defamation and cursing, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to such villains.
If we don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
Starting from when you sent me a Facebook friend request, to when you posted sarcastic posts, and then when you tried to post my supposed home address and father's name on social media, I have taken a stance of not responding.
After that, you not only continued to tag me at a frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss some obscure and humiliating remarks about me on Facebook with your so-called friends, such as comments about my appearance, body shape, good upbringing, and whether or not to plant strawberries in bed. I...just let it go.
How did I know later that I received more friends sending me your Facebook friend account with a photo of you and sexually harassing comments.
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer stay silent.
After the news of my reporting to the police was uploaded, you didn't restrain yourself at all, but became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is or what your status is, in our society, it is necessary to respect both sexes.
Yes, you can continue this kind of sarcastic, subtle, humiliating, and insulting language, you can also continue to say that you are just caring and concerned about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your chart or continue to make all offensive statements.
That's right, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and my appearance and figure don't need you to comment on.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to humiliate herself for fame.
My friend asked me, how are you doing?
I said it, but you don't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's still okay after being bullied like this.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those who don't even have basic morality will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart of man.
I have cut out some of the messages for everyone to judge.
No one should be able to impersonate you for the post you sent yourself, right?
I can only say you are a civilized public enemy.
A knowing smile
Vietnam People's Network - Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Minh Chinh attended the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum.
Two major conferences were held during the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, discussing topics around digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development in the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic and after the epidemic.
Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung stated that despite the ongoing spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, the number and revenue of Vietnamese digital technology companies still maintained a growth momentum of nearly 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam has cultivated a number of typical digital products, focusing on solving the major problems facing Vietnam. Many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has been improved.
Minister Ruan Mengxiong called on digital technology companies to take responsibility for developing the country's digital transformation platform, and to take on the task of developing these national digital platforms is to take on the mission of the country.
At the forum, leaders from various departments and state organs, enterprises, organizations and individuals who are studying, developing, applying and transferring digital technology shared mobilization and gathering of social resources to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, join hands to promote the country's digital transformation, Zhu Hui's breakthrough ideas and solutions for economic recovery after the epidemic, etc.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized in his speech at the forum that digital transformation is the only way for the world and an objective requirement for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, digital transformation services for all, so it is necessary to mobilize the whole people to participate.
People and enterprises are the core, main body, goal and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies should be for the people and businesses.

The mainstream of the Yangtze River achieves full coverage of water green comprehensive service areas - Xinhua News Network
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian): The Chongqing Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Zone was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water green comprehensive service zone officially put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Zone was officially put into operation on the 8th.
So far, the water-based green comprehensive service zone has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Transport's Yangtze River Navigation Administration, introduced that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have built 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the majority of sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
The full coverage of the water-based green comprehensive service area is another milestone event in the construction of the Yangtze River green shipping, and the Yangtze River vessel pollutant reception and shipping service capacity have been significantly improved.
According to the introduction, the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility for providing all-round production and living services for ships and crew, helping the crew to solve the "urgent distress" problem.
The two water green comprehensive service areas built and operated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River integrate life service, production service and government service, taking green environmental protection as the theme and ship repair and ship emergency rescue service as the characteristics, realizing the "one-time mooring and multiple services" of ships in the port, which will make the work of the crew sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and life more convenient.
The latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China; US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal, the rare visit to Guam, sends an important signal to the US allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform of China Think Tank, on January 9, a satellite discovered the US Navy's USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic stronghold on the first island chain of the Western Pacific.
The platform is expected that the "Carl Vinson" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, the US Navy aircraft carrier currently cruising in the Pacific Ocean is the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3rd.
The USS Lincoln also carried its first F-35C squadron, which is part of the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region also has the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser "Shangpulan Lake" and the missile destroyer "Stoke Dar".
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception) US Three Aircraft Carriers Gather Around China, The Strongest Weapon Rarely Visits Guam On January 17, 2022, US Navy Carrier-based Transport Aircraft CMV-22B Flight Route.
According to CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal visited Guam last weekend, an unusual occurrence. (Source: Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness)
The USS Nevada, a nuclear-powered submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US Naval Base in Guam last Saturday (January 15).
The US Navy's three aircraft carriers are gathering around China, the strongest weapon rarely visiting Guam. Analysts say this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first visit of an American ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The US Navy's three aircraft carriers have gathered around China, the strongest weapon has rarely visited Guam. In recent years, China has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands.
The picture is of Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands of China.
In a statement, the US Navy said that the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada's visit to Guam strengthened cooperation between the US and its allies in the region, demonstrating the US's capability, flexibility, readiness, and its continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are usually referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Raging Submarines" in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secret of ballistic missile submarines has made "Thunder Submarine" the "most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad", which also includes launch wells for ballistic missiles on the US mainland, as well as bombers such as B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
Talking to friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta, with a market cap evaporating to $251 billion, why did Zuckerberg respond with "facing unprecedented competition"?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with revenue mainly coming from advertising. Today's money-making advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are all Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is the largest "advertising alliance", many apps external Meta advertising, through Meta's advertising platform is to realize monetization.
But, times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta has difficulty obtaining user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, and it will clearly prompt users whether to allow the App to access their information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not to allow it.
If Google sticks another knife in, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta is not doing business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies doing overseas business.
Meta has about hundreds of offices in Hong Kong and several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, and Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, most of the money is spent on Meta.
Interestingly, ByteDance's TikTok is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
All the domestic agents are helping ByteDance to advertise in Meta, and the performance of Meta in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't specifically looked into it recently, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money on a large scale overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and older, and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only focuses on income, but more importantly, on expectations for the future.
Clearly, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke of the "Metaverse".
The Metaverse should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the realization cycle of the Metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the next two to three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Despite Facebook's current popularity, it is facing a strong sense of crisis. With annual revenue of between 10 and 20 billion US dollars, it has no strong fortress to protect it compared to other internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although his several social software now have a higher daily activity and are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has no confidence in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, and the overthrow is just a blink of an eye.
Attempting to create a concept of the universe that is out of reach in a short period of time is very dangerous, which is why Mark Zuckerberg changed the company's name and kept looking for new paths. However, I think his choice of path is wrong and is a dead end. These are my thoughts for reference.
