The reason I left the PDP.
Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has stated some reasons for his departure from the PDP to the APC.
If not forgotten, Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, defected from the PDP to the APC this week.
The Speaker said that he should remain loyal to Governor Bala of the PDP in Bauchi State and help the masses to win the 2019 election, otherwise he should gather and leave the party and go back to the APC.
The main reason for my departure to Bauchi state is the way PDP is ruling.
Nobody knows the role I played in the gubernatorial election which the former Minister of Abuja, Bala Mohammed, won against the incumbent Governor, Mohammed Abubakar.
But now I'm criticizing the government of Bala.
Instead of continuing to stay in the PDP, they gave me what they had promised so I left them and returned to where I came from.
The Speaker wrote a resignation letter from the PDP which he sent to the Chairman of the party in Bogoro C, in Bauchi State.
Finally, he said, just as he had reminded the other governors where they had failed and where they should fix it, Bala was not negligent.
Let's go on a trip and let them come.
A dust storm arose in a house located in Kano.
The fire started around 10 pm and lasted for almost two hours, despite the efforts of the Kano State Fire Service, security personnel and the people of the town to put it out.

The Kano State Fire Service has confirmed the incident, saying that at the time of this report, it is still collecting information to identify the cause and the loss caused by the fire, as the agency's spokesman Sa'idu Muhammad Ibrahim has stated.
On the other hand, my report says that some robbers tried to break into the Kofar Ruwa market to steal, but the police and security personnel tried to stop them and protect the people's property.
In this regard, we contacted the Kano State Police Command's spokesman, DSP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, who confirmed the incident.

The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has announced that it is testing 40 coronavirus drugs submitted to it by traditional medicine manufacturers.
Commissioner Mojisola Adeyeye announced that on Tuesday in Abuja.
Mojisola said that tests are being conducted to ensure the quality of medicines so that no harm is caused when seeking treatment.
After the announcement of the Corona virus, traditional medicine practitioners intensified their research to ensure that they were not left behind in finding a cure for the disease.
Many of them have submitted their medicines to the government for testing and verifying its authenticity.
Furthermore, NAFDAC has set out certain standards and regulations to be followed in the preparation of the medicine.
The quality of animal drugs will be tested for the first time here.
Mojisola warned those administering medication not to recklessly administer any medication without the permission of the authorities.
In May, the NAFDAC announced that only on social media and newspaper websites can one see news of people claiming to have discovered a traditional remedy that will cure the Coronavirus.
Adeyeye has revealed that only one person has challenged the NAFDAC to verify the authenticity of the traditional medicine he claimed could cure Coronavirus.
He is not that person, it is not a cure for the disease he found.
He said that the symptoms of illness that can be seen are the symptoms of contracting the disease.
Moreover, some healers continued to challenge the authority of the agency with their support.

APC Accuses Governor Neja of Attempting to Introduce Factionism in the Party - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
The APC party issued a statement yesterday accusing the Governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, of attempting to bring division into the party.
The document, signed by the President of the Engineering Association Muhammad Jibrin Imam and the Secretary of the Association Barista Muhammed Liman, stated that in the six years the association has been in power in the state, only Naira 512 million has been received.
The statement continued that the meeting convened by the governor to reprimand those responsible for the water crisis, which was chaired on Monday last week, will help to bring about reforms in the party, where they said they had written to the party's national secretary about the ongoing events in the state.
According to Engineer Imam, "we understand that the Governor of Neja State is trying to divide the factions of the party by organizing a heated meeting, which is not based on any rules, so that any complaints against the party leaders should be written to the party secretary for investigation".
Continuing from the fact that in the past four years since the party was founded, 512 million naira is in the party's account.
He said that what he understood as the governor was to be part of the national reconciliation committee set up on July 25, 2020, which the president had appointed to lead the resolution of disputes between the parties and to withdraw the complaints lodged in court between the parties.
He said that the funds we obtained were used to pay the salaries of the party's secretaries and for other activities related to the party, such as organizing rallies and resolving some of the party's problems, such as providing health care due to lack of access to government funding, and no party funds were spent without authorization, and we challenge anyone to bring us evidence of misappropriation of party funds.
As I have stated, the local government elections that took place recently is the most important election that has been conducted in the country, which we conducted together with the former commissioners and the commissioners who are currently in charge of power in all twenty-five local governments in the state, and the funds spent on the elections were distributed to the commissioners so that they can bring their constituencies.
Therefore, it is wrong for anyone to say that party funds are being spent without any rules, this is almost an injustice and an attempt to give a bad name to the attempt to preserve it, he said there is no committee set up to investigate how party funds are spent and who set it up.
Among the money the complainant said was embezzled, it was money given by the national party treasurer, not any other money, so I challenge anyone to bring evidence to support this accusation in any way.
The Imam said that we should stand firmly in support of the APC party against any individual or group that attempts to undermine the party, he added that any allegation against the party or any of its leaders from the state level should be written to the committee in charge of discipline as stated in section 21 (B) (d) of page 82 of the party's constitution.
Therefore, the members of the party have no role to play, especially if they try to take control of the committee, so their decision has no effect.
Therefore, the duly elected leaders of the party in the state, as provided in Article 21 of Section 87 of the party's constitution, shall be the only ones recognized and any other contrary to this shall not be recognized.
Because the court's ruling was to obey the leaders, they made a mistake.
He said that those who presented and agreed at yesterday's meeting, which did not improve, including Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, as well as Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all the commissioners, are not members of the party's approval committee in the state.
The committee to be formed by the party's water and salt members, the party's engineer Mohammed Imam, will be the only one to lead it, not the governor to lead the party's state leaders.
The statement further stated that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello reminded that the issue of fulfilling the promise made to the people of the state during the election, traveling with the party parents in the government so that everyone will benefit from the state and all constituencies through the provision of political positions, which is the problem of the governor and the party.
The letter commends the members of the National Assembly who attended the meeting and draws attention to the need for peace among all the problems between the members of the party, which is not surprising to the members who know their illness and refuse to accept fraud as a party policy.
Therefore, there is a need for the chairman of the state committee to draw the attention of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello to the appropriate position so that he does not attempt to disrupt the politics of the state.
Nigeria is at the forefront of Internet economy - Freedom Radio Nigeria
The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Pantami, said that the country is ready to take advantage of the digital economy.
He also said that the government is ready to work with experts from universities and other stakeholders to ensure that the country is kept up to date with modern technology in all areas.
Dr. Isa Ali Fantami stated this at an international conference on the advancement of communication technology held via the internet.
Furthermore, the minister added that one of the first steps taken by the government to ensure that the country is benefiting from communication technology is to change the name of the ministry from the Ministry of Communications to the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy Promotion through the Internet.
The availability of food does not guarantee good health for people in Nigeria.
Some scientists have warned people to avoid eating food that has been treated with preservatives, saying that eating such food can endanger one's health.
The experts gave this warning after conducting a research on the quality of food consumed in this country.
The research results showed that there are some foods that are fortified with iron to prevent them from spoiling.
The research also showed that this technology was used in the towns of Alabo and Busasshhen, where fish is sold to the public.
The ingredient is used so that when someone sees it, they will be interested in buying it and using it.
Furthermore, the food containing this preservative causes diseases such as fever, heart disease and other diseases.
He called on the people of this country to be careful in avoiding the use of these kinds of food for their health.
If not forgotten, the food technologist Grace Olasumbo has called on Nigerians to avoid eating fruits that have been ripened with Calcium Carbide.
Olasumbo stated that Sindarin Calcium Carbide is the most commonly used by traders to ripen fruits, that is, stone fruits.
Research shows that patience and perseverance are among the things that make traders use this resource to show the goods in one week.
Olasumbo stated that something that traders failed to see is the use of this technology to demonstrate the potential of medical products to cause harm to people.
The reason for this is diseases such as fever, eye infection, abdominal pain, headache, cough, hand and other diseases.
Acquit the Central Bank Governor of African countries from accusation - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
The panel of eminent persons chaired by former Irish Prime Minister Mary Robinson has cleared the President of the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina.
According to the committee, Mr. Akinwumi Adesina is not guilty of the charges of corruption leveled against him.
The news agency AFP reported that at the beginning of this year, a report of fifteen pages accused Mr. Adesina of sixty years of favoritism, mismanagement and self-interest.
However, the committee led by Robinson and the Gambian Chief Justice Hassan Jallow, as well as the Deputy Governor of the World Bank in charge of the operational sector, Leonard McCarthy, cleared the former Nigerian Minister of Agriculture of all charges against him.
The United States is behind the call for an investigation into Mr. Adesina following the whistle-blowing by the African Development Bank's management, prompting the establishment of a committee of experts to conduct an investigation into the allegations.
COVID-19 Has Prevented Trump's Rally in Florida.
Yesterday, Thursday, US President Donald Trump announced that he has cancelled the major Republican convention scheduled to give him a ticket to run in Jacksonville, Florida, in the coming weeks, due to the increasing number of coronavirus cases.
Therefore, the activities of the major conference will be held in North Carolina.
Trump said in Jacksonville that it would not be appropriate to hold a large gathering at this time.
President Trump moved a section of the GOP convention to Florida last month after a disagreement with Democratic party leaders in North Carolina over holding the convention in an enclosed room with his supporters without requiring face masks.
Some representatives of the Republican Party will gather in Charlotte, North Carolina, to vote for Trump on August 24th.
Trump said he will make an acceptance speech in a different format.
Trump, who has been in office for months, has been showing a lack of concern about the impact of the pandemic, recently saying that 99% of the cases seen in the US would not be a problem.

Achieving Our Goals of Providing Food and Clothing for the People - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the soul of life for all creatures, one cannot live without food.
This is the reason why the Chinese government is becoming more vigilant in ensuring the safety of the country's citizens and food.
In the past 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has achieved great successes in the field of food security, which has amazed the world given the large population of the country, estimated to be 1.4 billion Chinese.
This effort has helped a lot in the matter that has made China provide great contribution to eradicate hunger in the world, as the director of the Chinese State Administration of Grain, Zhang Wufeng, has said before, since 1949 until now, China has always put the issue of hunger alleviation in front of all its activities.
However, a few days ago, some people and some media outlets from the countries of the world again "expressed concern" about the issue of whether China can control the spread of the COVID-19 respiratory virus to the rest of the world?
We sincerely thank them for always taking care of the Chinese presence in this world.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the country has achieved the goal of providing sufficient food through its efforts.
Providing food and clothing for the needy is one of the major agendas of the ruling JKS party every day.
At the end of last week, the Secretary-General of the JKS, the President of China, Xi Jinping, issued an important order to stop food waste, indicating that everyone knows that all kinds of food and labor are obtained through hard work.
Although this year the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the world and caused economic disruption in China, China will still be able to provide its citizens with sufficient food.
According to the statistics released by the Chinese government on the amount of agricultural products, especially rice, that the country will obtain in 2020, the amount of rice obtained in the first half of 2020 was 27.29 million tons, an increase of 1.08 million tons, or 3.9%, compared to the same period in 2019.
He Bing Sheng, the former president of the Agricultural University of China, said that China has achieved great successes in terms of national wealth and food security compared to the early period of reform and opening up.
Huang Jikun, the director of the GONA research center of China at Peking University, told the reporter of "The China Science Daily" that the biggest challenge China is facing in the next two or three years is whether it can reduce the amount of coal and grain stored in warehouses.
Currently, the amount of grain each person in the world receives per year is 474 kilograms instead of the 400 kilograms that should be the norm.
And now, China is importing millions of tons of agricultural products for domestic livestock only.
Therefore, those who are concerned about the issue should calm down, take a bath and go to bed, or focus their attention on the affairs of their country.
The Sinawa can sustain themselves with the food they provide for themselves.
The reason I am prosecuting Ganduje in court - Abba K. Yusuf - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
The PDP gubernatorial candidate in Kano, Abba Kabir Yusuf, has stated his reasons for prosecuting the Kano Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and some businessmen before the High Court.
This was announced by the Senior Counsel, Bashir Tudun Wuziri, on behalf of Abba Kabir, who said he had filed a suit against the alleged appropriation of some government properties and public assets in Kano State by some traders.
The Kano State Governor, Abba Kabir Yusuf, also filed a suit against the state ministries of works, housing and transport, the state attorney general and the state commissioner of police and the state land bureau.
Abba Kabir Yusuf accused the Kano State Government of seizing some ancestral lands of the former Daula palace, which is now under the care of the University of Science and Technology in Wudil and the Shahuci airstrip, saying that it violates the laws of the country.
He only sang, announcing the rotation system in 2023.
The elder brother of President Muhammadu Buhari, Mamman Daura, has stated that the rotation of power in Nigeria has become a thing of the past.
Mamman Daura said that Nigeria has already done enough groundwork and should now focus on selecting the most suitable candidate for 2023.
BBC Hausa has published an interview with Mamman Daura in which he revealed this.
This system of electing a president in Nigeria has not brought about a desirable outcome since it was first implemented in 1999.
Instead of that, Daura said to focus on selecting the one who is deserving rather than following this lottery system.
Moreover, the Igbo people, known as Inyamirai, have challenged Daura on this statement.
He said that he and his brother President Buhari have completed their tenure of office by taking turns and now he is coming out to give advice that such should not be done in 2023.
Buhari was not chosen above all Nigerians, he was just chosen.
These senior security officers of our country who have been sitting in their seats for many years have not been removed, they are not better than the others in terms of work.
Eat Yam Porridge.
A political storm erupted in Nigeria on Wednesday when the Igbo Zalla Preservation Group, Ndigbo, condemned Mamman Daura for the statement made by the Nigerian leadership against the Inyamurai tribe.
In a discussion held with Daura, who is the nephew of President Muhammadu Buhari, he said that a zoning system will be adopted for the 2023 presidential election.
Therefore, beyond mere words, the Igbo have taken the initiative to send a message to Mamman Daura, calling for an end to tribalism.
On Wednesday, the Igbo ethnic group in the South-East region issued a statement that they will allow the South-East region to produce the President in the 2023 election, that is, the Igbo ethnic group.
The Spokesperson of the Igbo Ethnic Group, Emeka Attamah, said that Mamman Daura's words are like a declaration of Nigeria's presidency in 2023 for the Igbo people.
Since 2019, something has prevented Mamman Daura from speaking in public.
They killed Jonathan and now Daura is doing a northern tour to campaign for the presidency of Nigeria in the 2023 election.
After he finished discussing the issue that he took from his father's hand, the current leader of the country, he will come out with a new issue that we do not know about for the 2023 elections.
He should start to take on the role of a leader and embrace truth and hold it firmly.
If the leadership of this country in 2023 does not come out of its own volition, it should show love for its people and their welfare.
A VOA Discussion on Rape was Held.
The issue of violence against women and children has become a major concern in Northern Nigeria where reports of violations of children's rights have been reported.
People from various backgrounds attended the meeting on 23rd July to discuss how the situation is worsening in the country and how to resolve it.
The participants discussed issues such as the dowry imposed on girls and the strictness of some parents.
One of the mothers who attended Hajiya Fathi'a Sha'ibu's meeting, the widow of the former governor of Filato and Neja during the reign of the late Sani Abacha, described poverty as one of the reasons why parents impose restrictions on their children.
Hajiya Maryam, the mother of Nasir, the leader of a vigilante group that is fighting against this menace, said "First of all, we should educate mothers on the dangers of allowing their children to wander off, because only when a child is out of sight can harm be done to them".
We also call on teachers to start preaching with a loud voice to parents and siblings who commit rape against their children and wards.
The Member of the House of Representatives representing Maiyama, Koko and Besse constituencies in Kebbi State, Honorable Shehu Mohammad, expressed his concern and support for the enactment of a stringent law to punish anyone found guilty of rape in the country.
At the end, Hajiya Madina Dauda and Nasiru El-Hikaya, who led the meeting, thanked those who attended the meeting on behalf of the VOA, who accepted their invitation.
The Arewa Media Writers are committed to uniting the North.
Modern communication tools such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bakandamiya and others have been playing a major role in providing platforms for conversations, connecting people from different parts of the world, sending messages, news, and disseminating political, educational and business objectives.
Nigerian youths have embraced this new technology of using social media platforms to keep up with the times, to give them support or to express their opinion on issues that affect their lives.
We can say that these developments have brought us many advances that the youth of the North are benefiting from in business, economy, education and politics of the region.
Many people are eating by ordering online, getting jobs or expanding the jobs they are doing.
It is indeed a sad thing to see how some youths instead of taking advantage of the opportunity for progress that has been provided, some have resorted to following the footsteps of the destitute children of the southern part of the country who have fled the country and the world at large to cause mayhem, to engage in writing of libel and to insult authorities and elders.
What shows the lack of progress, is embedded in the lives of the youth of this country.
The arrival of the Arewa Media Writers in the country is a great blessing, to provide the Arewa youth with a good platform and clean environment to do their activities on Social Media, so that they can write meaningful articles and propagate the goals of the Arewa people.
It is now incumbent upon us to give this organization the support it needs to achieve its noble objectives, which will bring not only benefits to our region of the North, but to Nigeria as a whole.
We call on our youths, especially those using social media, to come together and protect the dignity of the North and its freedom, and to create a system that will bring change to everyone.
Just like our northern leaders such as the Sardauna of Sokoto, the first Northern Premier Sir Ahmadu Bello, and their contemporaries, they had the ambition to provide for the people of the North.
It is said that the late Malam Aminu Kano, who fought against injustice and oppression, once said, "Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows his own home!"
Therefore, we say that, as we call for the advancement of the country and the improvement of the governance system, at every level, we reiterate our call for the unity of the people of the North, without prejudice to religion or ethnicity, in order to bring progress to our region.
If we look at how the North used to be and how it is now, it is not the same.
Therefore, we should make use of the wisdom that God has given us to provide the North with a sustainable path to prosperity and economic development.
It is necessary for the North to create sources of revenue to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to provide funds.
If we really want progress in the North, we must give importance to education, agriculture, tourism, health and science and technology.
We can help without money, there are different ways to do it.
We see it this way, the North will fulfill our aspirations!
The North is our pride.
The government has allocated 126 billion naira for the renovation of hospitals in the country.
The Federal Government has allocated N126 billion from the economic revitalization plans to improve hospitals in the country.
The hospitals to be renovated include the FMC hospital, testing centers, the emergency care unit, the isolation centers for those with contagious diseases, and the teaching hospitals in the 36 states of the country.
Last year, some experts in the health sector called on government agencies to join hands in raising funds to improve the health sector in the country.
The experts made this call at a meeting to provide quality and accessible healthcare to people, which was held in Abuja.
The response of the candidate for the Senate seat representing Kwara North under the APC platform, Sadiq Umar, is that the Nigerian government should prioritize the improvement of the health sector in the country.
He said that not doing so has caused the sector to suffer from financial problems, which has caused it to rely heavily on the aid it receives from foreign countries.
Umar said that despite all the support they were receiving, there was no visible effort from the government in the health sector, which is why they began to withdraw the support they were giving.

People who will die of hunger in Africa will outnumber those killed by Coronavirus -IFAD.
The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), has announced that there are at least 23 million people facing famine in the countries of the Sahel region of Africa in 2020.
IFAD President Gilbert Houngbo made this announcement at the Zauren Tattauna Tattalin Arziki, World Economic Forum.

IFAD is a renowned organization that supports people living in rural areas to develop agriculture, providing them with nutritious food and income through farming.
The UN said that Coronavirus has highlighted the urgent need for a better system for food production, distribution and transformation.
Most people are frustrated because they cannot get modern transportation due to the ban on travel.
Furthermore, they cannot go to the farm and those who farm the farm produce for sale, the markets were closed except for them to continue selling the farm produce.
The report further states that in 2019, 135 million people were affected by hunger worldwide, 73 million of whom came from Africa, in 36 countries.
In Northern Nigeria, famine killed 5 million people in 2019.

A prominent figure in the Kaduna State community, Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje, has indicated that the only solution to the rape cases in the country, especially in Northern Nigeria, is to impose the death penalty on the perpetrators.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje announced this during his interview with Leadership Today in Kaduna, where he added that if the government confirms it after investigation, the only solution is to impose the death penalty.
Furthermore, making a judgement will reduce the number of rape cases that can be obtained, but the biggest relief is to change our mindsets.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje said that we should always remember to obey Allah and His Prophet, and to keep our promises, because no one knows when they will die.
It is shameful to say that a grown man should marry a young girl of three or five years and rape her.
He continued to say, between us and God, we will not continue to criticize leaders or kings, where he indicated that there is no way a country can progress if such chaos is present.
Furthermore, this is why we are in a state of lockdown and hardship in the country, because the rulers, governors, and president have no idea how to move the country forward.
Furthermore, they demolished that wall and another one emerged, so it is necessary for us to amend our ways so that God may bring us a solution to the rape issue.
It is announced that, even if it is done for safety, everything should be left to Allah because He is the one who relieves all distress and poverty of the people.
As they say, no matter what situation a person is in, Allah knows about it and there is nothing you can do but to be patient and humble, always think that you will die and always think that you have a past, if you have done something wrong.
It should be noted that the police, in accordance with the law, are doing their best to send those accused of rape to the court of law to do their best in this matter which has become a menace in our region of Northern Nigeria and in the country.

The problem is that people don't know that the world does not recognize the existence of a Northern Cyprus.
The United Nations does not approve of the country.

In South Africa, where this 85-minute film was made, many people said it exceeded the film.
Black is King, a film filled with songs led by the renowned American singer and songwriter, Beyonce, to guide, direct and complete.

The film was shot in America, West and Central Africa, and Europe, and it featured many African musicians.
This movie, which was released in July, was well received by the audience, but there were also some who didn't like it.
Some say that Beyonce, who was born in Houston, Texas in the US, appropriated African elements without following the rules, especially the African-inspired costumes in the film, although she has no roots in Africa.
Furthermore, in South Africa, we are proud of those who have taken part in making this film.
Sibusiso Mathebula, a film studies scholar, said he was honored to be included among the filmmakers.

King Motsoane said that Beyonce's fans in Africa and abroad - including African Americans in the US - have the opportunity to use what some consider African cultural artifacts.
He said he was interested in the movie.
The King said that women should be given lower positions in the society.
Therefore, their involvement in such influential matters is a source of strength.
The director said that watching Beyonce's movie made him interested in making his own movie to spread awareness about Africa.

He thought that the government would allocate one trillion dollars to alleviate the suffering caused by the coronavirus pandemic in the country.

On Friday, the first round of aid will cover those who have lost their jobs and have been given some financial assistance, and they will also receive an additional 600 per week in addition to what the states are providing.
The Republicans are concerned that this scheme means paying people who have earned a salary when they were working, if the federal government's support is combined with that of the state.
However, the Democrats on our side have challenged this statement, saying that due to the increasing spread of the coronavirus, some employees do not have the peace of mind to return to work.

The SERAP human rights and economic development organization has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately suspend the Nigerian Attorney General Abubakar Malami and the Registrar General of the Corporate Affairs Commission over the planned registration of places of worship.
According to SERAP, this measure is a violation of human rights as enshrined in the Nigerian constitution.
Before human rights organizations could express their opinion on this government measure, leaders of different religions had already presented their complaints to the Buhari government, asking them to resubmit the bill to the House of Representatives for review and approval, so that it would not conflict with the religious freedom and tolerance provided by the country's constitution.
Pastor John Buro, the head of Christianity in Kaduna State, told the Muryar Amurka reporter that this law does not have a basis, but if the government is trying to prevent worship or impose restrictions.
Only start to use the means to monitor and track all those who violate the law without introducing a new law.
His part, Dr. Bashir Yankuzo, the Vice Chancellor of the Science University in Minna said that although the government has the right to monitor companies and organizations for national security, this does not mean that the freedom of any individual or group should be restricted.
Now what is left to be seen is whether the government will listen to this outcry of the people.
The Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA) has been trying to block the PREMIUM TIMES website on the internet.
The Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA) has taken up the responsibility of providing web hosting services to the Premium Times, a renowned online newspaper in Nigeria.
This firewall attempted to block access to websites, which is a common practice for people who control access to websites, but it was unsuccessful.
He began to practice hacking since February 28, where he hacked into the university's computer systems, and he continued to carry out his attacks by using the university's data.
He then tried to hack into the PREMIUM TIMES internet server using a computer and then attacked the GSM phone again.
For five days he tried to break into the main page of the PREMIUM TIMES website, but he was unsuccessful, even though he used various modern technology tools.
It was not successful in getting away, because the university did not know that the PREMIUM TIMES newspaper had a strong program that it had built up and a strong gate that a petty thief could not break through.
Furthermore, PREMIUM has experienced security personnel of the modern Babban Rumbun Intanet site, including the PREMIUM TIMES Warlord, the PREMIUM TIMES Grandmaster, and the PREMIUM TIMES Webmaster.
These security personnel are well-versed in modern techniques for thwarting any malicious attack or any attempt to infiltrate the PREMIUM TIMES database.
The types of content that the PREMIUM TIMES website offers are:
At 8 o'clock in the morning, he started to unlock the door of the PREMIUM TIMES main building, to see how he could break in, and completely ransack the building.
He was successful at night, the next morning at 6:15 he tried again, this time using "WPScan", which is used to detect the strength or weakness of security measures of major websites like PREMIUM TIMES.
After 90 minutes, he began to attempt to use the power of modern computer technology, the "custom script".
He then tried to do everything he could by hacking the PREMIUM TIMES website completely.
How to Cure a Cold:
This patch maker will know that PREMIUM TIMES has done a thorough investigation of the small bugs and major viruses that enter the modern communication portals to patch or delete their pages.
This lack of knowledge is what made all the tools he used, all the old tools that could not cause any harm or damage to PREMIUM TIMES.
On this day, he faced a lot of difficulty and exhaustion in order to take the route of DDOS in the NTP Likau River, which is an old route that has been used since Kano of the village.
On March 3, he tried to delete all the data and thoughts in his mind, but he was unsuccessful.
This initiative to open the main PREMIUM TIMES office came a few days after PREMIUM TIMES published a report on the rift between President Muhammadu Buhari's National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno, and the late Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari.
Some students of the Federal University of Technology in Akure have informed PREMIUM TIMES that the university has hired some hackers to attack the PREMIUM TIMES website and either damage or destroy it.
However, when PREMIUM TIMES contacted the FUTA University, it distanced itself from this attempt to shut down the PREMIUM TIMES main Internet hub.
FUTA said that only if a student in the university is the one trying, without the help of FUTA.

However, the active civic organizations of the city said that drafting the law is easy, but implementing it is the challenge.

Peace, Hausa-Fulani have reached an agreement of peace between them.
The Atyap, Fulani and Hausa communities living in Zangon Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State have successfully concluded a peace meeting to promote lasting peace in their area.
The participants of the meeting who showed their commitment to promote peace, reconciliation and mutual forgiveness have rejected violence, looting and destruction of properties in their region.
They also requested their assistance to help security agencies and intelligence services to apprehend any criminals hiding in their areas.
The meeting also commended the government's effort to deploy security personnel in the area, and also commended the various youth groups for their commitment to mutual respect and to avoid anything that could lead to conflict in the area, as well as the efforts of the youth to achieve the success of this peace agreement between them.

Following the dismissal of the Judges by Governor Ganduje, Ado and Sanusi, they will be replaced by new appointees in Kano.
Governor Abdullahi Ganduje has directed the Kano State House of Assembly to amend the 2019 Kano State Law, in order to ensure the recognition of the two major Kano State vassals of the late Sarki Ado Bayero and Sarki Sanusi, so that the law will recognize them as the major rulers of Kano.
The Speaker of the Kano State House of Assembly, Abdullahi Gafasa, read the request of Governor Ganduje before the Assembly and it is expected that they will discuss the matter before the end of July.
The rulers who returned the Kano Emirate were Aminu Babba Ɗan'agundi and Sanusi Ado-Bayero, who was the King of Dawaki Mai Tuta and the Grand Vizier of Kano.
It was the Kings Ado and Muhammadu Sanusi who removed him, on the suspicion of treason.
Father Dan'agundi was challenged to go to court.
The Sharia has been practiced for 17 years until the High Court ruled that it should stop.
It is also what Ganduje wants to do with his throne, and to amend the law to be among the contenders for the throne of the Kano Emirate.
Ado Bayero was removed from office in 2003 after he was accused of corruption and meddling in politics.
He was appointed to set up a committee to investigate it, but he was invited to appear before the committee to defend himself.
From there, he appealed to the High Court of Kano State to the Court of Appeal.
Before the High Court, the Federal High Court of Appeal overturned the decision to reinstate Aminu Babba to his seat.
Furthermore, the Kano Emirate under the rule of Muhammad Sanusi II, took action, where the Koli Court declared the removal of him as the Governor of Gabasawa, and the Sultan of Dawaki Mai Tuta, on the 5th of June.
After the removal of Sanusi Bayero, the Emir of Kano refused to accept the appointment of Muhammad Sanusi II as the King of Kano in June 2014.
He was later appointed as the Managing Director of the National Water Resources Agency under Jonathan's administration.
He is the one appointed as Wamban Kano, under the current King of Kano.

NAPTIP arrested traffickers and rescued 71 people in Kano State.
The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) in Kano State has arrested three human traffickers and rescued 71 people from their captivity in the state.
The Commissioner of the Kano State Ministry, Shehu Umar, announced this on Friday during an interview with the Nigerian News Agency.
He said the agency has imposed restrictions on travelers after obtaining confidential information on the activities of travelers in the state.

Out of the three people we arrested, two were from Cameroon and one from Nigeria and their ages were all between 21 and 36.
Come with these people as they go to Algeria, Morocco and Libya.

Striving and Perseverance in Pursuing My Goals is Something in My Heart - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Longyuan Village in Hongsipu District of Wuzhong City in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is a self-governing village located in the northwest of China.
There is a famous woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (her Islamic name) who is renowned for her struggles in life and her success in overcoming poverty.
The labyrinth tells us that effort, perseverance and striving for success are in the heart.
First of all, Li Yaomei or Sadiya never attended school with the intention of taking classes, which is why she couldn't read or write.
May Allah grant her wisdom, intelligence and a lot of wisdom, where she becomes an example in the fight against poverty.
Twenty years ago, Madam Li Yaomei suffered from a uterine tumor, which led to her undergoing three surgeries.
After her accident, she encountered a terrible disaster, now she is traveling with a cast on her leg.
These challenges she faced put her in a difficult situation, even the issue of medication, the reason why she had to accept a debt of about 3 million Yuan, equivalent to about 16 million Naira.
The surprise is that this challenge faced by Malama Sadiya opened up a way for her to find courage and strength to improve her life.
Furthermore, the financial support provided by the Chinese government has strengthened her courage.
Craftsmanship is the art of making different objects using tools.
Due to her efforts, her business has grown significantly, where different employees are giving her orders.
In addition, she created many machines that helped her simplify the task.
For example, it used to take 15 minutes to connect one main cable, but now in this time, it can connect up to 5 cables.
In addition, it provided additional engines that clean up the environment it pollutes.
Furthermore, there is an engine that makes it easier for women to prepare animal food, and now they are selling these engines to those who need them.
From the challenges that Malama Sadiya has faced and the efforts she is still making to improve her life and that of her employees, it can be understood that indeed he who seeks shall find.
Fighting poverty and improving life is not something that can be left to the government alone.
If the government provides support, but people do not have the means or the desire to improve their lives by taking on work according to their circumstances, then progress will only be made without achieving any goal.
The labyrinth shows that running a business or undertaking to make money does not require large amounts of money or trips to other cities or countries.
She should consider her situation and make use of the resources available in her environment to improve her life.
Moreover, Madam Sadiya carried out these tasks without relying on her husband, as he had already left her.
Indeed, effort, perseverance and striving for success is something that is in the heart.
Furthermore, it shows the strength that women have to change their lives and stand up for themselves without seeking help from anyone.
This lesson shows that whatever a person does, he should stand by his conscience, for relying on someone else is not certain.
Indeed, Malama Sadiya was a diligent, intelligent and wise woman who became an example and a lesson to other people.
So far, up to the month of March, Mrs. Sadiya has completed the payment of all the debts she was owing, and has also stopped receiving government assistance based on her own income.

Last week, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, expressed concern about the measures taken by some countries to restrict access to the COVID-19 vaccine that is hoped to be available, stating that it is necessary to avoid showing favoritism to different countries while distributing the vaccine.
And it is necessary to distribute the resources in a fair way throughout the world, because that would be in line with the major objectives of different countries.
Indeed, some American politicians are pursuing the goal of gaining an advantage over their rivals in terms of distributing the vaccine against the virus, as well as undermining the cooperation between countries in the fight against the pandemic.
As of now, the total number of people confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 worldwide has already exceeded 23 million.
In the numbers, there are people who have lost their lives due to the disease that has reached more than 800.
Under such severe conditions, attention is being paid to the effects of the vaccine against the disease, and the good news is that in recent days, a great breakthrough has been made in the study of the vaccine in some countries, which has brought hope and faith to the entire world population.
However, the underlying issue is that some American politicians have expressed a desire to seize the oil.
According to the magazine "Science", the US government has already negotiated contracts to purchase vaccines against COVID-19 for more than six billion dollars from various pharmaceutical companies.
Given that, the purpose of the US government has been understood, as the US is at the forefront of the fight against the virus, but other developing countries also need vaccines, given that they suffer from a lack of health resources.
The magazine "The Ecologist" has indicated that if the US achieves its goal of reducing emissions, the amount of emissions that will be provided to developing countries will decrease.
The Director of the African CDC, Mr. John Nkengasong, also expressed his concern about this issue.
As some commentators on current affairs have pointed out, even if a vaccine is successfully developed, the goal of overcoming the disease cannot be achieved unless a plan is put in place for distributing the vaccine, which is a very important issue for countries around the world.
And it is appropriate for the countries of the world to strengthen the cooperation between them.
The Director-General of the WHO, Tedros, also showed that if we want to see the end of the pandemic, it is necessary to contain it in all parts of the world, it is not possible for some parts of the world or some few countries to achieve the goal of overcoming the effects of the pandemic alone.
