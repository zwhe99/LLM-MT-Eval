The great return of the Czech misfit is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL.
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The thirty-one-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the bench and could soon make it into the goal.
The former goaltender of Litvínov, Plzeň or the Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in the preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
Exactly in the middle of the game with Vegas he was substituted and since then he has not yet appeared on the NHL ice rinks.
The incident occurred at the moment when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one post to the other.
"Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with an injury to the lower body," the Denver team announced at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL goal eventually extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning American time he was called up from the farm where he had caught four duels and showed his old form.
In AHL he recorded 94.5% of the interventions.
The graduate of Plzeň hockey wants to finally make it and prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
In his last season he had problems with his hips and in the shortened pandemic season he didn't catch a single game.
In the NHL, "Francík" played 36 games, his success rate of interventions is 92.3%.
Charles puts a mask on Camille for Christmas, William and Kate pose in Jordan.
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photograph taken during their trip to Jordan as their Christmas wish this year.
Prince Charles also made his wish public, using a photo of him helping his wife Camille put on a mask at a race.
The British news station BBC informed about it on their website.
They send wishes to friends, colleagues, and foundations they collaborate with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in a desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in khaki color and Princess Charlotte has a dress too.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same shorts and collared shirt as Princes George and Louis.
Who took the photograph, William and Kate did not state, it is also not clear when exactly it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed for a photograph intended as a Christmas greeting on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their rural residence in Norfolk County.
A picture to serve as a Christmas greeting was also released by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured the races in Ascot in June.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat and a mask on his face, is helping Camille put on her mask that matches her light-colored dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbr a million for the title, but Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - In the current corruption case, investigators allegedly worked on the assumption that the accused former deputy chairman of the Czech Football Association Roman Berbr was promised one million crowns from Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
efotbal.cz server reported that he got access to part of the police files.
The Chairman of the Board of the Vršovice Club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that the Red and Whites had not committed any corrupt practices.
The server released transcripts of police wiretaps, in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar is mainly featured, who ended in the championship club last summer.
The former influential functionary of the Red and Whites was, according to the file, in frequent contact with both Berbr and the former sports director of then second-league Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
The detectives allegedly worked with the information that Slavia Berbrovi promised a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Praha team won the title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was promised a million-dollar bribe by the officials of SK Slavia Prague for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
The next day, according to the criminalists, Berbr not only met with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of Slavia Tvrdíkem.
It does not follow from the file according to the server whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík rejected any corrupt behavior.
From 2015 to 2017, we actively sought to change the dynamics of Czech football and offered an opposing alternative for its development.
"We have never committed any unlawful acts, we have not sought to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play, and we have not provided any financial payments in this regard," Tvrdík said to Seznam Zprávy.
In the recordings, among other things, Nezmar unceremoniously insults some former Slavia players of dark complexion and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing through referees was sparked last October by a police raid on several locations, including the Prague headquarters of the Czech Football Association.
The highest-ranking person in the scandal is Berbr, who no longer holds any football positions.
In mid-January, just like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks, and BVPs are LARPing Cold War.
The guns will be new, but of a generally worse type (gunners must leave the armored cabin and carry shells by hand without protection).
The cars - Toyota Hi-Lux - are new and good.
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, plus it has already been possible to get rid of Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have any (but we manufacture and export to foreign countries)
PVO: medium-cold war, outdated; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
I have a hunting ground right next to the city.
Otters were coming out of the river and causing damage to the crops, so I went there to sit.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I hoped she would leave before something came out, but of course the fox went soon.
I let her come within 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost pooped himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
By the time I got off the saddle, he was gone.
That is, the meadow can be a nuisance.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would take a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen on thermal vision, which almost everyone has today.
So put your valuable items in a visible place, at your feet in your backpack and you should be good.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Interior Ministry procured respirators much cheaper than the Ministry of Health.
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for professions closest to coronavirus, has issued billions of crowns in the past weeks for their acquisition.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that the amounts for the respirator differed by hundreds of crowns in a single day.
Why did prices fluctuate so dramatically?
Which authorities acted frugally?
And why did others shop more expensively?
Lenka Kabrhelová is speaking with the iRozhlas server editor Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and the army (I guess I'm not affected by the memories of the Czechoslovak People's Army, which the older generations experienced), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large warehouses of equipment that the recruits could take hold of, we don't actually have modern equipment even for existing professionals, moreover modern equipment is becoming increasingly complex, so the abilities of the reserves will be rapidly lost over time.
In addition to modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can be deployed, they will take place very quickly, there will be no time to retrain anyone.
Finally, reservists/territorial defense have great importance for countries like Ukraine, where it is possible to lead a mass guerrilla and it is also an expressed necessity to deter the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, fighting will only take place in a conflict of such a scale and intensity that guerrilla warfare will be irrelevant, and we do not have the appropriate geography for it.
Mostly, we don't have individual skills.
That's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them play as if they had it.
Then comes such a situation that you look like a guy who two minutes ago couldn't hit an empty goal, driving into attack alone between two or even three Swiss and you think to yourself "what do you think is going to happen now?".
Of course they will take him as an average taxpayer.
This situation with this skill "to dribble past a defender" is so terrible that I caught myself being genuinely surprised when I saw that our attacker managed to dribble past one of the opponent's players.
The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, however experts do not expect any major turnaround in the following weeks.
According to statistical models, the pressure on hospitals will last for some time and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the Omikron variant, which is likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it cannot be said with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, to what extent vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired by previous illness helps against it.
But this week, an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side has also entered the Covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new medicine, molnupiravir antiviral, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
Soon it should also be supplemented by the Pfizer drug Paxlovid, which reports a success rate of 85 percent from the current results.
The first deliveries of the coronavirus vaccine to the Czech Republic have highlighted not only the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, but also the question of how the local administration is prepared for the incoming drugs.
As was said, the first to be made available to domestic patients will be Merck's molnupiravir.
The company ended up on the tape first, also because the drug began to be developed long before the current pandemic began, with the aim of finding an appropriate treatment for viral diseases of horses on the South American continent.
These researches often overlook the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
Therefore, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to speaking "as our beak grew".
See, you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you no without hesitation.
In the West they will tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist bastards.
And then they go and vote for parties like AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this publicly means losing their job and facing a media lynching.
Then it looks good in the surveys, West good, East bad.
But they will really find out what people think.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmour both have over 20% according to the poll.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in Czech.
Due to the rotation of units, so that soldiers don't have to relearn where everything is, all objects are exactly the same.
One of them is the Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR didn't want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for security reasons or for the speed of deployment due to its western location.
In these underground shelters (there are two in each maple tree), only the heads were kept, not the entire rockets as is said.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this head and mounted it on some carrier device.
Besides the museum maple, the rest are in a deplorable state.
In the second grade of elementary school we had a classmate Gypsy, we were with him for 4 years.
He was pretty chill, made good jokes, often over-expressed himself, but he was like our mascot.
Everyone enjoyed talking to him, he often went and wanted to explain something, he was rarely absent, he went regularly, he did sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he was always neatly dressed.
He went on school trips in nature, did all sorts of mischief, but was still in good spirits, never had any trouble.
In eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies, enrolled in the same year, different classes.
Shortly after that, they beat the teacher, the police were often called to deal with something there, they threatened and intimidated other students..
Personally, I sometimes sell something on an ad (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had the money, they didn't try to pull any tricks on the price, communication was calm.
I even sold a car this way, the guy called me a month later to say he had already transferred it to himself.
I say of myself that I am not a racist, it doesn't matter to me if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as is appropriate in polite society (work, function, don't beat women, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, stretches out their hand, rents out apartments and houses, has chaos around them, causes problems... then it doesn't matter what color they are, but it will bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, as long as they integrate, start businesses, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), and respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, it's all the same to me as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachatice.
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot despite resuscitation care," Zuzana Fajtlová, spokesperson for South Bohemian health rescuers, told Právo.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was transporting the girl.
An eighteen-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was probably driving from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and for as yet unknown reasons, he veered off into the opposite lane in a bend.
After the collision with the Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot ended up on the roof off the road, described the accident the South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young driver of the Peugot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and he was trapped in the car.
After his rescue, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and in a stable state he was airlifted to the Czech Budweis hospital, stated the rescuer Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the second car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to the hospital.
For packages from countries outside the EU, new rules apply, customers often do not provide the information about them.
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly collects trading cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars up, where it's still worth importing, especially from Japan, where shipping is often free," the collector explains.
Since October, ordering small shipments has become slightly more expensive, now VAT must be added and customs information must be provided to the post office.
He will receive an email with the message that customs officials are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then just fill in the shipment details, and if the VAT was not included by the merchant at the time of sale, it will be calculated by the customs office from the total amount for the shipment and for the transport.
If the recipient does not arrange the customs procedure themselves, a fee for the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I'll tick one or two checkboxes, attach two attachments and I'm done.
For me it's usually a five-minute question, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Due to new customs regulations, the daily number of international packages received at the post office in Prague has dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to Czech Post, there is also a problem that people do not respond to requests for the data needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30,000 parcels at the international post office that we need to process.
If people filled in all the necessary information and filled it in on time, we would be roughly halfway there, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Solution to inflation
See the title, how would you suggest a solution to the current inflation?
Currently we are at 9.9% inflation and further growth is expected.
What do you think the state should do to slow or compensate for this growth?
For example, we see a reduction in VAT on food and PHM in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where this is heading?
Prices are rising faster than wages, it is inevitable in my opinion that people will not be able to afford basic things, especially energy.
How much were you given as a bonus (if you are an employee)?
They gave me a 2% raise in gross this year, which is a joke, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I run while employed.
Could someone explain to me why proven violent offenders are sent to prison for only 6 months?
My head just can't wrap around how a court can sentence such an animal to only 6 months behind bars only for them to do it again as soon as they get out.
Six months is nothing in comparison to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, negatively affecting their sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention that the victim of rape may never recover from it.
Will this also deter potential future reporting of rape victims?
The Man from the Grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The Man from the Grave unwittingly helped the guards to secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He had summoned her himself.
He went about it the long way.
First, he addressed a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
The guards, after being called on the emergency line, arrived at the scene and were amazed when the alleged "robbed" person told them that he had made it all up so that the guards would come to the scene.
In reality, he just wanted advice from the guards on how to file a report with the Czech Police.
Upon checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the guards then discovered that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant was issued for her.
The case is therefore being handled by the Czech Police.
An honest question for people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I personally believe that Slavs are no longer ethnically or culturally the same, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I obviously agree with me, it's a pity that Churchill couldn't secure the liberation of Prague by the USA :')
Of course, I don't deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can really believe something without any proof just because it could potentially bring benefit.
I wouldn't personally consider such a case to be true faith.
I cannot agree with Pascal here, there are approximately, if I'm not mistaken, around ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should a person choose?
I would say it is quite likely that among the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you harshly if you believe in a different god.
But even in the Ten Commandments it stands that there is no other god but Jehovah.
Wouldn't it be more rational in such a case to abstain from belief in any god, rather than risk choosing the wrong one out of thousands of gods and the one true god I didn't pick sending me to hell or some other similar place?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent placement in the reserves.
The Swiss model is somewhat similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If one conducts oneself well, they can get a professional offer.
Something like this would be useful for all branches of the Czech Armed Forces.
It could be done in collaboration with the Defense University.
We can talk like this: The cooperation between the educational sector and industry is constantly being discussed, companies are fishing in schools and there is some kind of interweaving, when the labor force migrates from educational institutions to employment.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Similar interweaving should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I see it as a way to build a relationship between the citizen and the army, that is, an institution that guarantees that no Russian, German or even Mongol invader will ever invade here again.
It seems funny to me how you consider NATO to be carved in stone, we have allies and they will therefore defend us if something goes wrong.
Praise the Lord.
One election in the USA that cuts their budget and the whole NATO goes to hell.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that all they need to do is turn their backs and they will take what they want.
The only thing that works long-term as a guarantor of independence is a well-armed army and a population that can control the military technology of its time.
Today, every teenager can pilot remote-controlled devices, so why not?
We don't need border fortifications, that's useless nowadays, but a resourceful teenager with a remote control device can manage.
How to drown in a box-wave tsunami
You unpack the gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are home overwhelmed with boxes and fillings?
These "wastes" are being reused by e-shops that are lacking packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of stores that will welcome your used boxes was created.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
So it is a waste to treat them as disposable.
Anyone can, by agreement, bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste created, and also avoid overcrowded blue bins.
Retailers welcome the packaging which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the saved money, since the packaging cardboard has increased by 50% in the last period.
In the eyes of environmentally conscious customers, I am also strengthening my brand.
One of such stores is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-friendly cosmetics and toiletries.
Individuals bring boxes and packing material to Popůvky near Brno when they accumulate at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular deliveries of discarded cardboard.
We will use everything when packing parcels from our e-shop.
Together, individuals and companies are creating a more respectful world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
The www.KAMsNIM.cz application also shows collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted waste from households, where to drop off expired medicines, tires, used electronics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All waste can thus end up in the right place, and reusable items can find their second home.
The project map now contains over 100,000 such places.
"Gradually, collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find a use for things that would otherwise become waste unnecessarily are being added to it," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliďme Česko association.
I find it worse that in today's age technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use computers or phones to play games don't learn basic computer skills.
Recently, a problem has arisen (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the concept of computer folders.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple Photos or, actually, mobile phones in general, simply hide the underlying file system with folders and throw everything onto one screen in the app.
Let them use technology from childhood, but mainly let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency - starting in January - over the weekend and it was grand.
Macron spoke for an hour, during which he revealed the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many actions that they cannot be completed in half a year.
French politicians like it and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters straddling the right and left agree on little, but on Europe, yes.
And in France there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader also mentioned that historians should write "a single history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators rushed to criticize that Macron's aim is pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In reality, it is more about preventing the rewriting of history.
The far-right presidential candidate in France, Éric Zemmour, is currently touring the country with the argument that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad and is having quite a bit of success with the French people.
Let's take Macron's idea of a single history textbook seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story of us versus them and never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, French, and Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened teacher, they won't find out what the wider context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, also won awards for direction and for best actress Jasna Duričičovou.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Festival, he held the top spots in the audience rankings.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being under the weather". I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't have much of a desire to smoke...
It was worse than a regular flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(This is only my personal experience. I'm not saying that everyone has this experience.)

We are attaching additional books to this digital edition for you, subscribers, so that you have enough time to purchase books as Christmas gifts.
Prose texts that follow the previous similar collection of Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another portion of observation of the world and description of everyday things with an extraordinary poetic attentiveness, depth, and atmosphere.
In his second novel, photographer Šesták attempted to capture the essence of a small town and Czech society.
A tale of a return to one's roots, which turns out to be just a longed-for illusion.
The Bohemian and Comparative Studies scholar is transferring the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood to the backdrop of a contemporary village.
Her rendition surpasses the folk versions with its brutality and culminates in a horror of emotional emptiness.
And that the path back to instincts is shorter than one is willing to admit
In his penultimate novel, the author tells a much less sentimental story about returning from emigration than we are used to hearing.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make a life together.
Trains are starting to run according to the new timetable, some will change operators.
Starting from Sunday, trains will be running according to the new timetable on the railway.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some routes, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet is starting to run instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, possibly with a slight change in their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The transport companies already started selling tickets during the autumn.
Czech Railways plan to operate an average of 6783 passenger services daily in the new timetable, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains daily.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers under the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections within the new timetable, the railways will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will deploy dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be the InterJet trains, which will run on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
The carrier will dispatch more new trains in Northern Moravia or in Western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase the fare prices from next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
Railways take inflation into account in their tariffs annually.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry into the R23 line from Ústí nad Labem to Mělník, Nymburk and Kolín.
The carrier will replace Czech Railways here after success in the Ministry of Transport competition.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 services on the route daily, eight in each direction.
Further changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to maintain the most similar timetable of its long-distance trains despite the planned maintenance work.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
The carrier will also be changed in some regional routes.
Changes await travelers, for example in Českolipsko, where instead of Czech Railways, Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the route from Mladá Boleslav to Rumburk via Česká Lípa.
Passengers will be able to use a unified fare on the railway for the second year as well.
Just like with Czech Railways, their price will increase by 3.2 percent inflation.
I must disagree.
Aren't we supposed to learn to see things from the other side?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work hard, dying.
In my life, I have never heard a lesson from the perspective of the slave-owners or from that time, nobody defends this, only condemns it.
No one will tell you in schools that black people often sold each other into slavery and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one in school will teach you that colonizers often bought land from the Indians, they will only tell you how brutally we Europeans massacred them, while they had been massacring each other for a long time.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly in schools, both in northern schools and in southern ones.
I haven't encountered anyone deliberately omitting facts, but I have heard before that it happens and in my opinion it is a problem, I don't deny that (for example in Japan, the atrocities of WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History is not interested in someone's feelings, it is simply what it is and I think it is a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at the matter from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, when we're talking about the Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and famous slave owners are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also had some of their own successes and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
Furthermore, the North was not much better than it is idealized by many people today.
A lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slave owner and a lot of things were also opposed to them.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit certain facts, lie and manipulate, plus our perspective doesn't even exist there (on YouTube there was even a video from the television where they cut off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What seemed ridiculous to me in US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I found that at some universities it was awful, the students were quite radicalized and the schools often supported them in that.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, I feel a bit sick from the thought that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is among the young and in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has already achieved what it was supposed to and it's no longer about the same thing, it has become radicalized.
Currently, those who have nothing to do with feminism are labeled as feminists and ignore basic biological facts, as well as other groups such as LGBT, leading to radicalization on both sides, often leading to resistance even to quite reasonable things.
Furthermore, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
In any case, in the end, I also haven't encountered anyone who would condemn me for colonialism or slavery.
I guess I just had a bad geography lesson, but it was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because it's completely pointless to me.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
Furthermore, I consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary in terms of any personal identity.
If something connects me to people, it's interests, views on the world, and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
This Slovak pastor is a really great guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always says something stupid about the coronavirus that makes everyone embarrassed.
Of course, there is also the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born from Catholic modernity and are effectively Catholics without a Pope.
I know many people who are Catholic but attend services with the Hussites because it is theologically very similar, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, St. Michael's Church on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there they hold a mass in Latin every Sunday at 3:00 PM, as it was done before Vatican II.
The Bethlehem flame is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it from Austria.
Břeclav - The Flame lit in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the scouts did not go to Vienna this time either, but in the morning they received it from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing.
They also took it over at the border last year.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in with the troop every year, I'm really looking forward to it.
It is an honor for me to be chosen, said scout Amálie Budíková to the present journalists.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal-Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, though, the scouts take the train to Vienna.
Nothing changes in the distribution of the flame across the Czech Republic.
With the Bethlehem light, the scouts traditionally set off by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
The subsequent distribution of light will be taken care of by scout couriers on Saturday, December 18th, who will travel by selected express and personal trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take the light from them at the stations and then spread the flame further throughout the Czech Republic, even to places where the railway does not go.
This year, scouts must adhere to the current measures against the spread of coronavirus.
It's going the same as last year.
We recommend both courier teams and local event organizers to wear masks, maintain social distancing, keep the number of people as low as possible, not to sing together, and generally behave in the safest way possible, said Zuzana Hrbková, spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of the Bethlehem Light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship, and harmony alongside the flame.
The Bethlehem Light is a symbol of hope and light for believers that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The action stands on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human mutuality.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for a flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I do not have an economic education, so I do not know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I do not think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education will properly utilize the money, I just don't understand why the money is being put into agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - an unnecessary product is produced and it disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work in a factory where there are millions of posters on the corridors saying "xy funded/co-funded by the xy project" and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not support for a company that provides jobs for x people, this is a hindrance to development when this company barely holds on and takes orders/employees away from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Absolute agreement, it's horrible.
Even someone born in the internet age can sometimes get caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I thought internet ads wouldn't affect me, but then I find myself influenced by them - it's so sophisticated that one can't always resist it.
Therefore, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament that currently want to impose a complete ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all crap, in the words of a classic - I would ban the internet.
I feel that this faith has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
I won't believe something that the majority believes and makes sense, I'm not a sheep after all, but rather I will believe something that is less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it is important that I will have my own original opinion which I will claim is critical thinking.
"I won't believe everything the media says"
"I don't trust politicians."
Television has fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, with two hundred premieres this year.
Los Angeles - China, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have succumbed to the trend of Christmas movies and this year they will present a record of more than two hundred premieres to their viewers.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb movie database.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic movies has been scoring well with audiences in recent years and significantly increasing viewership, so more and more of these films are being made.
This year, four times more Christmas movies were filmed than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so there will be many more festive films in reality.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is mainly associated with fairy tales, while globally popular films such as Home Alone, Heavenly Love or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular.
The real boom of Christmas movies only started in 2009, when the American cable television channel Hallmark came with a special film series, according to the BBC server.
Her Advent project titled Countdown to Christmas included four movies and was very successful.
This station began tuning its viewers for Christmas as early as October 22nd and will present a total of 42 Christmas movies.
The competing station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on its program this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are contributing to the total.
"In this magical period, the story doesn't matter so much, what's important is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of the book I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, humorously described this genre.
"For viewers, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a bit of peace for at least two hours amidst all the holiday madness and the madness of the world we've been living in for the past few years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV uses the same recipe for its movies, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then about half an hour before the end there is some misunderstanding which is successfully resolved and the two of them kiss.
It's always the same, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after the other, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive test for Covid-19 and will not take part in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive test for Covid-19 and will not take part in the last race of the season.
Haas stable will only send one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was aiming for a better finish than the 20th place he had earned in qualifying.
However, Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will not take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He had tested positive for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, with Mick Schumacher from Mazepin's team starting from the last position and Max Verstappen from the first, who will compete directly with Lewis Hamilton for the title.
According to the statement of the Haas team, Mazepin is relatively in good condition and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically okay because he was asymptomatic.
He is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all parties involved," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not and cannot send a replacement driver to the race.
Any substitute would have to qualify or race in another part of the weekend.
The first racer is not dealing with COVID-19.
At the start of the just-ending season, Kimi Räikkönen had Covid-19, while last year Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton were tested positive.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze you!
It's kind of like a portable jewelry store and the creator put in half a year of work and all of his savings.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never really worn at home," admits Liban, who spent 3000 hours on his work in half a year.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-carat gold thread in France and 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski company.
He then decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk will give the sweater softness," praises the creator of his work, which however does not recommend washing.
But there's still one catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If successful, it will create a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago was "only" 720,000 crowns.

The government approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to assist Poland.
Engineers, scouts, and drone pilots could set out before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are helping their Polish colleagues with protecting the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.

British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Is the Omikron mutation spreading in Southern Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
"We currently have another suspicion of this variant reported for another child from Adam's, from the preparatory class.
"No direct contact with previous cases from Adamov Elementary School has been proven," Ciupek stated.
Six cases have appeared in the region this week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," the director said.
She added that there were two nurses from one workplace of the Brno Faculty Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old students from the Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms according to the director, four have an asymptomatic course.
Nobody with suspicion of Omikron traveled abroad.
None of the mentioned have traveled abroad, nor has anyone from their families, nor has there been any contact with anyone who has been staying abroad.
None of the mentioned have any connection to the water polo championship, Ciupek stated.

California will limit the sale of firearms.
He wants to proceed like Texas with the ban on abortions.
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to impose a ban on the sale and production of certain firearms in the most populous US state using a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions performed after the detection of a fetal heartbeat.
People should then be entitled to compensation in a lawsuit against anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement responded to the Friday statement of the US Supreme Court, which left the Texas abortion ban in effect, despite it being contrary to the nearly 50-year-old precedent ruling, which established the right to abortion nationwide in the US up to approximately the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court did not now decide on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measures.
Enforcement of the ban was in this case transferred to the public, thus disabling Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual legal route.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, which allowed the preservation of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas's maneuver to protect its law," said the Governor of California.
"If states can now block review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He reportedly tasked his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the Minister of Justice on measures that would empower the public representative to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
These are the terms used to describe homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) in compensation and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes, or sells assault rifles, ghost gun parts, or kits for their manufacture in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that is exactly what we should do," said the California governor.
The AP agency notes that California has been banning the production and sale of certain military-style weapons for a decade, but in June a federal judge here blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to now reinstate the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in her dissenting opinion to Friday's majority verdict warned against the expansion of this legal mechanism to other American states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant Texas' abortion ban full immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue their lawsuits against selected officials of the southern US state.
Every emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, where gradually it is determined how the vaccination scheme will look like and also improvements are made to the vaccines themselves, based on the results.
Studies on the effects of four doses are already rolling in from Israel.
According to these studies, there is up to a fivefold increase in antibodies in most patients, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule in due time, it's just too early for that right now.
Another fact is that soon a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, should come to the market according to the manufacturer's specifications, promising up to 10 times greater effectiveness.

Poland threatened to stop payments into the EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would act in violation of the law if it used its new powers and suspended payments to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan for the use of 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism allowing for the removal of EU funding from countries violating the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU with a veto in all matters requiring unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small party Solidarity Poland, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments to the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be excusable given that the EU is unlawfully denying us funds from the common budget to which we also contribute, added the Polish minister.
His party takes a more radical stance towards the EU than the ruling party, Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish justice system has undergone during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is setting "impossible conditions because its goal is not a legal state, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw is facing "a political dictate carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of an EU based on a partnership of sovereign states, not on the rule of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions from Brussels that would limit the sovereignty of Poland.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony," he declared.
But to figure it out... At our Lidl they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I wasn't looking at the other things, I had seen yogurt multiple times too, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I gave up and asked.
They had it, that's true, in that narrow sector all the selected, less common and special cheeses were there, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If I have to avoid the supermarket, whether there's a sale or not, the golden shop on the square doesn't have such a wide selection, but usually they have everything I need and it's organized, so I'm done in ten minutes.
Going to Lidl to take a vacation.
I don't care anymore.
For two years I have been watching how data is handled here like manure, most of the opponents of vaccination are just a little bit more off the mark than most of the supporters of vaccination.
Rational discussion is taking place at an expert level, but only extreme opinions are entering the public space.
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Ban everything, allow everything.
Colorful pies instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples to pears.
This state has it this way and we have it this way.
But that the data collection methodology is different in those two countries is not being addressed.
Phew, that was a relief.
Sorry for the outburst and wish you all a nice day.
They punished me with a spoon when I was a child.
It was never about grades, mostly it was just because I kept refusing to listen and misbehaving (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, mom always threatened first that if I did it again, I would get a hit (sometimes even after the next "catch" she just brought the spoon and put it so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I get a few spanks on the bottom (over clothing).
Personally, I think physical punishments (in reasonable execution and measure) are beneficial because a child responds to them much more than to words.
In my opinion, the most important part is the warning, because it gives the child a choice whether to disobey and get punished, or to improve and avoid the punishment.
In the end, a warning was usually enough for me to start listening.
System Defense
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution meant to him - whether it was a sacred document to which one swore and was taught from childhood, or rather an agreement that could be changed if necessary - he definitely leaned towards the first interpretation.
Once we agreed in the institution on the democratic rules of our life, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to be careful with changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just like Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl commented on the question at the time.
Recently, however, the opinion that the Czech Constitution needs to be changed is becoming increasingly common among lawyers.
Léta is tested by situations its creators (among them Vojtěch Cepl) could not predict, such as the behavior of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions into their texts must be thought out.
The institution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies have faced throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of governance order consisting of individual rules that set the boundaries of the game for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind policies with prohibitions.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
COVID does not discriminate, at FN Brno several months old baby is fighting for life.
Although it is known that coronavirus is usually milder in children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are less threatened and affected than adults, we talk about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation of the Faculty Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, to Novinky.
The course is usually much simpler, lighter, often without symptoms.
There are however children patients who are severely ill with coronavirus, which we can see especially in the last period," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
This takes place at a pediatric infectious disease clinic.
Seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently in the ICU.
The children with post-COVID syndromes were on the ward according to the doctor continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute Covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia that requires a stay in the intensive care unit," he said, adding that this disease affects not only adults but also adolescents and several-month-old babies.
There are also children in critical condition due to coronavirus in hospitals.
"Currently, we have children of several months and adolescent age lying here," said the head physician.
However, he is pleased that no child deaths due to the coronavirus have been recorded at the FN Brno Children's Hospital so far.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 have died in the Czech Republic as of December 6.
According to Dominik, a psychologist is an integral part of cooperation in the children's hospital - not only in the coronavirus department.
It also warns that, like adults, vaccination in children alleviates the course of the disease and simultaneously reduces the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
"Therefore, we recommend the vaccine dose application even for children," added the doctor.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on the marked paths.
But the calm zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
Generally, in national parks outside the quiet zone, you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the game reserve).
Skiing/biking in the forest outside of marked trails is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exemption (but of course it is not monitored that much outside of national parks).
How does a conductor exercise?
Music is playing in my head, Joseph Kurfiřt is laughing.
He was weaned on the Liberec opera and originally played the horn.
As a singer, he can practically sing any repertoire and as a conductor he works not only in the Liberec F. Šalda Theatre, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
He collaborates with the Hradec Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic, or the Podkrkonoš Symphony Orchestra.
China is creating the impression of having the outbreak under control and that its authoritarian regime is better equipped to handle the crisis.
Sinologist Jirouš: China is creating the impression of having the outbreak under control and that the authoritarian regime is dealing with the crisis better.
China has launched a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was facing criticism for failing to contain the virus that has now become a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero increase in infections.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus in many places, including the worst-hit Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is this a friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him: Hey, do you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
The wife is happy because he mows the grass, washes the car with a hose, and the children play with him.
Simply awesome.
If you want, I'll sell you the elephant for 5000.
Friend: Alright, let's do it, it'll be great...
After some time they meet again and the one who bought complains: what the heck, what did you sell me for an elephant????
The lawn is trampled, giant poop everywhere, the car is broken down, the kids are scared of it and the wife wants to get a divorce.
He who sold it says: you speak badly of the elephant, you won't sell the elephant like this...
World affairs are controlled by powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states is valid, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a superpower if it works on its integration.
It currently works at the economic and political level (in selected issues), but military integration is still missing.
Personally, I think Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15, or 20 years.
But maybe by the mid-century the mood will be different and it will be successful.
That occurred to me too and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm just playing with words.
I just infer that an ellipse usually encompasses two different units at the same level.
I will take an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and tangerines", where it is clear that both are from Spain, whereas in "Spanish fruit and tangerines" it is not clear that the tangerines are from Spain.
Furthermore, I base it on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces" including their weapons and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in that broad term and there is no need to further specify it for American forces.
But again, maybe just wordplay :D
Whether it is this way or that way, it is an unreasonable demand.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured capuchin monkey Milly.
The terrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowers in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushes it and laughs at it.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebab and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The Magistrate Court in Gwent has now banned her from keeping animals for life, according to The Sun newspaper.
Experts in primate rehabilitation, who are taking care of Milly after her abuse, declared that they had never seen a marmoset so scared.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation at the Monkey World workers in Dorset and now she is happily playing again with another rescued monkey named Moon.
A quadruple mother pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the Magistrates' Court in Gwent, she was given a twelve-week custodial sentence suspended for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, given a lifetime ban on keeping animals, and must pay a total of 12,000 crowns in court costs.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team, which rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is okay, but the rehabilitation will continue."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She hunched and hid from everyone she met and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Now, after she has settled and is content with her mate, the sight of new people can still evoke panic in her.
The psychological scars from the abuse will stay with her forever, adds Sawyer.
The abuse of Milly came to light after police in Gwent discovered horrific footage on her phone after raiding her apartment on drug charges.
In the shots you can hear Milly swearing vulgarly.
In the next video, Holland can be heard offering cocaine to the monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to possessing cocaine with the intention of selling it.
Cocaine worth 1600 pounds (approximately 50 thousand crowns) was found hidden in Kinder eggs in her house.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from the prehistoric times three times in a row when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Are you taking the same things to freshman year as you did in sixth grade?
And all of this kills the idea of rote learning, where nobody, with exceptions, cares if you know it or understand it.
Mainly write the test on 1 and then nobody cares anymore.
Go out and randomly ask people on the street if they can determine the character of the roots of a quadratic equation and its coefficients.
Everyone has gone through it, and the absolute majority won't even blink and tell you they don't give a damn.
So what the hell are we learning?
I am a big fan of general overviews and the fact is that people don't want and don't need them.
At that moment it's pointless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
It is partially learned for the multitude of people who will need it.
But like, I was totally serious with that comment that you don't really need all this standing at the machine... ...because you just don't need it.
Furthermore, we are slowly entering an era where not knowing is a sign of being cool.
However, the price of having barbarians standing at our machines is simply too high, which is probably due to our communist past and the persecution of educated people and elites.
If journalists were able to count, then the Covid probably would never have reached these proportions here.

"What is the main reason why Switzerland can't leave right away," Andrea answered on Instagram in Stories to the nosy questions of curious fans, what disappointed her so much about Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
There was tension between Kadri and Andrea from the start of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move there, at least until they returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
She resolutely refused it.
And as it can be seen, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! Kadri angrily reacted to Andreino's accusation of lying, gambling and debts.
Kadri's alleged honesty now didn't even please his younger sister Linda, not to mention his ex-wife.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally, I don't express myself about these kinds of things and we never really talked about them much in my family.
I definitely don't want to evoke any pity.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and defame someone I love so much, it just won't do!
I'm sorry I have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for becoming a character and helping our family when we needed it the most, despite his young age.
All the more I'm sorry when I have to read such false information, which are probably taken out of context.
I would really wish for everyone to know Kadri like I, our close ones and family do, stands in declaration in response to Andrea's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the truth and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunk thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what it's for.
Chao launched his robbery expedition in the parking lot of a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he finally stole approximately 330 crowns from one vehicle.
Then he couldn't think of anything better than to climb up to the 5th floor and climb into the apartment through the open window.
He stole two bananas there.
The security camera footage then captures him walking away from the scene of the crime while eating a banana.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he noticed that the bananas were not where they were supposed to be and he called the police.
She then arrested Cchaa.
The man admitted that he had consumed alcohol on the incriminating day.
And due to the fact that he needed money, he decided to rob in a drunken state.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed up the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Law is time-limited and its effectiveness is tied to a state of pandemic readiness.
When that is repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law restricts the scope of business
Is that not enough of a reason for you?
The right to assemble will be restricted, but not abolished.
Over 60 percent of voters came to the Saturday elections for the four municipalities.
On Saturday, people elected new councils in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradiště, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec, and Rovné in Pelhřimov.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the number prescribed by law or the elected councils have dissolved.
A total of 99 candidates competed for 28 mandates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a relatively demanding but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies were held in it, said Deputy Chairwoman of the Czech Statistical Office Eva Krumpová.
She reminded that due to the Covid-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security.
In Komna in Uherskohradiště, the Saturday elections were won by the Association of Independent Candidates, which received 27.76 percent of the votes and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate list received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means the gain of two mandates.
Two seats in the council were also won by Citizens for Komňa, 18.52 percent of voters gave them their vote.
Again, the former mayor of the municipality, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Privateers, was elected to the council.
The Komanes – independent candidates achieved one mandate in the legislature.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
The Pro Rovnou association won in the village of Rovná in Pelhřimov region.
It received 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were still elected to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeat elections in Lužice in Mostecku were again won by the Lužice and Svinčice Association led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It received 56.73 percent of the votes and, like in 2018, it has four mandates in the seven-member council.
The second-place candidate, the People's Community, received 43.27 percent of the vote, so they will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters came to the polls.
The elections in Nová Ves in Liberec were won by the independent candidates of Naděje pro Novou Ves ahead of the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the association of independent candidates, resulting in four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
YES received 40.12 percent of the votes and strengthened against regular elections in 2018, gained one more mandate and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the election results.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be the bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you already know all of this that people are writing here.
You're just playing dumb so you can have someone to "argue" with.
If not, then it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was, after all, the goal, to look good).
And I really don't care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I am bothered by how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it accumulated, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it caused, such as the Thirty Years' War
TL;DR: Believe in a spaghetti monster if you want, but state and church have nothing to do with each other.
The man fell head first from twelve meters.
He survived the impact on concrete.
An incredible fall was survived on Sunday night by a man in Ostrava, for whom the rescuers of the Regional Medical Rescue Service intervened.
Employees of the regional operations center received an emergency call at one o'clock after midnight with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two crews from the Fire and Rescue Service immediately arrived at the scene - medical and health.
Upon arrival at the scene, the medical staff determined that the 27-year-old man had fallen from a window approximately twelve meters high and had landed headfirst on the concrete!
Coal was mined in Vítkovice.
But not as it should, and the firefighters went into action.
Upon the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate danger of life.
The attending physician intubated his airways, secured artificial lung ventilation, and after other measures within the pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to the further care of the Ostrava Trauma Center, informed the spokesman of the ZZS MS region, Lukáš Humpl.
I have greater concerns than the coronavirus from the inadequate reactions of the public and authorities.
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but it is mainly doctors and health personnel who are in the front line of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?
We are asking military doctor David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA experienced an amazing gala evening full of interesting results.
Things were happening at the UFC 269 tournament.
Outsider Julianna Peňová was able to defeat legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who had not found a conqueror for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in the lightweight division, he put on a great choke against Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept Cody Garbrandt with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise that nobody expected.
This brought a women's bantamweight fight between the renowned Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pena.
The American entered the mutual battle as a proverbial "dwarf", Nunes had not lost for seven years and was sharpening her teeth for another triumph.
The beginning of the duel was also in line with the paper expectations.
Nunes started her journey to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick, sending her to the ground.
However, Penov refused to be forced into any further mistakes and attempted to attack with a lever on her arm unsuccessfully.
The second round was thrilling and very suspenseful for MMA fans.
Both opponents exchanged a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
The extra money Nunes got landed her on the ground, where she started to choke.
She had to give up the effort and abandon the attack.
The American gave everyone a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
Initially, Poirier was doing better, but the tide gradually began to turn.
In the second one, Oliveira tried to be more active, trying to overpower his opponent with an arm bar.
He didn't have much success at first, but then he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and bombarded him with a series of strikes.
He won the second round because of that.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke to which Poirier resisted for a while, but eventually had to tap out.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley secured a resounding victory, landing a hard right back on Rauliana Paiva in the first round.
Subsequently, he knocked him out with a series of precisely aimed blows and recorded his fifteenth victory.
Kara-France was then able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
Seven years ago, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, but now she has lost.
Is it this knee or that knee?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so there is no problem determining whether it is masculine, feminine or neuter.
But there is also a relatively large group of nouns for which the gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When declining, they acquire two endings and in some cases remain in the inflected form.
For example, the words "svízel" and "kyčel" are of both masculine and feminine gender, in the first one they are declined according to the pattern "stroj", in the second one according to the pattern "píseň".
For the next group of nouns, there are different forms in the first case of the singular, for example: "řádek/řádka", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "brambor/brambora" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are correct, they have the same meaning, and are therefore interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, in this case the Moravian variant is ungrammatical, similarly with other Czech-Moravian word pairs: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih" etc.
Some words that have entered the Czech language from other languages were originally inflected, but gradually they are adopting Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image", which is of both masculine and feminine gender, or the word "buffet", which remained in the neuter gender, but in the masculine it has endings according to the pattern "castle".
Turkey opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like at the Greek borders?
Tension is mounting on the Greek-Turkish border due to the increasing number of migrants attempting to move further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to head to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped blocking them.
European politicians are promising Greece support, the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to take the uncertain journey?
What does the situation look like on the ground?
We hadn't seen a blue sky in three months and we were suffocating, describes a journalist from Sydney.
The devastating bushfires that Australia has been dealing with for the past four months have killed nearly thirty people and hundreds of millions of animals, and have destroyed millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the people themselves coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic impacts, as critics claim?
What will the country have to prepare for in the future in relation to climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová is speaking with the journalist from Sydney, Ikou Detrichovou.
False accusations have always been and are still quite rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
People find it unpleasant to address how sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to hush it up.
I don't personally know anyone who has been falsely accused.
I know many people who have been raped and I have experienced how their environment or even the police often treat them.
Victims should always be believed.
The trend has become that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But still too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are also those who falsely accuse someone.
It is disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the accusations are made up" and that it is a "trend" you are only helping sexual assailants.
Czech Republic is flooded with unfinished houses, families don't have money to finish them.
The prices of building materials have increased by more than 30 percent in the last weeks and months.
A lot of people got into a difficult situation because of it.
She does not have the means to complete the unfinished family homes and banks are refusing to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to the cost of materials, the cost of construction work is also increasing.
People therefore do not have enough money to finish already partially constructed family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase mortgage loans, creating extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move into unfinished and unapproved houses.
In the worst case, the unfinished houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and rent at the same time," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We will build two to three family houses within a year and fifty percent of it has been accomplished.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to adhere to certain things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
"So we're doing it without a profit," said Zdeněk Slivoň, the owner of the construction company.
Many people will only have financial problems.
If they had counted on the house construction costing five million, now it will cost seven.
"I think some will be waiting," added Slivoň.
Copper, iron, and plumbing and heating equipment have increased the most in price from the material.
Construction companies are also struggling with a shortage of labor.
In the Czech Republic, there is a shortage of graduates in construction fields and the influx of foreign workers is being hindered by the pandemic.
The situation regarding the issuance of building permits is currently the most favorable.
"The building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than last year," Křeček specified.
We are doing well and we will do even better.
Real vision is missing, says the commentator of ČRO - mujRozhlas.
In addition to the traditional celebrations, the entry into the new year was also traditionally accompanied by speeches from politicians.
This year, in addition to Prime Minister and ANO leader Andrej Babiš and President Miloš Zeman's Christmas message, the nation was addressed by the chairmen of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
What have we learned fundamentally?
I think the diploma thesis is great, I have my own topic that I chose, I'm building on my bachelor's thesis, I always work on it for a whole year and then I write the written part in a week or two.
State exams are completely calm here, unless the person is a total monkey and something stayed in their head, then the commission won't unnecessarily suffocate them with theory.
I, for example, studied for the state exam for a week and when I was at the end of my rope, the committee always tried to guide me to some logical deduction, which I immediately understood and I had it right.
Otherwise, for those projects, I know people who pay someone to do their semester project for them (we did it a lot, really beneficial, learned a lot) and then just learn the project and they're done.
In my opinion, it's great when at the end of the subject there is a test that projects the knowledge gained within the project, not just a defense.
Everything is okay but don't overwhelm emails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You will be just as much of a jerk as they are.
Those people at the embassy don't have to have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would be taking a lot of risks, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can certainly put a similar statue of Putin next to the Teddy Bear statue.
Maybe give it to her so that it reaches Xi Jinping's backside or something like that.
I agree, even though Insta throws obstacles in the way of artists.
If you don't post stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will be reduced to a minimum.
Furthermore, it keeps changing which function is more important, whether it's a like, comment, or save.
I'm really getting fed up with it lately, so I might have to resort to TikTok, where a lot of artists from my industry have been successful and can't seem to get enough of it.
Finally, I would even be happy if something more user-friendly came along that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of the artists.
Declaration of the Working Party of Donbas
Union - yes, breakup - no, opponents of the breakup of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal dissolution of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history occurred.
On December 8, 1991, in the Belovezhskaya Forest, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk, and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, secretly and without regard for the people, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist" with Mikhail S. Gorbachev's open indulgent attitude.
With one stroke of the pen, they "abolished" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Regardless of the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in both world wars combined!
The same people who destroyed in one sitting what had been built in the previous seventy years in the Belovezhskaya Pushcha forest betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, slowed down agriculture, and detached fourteen republics that had previously been economically connected in a single mechanism from the world's greatest power.
If we look even deeper, we see impoverishment of the population, disintegration of the economy, science, army, increase in criminality, inter-ethnic conflicts, war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, expansion of NATO to the east, war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, Arab Spring, war in Syria - all this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as "power vacuum".
Everything that was hastily abandoned and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
The whole world is still shaken mainly due to the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a high-turnover supermarket does not necessarily correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I will buy it with the intention of putting it in the fridge and making dinner out of it on Thursday.
In an alternative reality where I don't buy the meat on Monday, the chain store discounts it to 99 Kč/kg on Tuesday - can you describe the mechanism by which this change in the price of the meat becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or I could wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 Kč/kg one day before the expiration date - how would this meat differ from the one I bought on Monday for 120 Kč more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - I'm destroying it.
These talks about how if something is cheap, it must be definitely bad, spoiled or of poor quality are really retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Recently I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the girls were handing out some brochure, I always take similar things to help the volunteers, they can't throw it away...
No, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nothing about God, I was confused, but I suspected it would be some kind of propaganda.
After reading, I found out who published it and eventually it turned out to be Scientology.
No, like it was a good old-fashioned stuff, full of completely unnecessary lessons, like I should wash and not be naughty.
What a waste of paper, forests wouldn't have to be cut down for this.
I experienced something similar with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with that person because you love them without realizing how messed up the situation is.
She threatened me several times that she would hurt herself because I went out to chat with a friend she didn't like.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she started to cry and begged me on her knees not to go anywhere.
Then she began to physically block the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another half year passed and it started to go downhill.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her that we were breaking up and lying to her that we could still talk about it next week to calm her down and to prevent her from going into a rage.
Such a person will suck out of you cities, emotions, and overall joy.
Better to keep your distance
When insurance companies here are frantically looting the purchase of cloud tests and rushing to the positive ones who would not have known about this terrible disease without the test.
The only thing we achieve is complications for companies, carriers and others, due to the fact that their employees in the random number generator got five days of home detention.
Out West they have stopped with the clowning around and acknowledged that it is not worth trying to solve a sickness weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and he still needs to steal something and boost his ego by inventing some nonsense.
I see that our old friend the scoundrel is back again.
After several years of suppression and suppression of this shady business, MLM recruiting is back in the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at university), the initial promises of product training and sales skills quickly shifted to "you don't need to worry about that, just get people".
Honestly, I was interested in the products I was offering because I wanted to help people, however, the training was more about scaring and coercing people.
When the first earned money came, people quickly realized that if they wanted to earn money, they had to sell a few certain products each month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only sources of income, so one felt like a door-to-door salesman of pots.
What I can say though is that it was a valuable experience, one learns not to jump on every opportunity and to thoroughly verify the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump everyone together.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" bank account.
In the corporation where I work, I haven't experienced many of these things.
HR is at peace, managers are looking after their management and they don't stick their noses into anything.
So regular evaluation is somehow happening, in the form it is running here it is quite going (set some goals for the next year, look at what worked and what didn't in a year) - it is more self-evaluation than someone evaluating you according to some numbers, and so on.
Company events are also optional.
But we are also somewhat unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes one has the feeling that we are almost like a startup, squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works so they don't bother us much as long as the results are there.
The Czech missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, British police have been searching unsuccessfully for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12th, the outgoing Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that a woman from Uherskohradištsko had been found dead.
The British police unfortunately confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that they have found the body of the missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With respect to the family, we will not be providing more information about the case.
Kulhánek expressed sincere condolences on Twitter.
The last time the young woman was seen was on November 28th in the bus on her way home from work, she was supposed to pick up money from the ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by her colleagues at work five days later.
Subsequently, London police began searching for her, Interpol listed her as missing worldwide.
She also appeared in the Czech missing persons database.
In this context, the police have already arrested a man a few days ago.
What role was he supposed to play in the case and what is he suspected of, but not revealed.
At the end of the year, new councils were elected in four towns.
On Saturday, December 11th, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradiště, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec and Rovná in Pelhřimov.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the number prescribed by law or the elected councils have dissolved.
99 valid candidates competed for 28 mandates in the new elections.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were elected.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections to the councils in the four municipalities mentioned.
36 women and 63 men were competing for 28 representative posts.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest was 72 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a relatively demanding but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place in it.
We had to mostly work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which posed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, evaluated Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last polling station was processed on Sunday, December 12th at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, after approval, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a fairly dangerous infectious disease, but it went without much trouble.
I still have a problem dealing with how stupidly a large part of the population at all its levels approaches this.
I'm most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not jerks.
He would be removed from the office of president and the ability to regain it.
The chance that it will really happen is, as others here mention, very small.
Furthermore, I'm not sure if the destruction of the file could be considered treason.
High treason is an act by which the president of the republic endangers the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who have gone without sex for a whole year is increasing.
More and more young adults in the USA are living their lives without sex.
It mainly concerns religiously motivated people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who abstain from sexual activity increased from 8 to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who reported not having had sexual intercourse in the last year are more than ever before.
Other factors also contribute to the decrease in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them can be the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
The presence of media, social networks, or video games could also contribute, which make sex a lower and lower priority for young people.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who report not having had sex in the previous year has been rapidly increasing," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Among married people, sexual activity is more frequent; for 2021 only 5% of them reported that they had been without sex for the last year.
Among free people it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious beliefs also contribute to the decrease in sexual activity.
Although there is a greater likelihood that married couples will be sexually active, the percentage of married people under 35 is still decreasing.
Young people's opinion on premarital sex is divided, about 30% think it is a bad thing, while about 70% think it is okay.
"It is true that among free individuals in this age group they are a minority, but their behavior is pushing this trend," Stone speaks of these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, among free people under 35 years old who attend religious gatherings more than once a month, the rate of abstinence has increased from 20 to almost 60%.
"Among the 'less religious', the trend has risen from 10 to 20%," declared Stone.
Other factors such as less social interaction and mainly social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic also contribute to the decrease in sexual activities.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is lower for people without work or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, thus replacing this need.
This trend has taken hold mainly during the lockdown period of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole vaccination mandate against Covid is about whether society should force a portion of the population to behave in a way they don't want to, but which could save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, which I personally am most interested in the question of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether it will be our fault if we don't order it and they die.
My argument is that we could certainly be held responsible for the death of an eighty-year-old person who really didn't know much, we didn't explain it well to him, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he refused to get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the death of a staunch anti-vaccinationist who is here shouting something about bullying and totalitarian state alongside the SPD and the Communist Party.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be clearly inferred that most of the unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will really be able to do it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will the mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times to the Czech Republic.
Ski resort operators cannot do without technical snow, and the weather can complicate even the preparation of the Jizerská Padesátka cross-country skiing race.
Is this a trend or an exception?
What will a lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it's not about a religious person.
Once in high school, our teacher took us all over the city to the boatyard so we could go boating on the river.
On the way there, we went down a quite wide street and who do we see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they descended upon us.
Fortunately, I escaped, but one of my friends got into a conversation.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she had said to them.
They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I don't have a soul," she replied.
We all, including the teacher, were laughing the whole way to the boat dock.
We are terribly spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovič.
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki welcomed him with military honors.
"We are opening a new chapter in our mutual relations," Morawiecki said at the joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must make it clear together that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
Chancellor Merkel believes it is advisable to resolve the crisis, caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, through diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normandy Group" comprising France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that he had informed the Chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially created a migration crisis and is using people as living targets and weapons, because every night we record hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He negotiated with the Chancellor about further sanctions in order for Lukashenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin to finally understand that we are determined to defend the Eastern border of the EU.
According to the DPA agency, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of Lukashenko's regime with refugees.
A drunk Polish nun caused an accident and tried to hide it.
After a while, the car returned to the accident site, but it was already being driven by another nun who was trying to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for failing to give way while driving and fleeing the scene of the accident, she came clean, according to TVN24 station.
She admitted that she had collided with another nun who had asked her for help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breath test and, after finding that she had over two parts per thousand of alcohol in her blood, they immediately revoked her driver's license.
At the same time, they informed her that she would be confessing her actions in court.
Dog Hugo is doing his best.
Juraj Šajmovič didn't watch his movie.
Czech creators of family comedies drew inspiration from American stories about canine companions.
But they forgot the essential thing: the laws of the film craft.
After the kitschy film F. Brabec's Gump - The Dog Who Taught People to Live, another movie, Here We Guard, is now vying for audience emotions in cinemas.
Co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič ml. freely continues his previous film Tady hlídám já from 2012.
Talking dachshund Hugo returns to the scene, along with some familiar characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, owners of the Bohemian pension, which is declining, so they start to invite dog owners, Julie's father with his partner and especially her daughter Veronica.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl, experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Sajmovic (who is also the producer of the film) had already struggled with storytelling techniques in their previous dog movie, but at least it entertained the children and the dog.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script, which evokes a mixture of amazement and embarrassment.
Let's summarize it.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to superstitious delusions in her longing for a child and, if the right "constellation" comes, copulates with her forest engineer Ivan wherever the coordinates determine - on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course during the ongoing excursion with the local guide), the retired colonel Mojmír, despite his long training, shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which she is taken to the hospital by the family, so that a miraculous healing process can take place in the heart of the Bohemian forest with the help of a dog.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of animal companions.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer is amazed at how much of a content jumble full of unbelievable situations and characters was necessary for this message.
A pair of thieves from the staff, a dog show competition, a Bohemian charlatan, police officers arriving on a tip to search for "drugs" and discussing herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal - and which the crazy family in the pension of course gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes up from a long coma and immediately sits curled and made up with a cigar at the family table, demanding her father's whisky and steak as a cured vegetarian, it is impossible not to laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma".
Shaimovich's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to construct supporting situations, a sense of character and point of view, and directorial guidance.
The acting performances are uneven, the editing is helpless, and the overall impression is muddled.
No matter how hard Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to keep their party going, they don't have much to play with.
The only positive aspect of the film remains the poetic shots of the Bohemian Forest by cameraman Vladimir Holomka and the pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to sketch a few characters, a weak plot, and dog puns, let alone more popular vulgar expressions that the characters indulge in.
Nor is long-term membership in the Dachshund Club - as in the case of the producer lady - an argument.
Behind the good intentions of promoting nature and the friendship between man and dog, there must also be knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
That didn't work out in this case.
There is a bit too much eroticism and not enough sentiment for the genre in this good family movie.
Even as an advertisement for equine therapy, this amateurish piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant insults from idiots like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, here it is seen how you don't understand it, but that is only because you have never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if they don't want to, the answer will always be no.
If you kept listening to such advice all the time, you might change your opinion.
It's a job like any other, in this case a part-time job for extra income.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only season of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have recorded at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israeli Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term average rainfall for November.
The two-day rain this week was more of an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
It's also the right Christmas setting, Wasim Aškar, a resident of Nazareth, rejoiced.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is sporadic and irregular.
Forests are dependent on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It's not just about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, was filled to the brim this spring due to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been decreasing.
Water managers have been warning about drought for a long time.
"It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there may be a decrease in precipitation," Uri Schor, a spokesman for the Israeli Water Authority, predicted in 2018.
Israel is able to help itself with technologies such as desalination or recycling of wastewater.
Economically weaker countries such as Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the Jordanian capital, Amman, the number of tankers is increasing.
Water mains and private wells are drying up.
"This year my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years," reported Imád Sulejman, a tanker truck driver, in September.
Clashes between farmers and security forces broke out in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The local riverbed was completely dry.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military intervention against Iran.
The Israeli Defense Minister declared that the Vienna talks had not made "any progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz on Saturday declared that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, according to Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the US, is trying to convince Americans to ramp up their pressure on Iran, but also to inform Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna had not made "any progress" and that the world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing games with them".
This happened to me about 3 years ago.
I was a bit attracted to the lady and grilled her in the conversation to find out what she really wanted from me.
Finally, I found out that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I really don't like these tricks, I kept questioning the girl for a while and finally thanked her and left.
Go ahead and tell me I'm a scoundrel, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains over the weekend, expecting plenty of snow and nice weather.
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced their first major influx of skiing enthusiasts this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the work week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have opened due to this.
The skiers were not deterred by the requirement to show a Covid certificate at the lifts.
While ski lift operators are not complaining about lack of customers, some ski equipment rental companies report weaker demand for their services than before the pandemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region set off for running tracks and ski slopes over the weekend.
The weather was favorable for skiers today, offering both sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really worked out from the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," praised the interest of the Ještěd Sports Area Director Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people also headed to the Jeseníky Mountains for the first weekend of skiing of the new season.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov and the resort in Branné in Šumpersko were open.
The weekend attendance was very decent, an estimated 400 people came on Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, Rostislav Procházka, the representative of the ski resort in Branné, did not spare praise.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or within the period after recovering from Covid-19.
With the exception of people being prepared and providing the necessary documents, said Rene Hrones from the ski center Spindleruv Mlyn to CTK.
"We have only recorded a few incidents," he added.
Some rental shops and ski equipment stores are reporting lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Opava Skiopava store.
A greater influx is expected during the ski course period.
David Šinták, the director of the Snowbear company in Královéhradecký, also feels that due to Covid there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were already almost borrowed out.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are probably at 50 percent, Šinták told CTK.
According to him, people have become lazy due to the pandemic and have learned to stay at home.
On the contrary, the rental agency in the Novako area in Boží Dar has seen a great demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago and now interested parties have to order them in advance.
"We are starting to rent out skis this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the area operator.
According to her, the interest is comparable to the period before the epidemic, also for the ski school.
If we want successful and wealthy people to stay in the country, they must have the opportunity to experience a quality life here as they would abroad.
Certainly, that does not include socialist healthcare, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or specialist doctor.
Smart and capable people are leaving abroad who have no property here.
The owner of the company won't just leave for abroad.
I completely agree with the rest.
If these people do not have a good life in the Czech Republic and if they do not have a reasonable vision of the future in the Czech Republic, then they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary started when one beautiful day Orbán won, ruled for a year and suddenly the annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
Another question is are there even elections?
If we live stupidly here, then some traditional V4 crazy person can also win here.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters and people whose wealth cannot fit into an airplane will remain.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in the blood due to a bet on beer?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the movie Island, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), was enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor then posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it just makeup for filming?
The London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petr's disappearance is completely out of character and we are starting to worry about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in Lambeth, where Srncová worked, in a Saturday video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 pm on Sunday, November 28th and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncová acted as an "assistant to nurses" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital group.
"We have immense concerns for our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of healthcare facilities said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help her to find to contact the police," the statement continued.
Public is also being called to cooperate by MP Harriet Harman, who highlighted the case of the Roe Deer on Saturday during a press conference.
"She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death," said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have an especially big responsibility to try to find her, because she was away from her home country, away from her family and working here for our healthcare," Harmanová said.
The police had previously arrested a man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC news website, however, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what he is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTGs (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine either.
These are not "huge amounts", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is getting fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know what made you conclude that Russia wants war.
War is damn expensive fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparing it to the situation in '38 is so different in so many ways that I don't even know where to start.
Now I can compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia would annex those ridiculous republics.
That's all and that would correspond to that "concentration" at the borders.
Well, agreements must be kept...
In Prague, new timetables have been in effect since Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections.
Passengers in Prague's integrated transport (PID) will face several changes from Sunday, mainly concerning suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed their route, and others disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is now being integrated into the integrated system.
In the capital city, express trains from České Budějovice stop at Zahradní Město station on Sundays.
In suburban rail transport, S7 trains will depart, which on the route from Beroun to Český Brod pass through Prague Main Station.
The newly opened Prague-Zahradní Město station will now be served by the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov.
PID will be expanded to other areas.
In addition, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatná u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses will be integrated in the Mladá Boleslav region, including lines extending to the Liberec and Královéhradecký regions.
During integration, 77 lines will be abolished, 37 new ones will be introduced, and the operation of 12 existing ones will be adjusted.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague Zličín and go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovnik was also created, replacing the discontinued S53 train line.
The services will be strengthened during the morning peak and on weekends from Prague to Rakovnik, when the new express line number 404 will be launched.
Lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec Region have now been included in the PID system.
They are departing from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Holešovice train station.
Line 400 runs through Mělník, Dubou and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The 410 supplemental line runs through Mělník and Duba to Doks, Mimoně and Jablonného in Podještědí.
On the contrary, the operation on ten Central Bohemian local lines has been cancelled or restricted, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Due to modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín routes.
Changes await travelers at other locations as well.
Buses are replacing some of the discontinued railway lines or extending the section on line 420 from Dobříš with connections from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsko.
Routes 540 to 543 in Nymburk have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen Region have been adjusted.
Healthy snack/lunch for the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm doing the classic 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option to get food is to go next door to Billy or a bit further to Lidl.
Since I have no exercise, I don't have the energy to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and diet as much as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I buy at most pizza rolls and for a snack yogurt and an apple.
Question: What healthy food without the need for cooking would you recommend me to buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately that is the case.
It's not about the trees that you have to necessarily see.
Under the snow, only the tip of a tree can be hidden.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying it's the only reason why they forbid us to go off-piste, but it is one of them.
Dara's Confession about her Relationship with Nedved: I was not looking forward to this at all.
The Czech showbiz pond has been living nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedved since Friday.
They've been together since summer, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to the fans, in which she explains why she kept her love from them for a long half year.
"I dare to say that currently there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who has not noticed that Dara caught a bear, sorry, Nedved," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
He supposedly packed her up, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they don't take joy in it.
And here it is.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but knew would eventually happen, continues the singer.
I just don't know who is worse off.
Whether it's those who don't care at all and it jumps out of the can at them, or us, whose lives are dissected in detail.
As if someone wanted to hear your opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend fit together, or you insisted that everyone should know your list of ex-partners and be familiar with your mistakes and errors.
That's what you want, it bothers Dara.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rolins was going for the preparation of her new fashion collection.
Nedved is once again working long-term as vice president of the Juventus football club.
They only went public with the truth now because they were waiting for Nedved's divorce to be finalized.
Ivan and his wife had been separated for three years, they are not officially divorced yet but it has only been three weeks.
In any case, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We are not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new man and just like he stands by me, I stand by him too. In good and in bad, Rolins concluded.
Hi, the other commenters have probably already said everything important, I just confirm that dorms are great to start with, my classmates usually got to know each other and became friends during the first semester or two and then found flats together, which seems to me like the best option, because you know who you will be living with.
Apartments usually aren't advertised too far in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it won't hurt to take a look at the offers.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), and some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student-oriented, Královo Pole and that direction is great, besides it is close to most faculties of VUT (I don't know where you are exactly enrolling).
I have never looked for a rental, but I'm a native of Brno, so I can possibly help with Brno as such, if you still need any information :)
That's an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what a few doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually okay that the state does not sufficiently fund some schools.
Either they can learn whatever they want and pay for it themselves or they can follow the state and have the state pay for it.
We cannot let a private actor take control of a piece of the education system just because they add a few coins to the full state contribution and can teach whatever they want in the schools.
Such a statement loses some of its weight when it is written by a person who two days before expressed himself in this way about a petition for a boycott of a totalitarian state.
So a vote against someone getting an abortion is the same to you as a vote against a statue standing in a square?
If I were you, I would consult directly with the person who assigned you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced cataloging/digitization where (even long-term professionals) either guess or write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and note that it is unreadable.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I wouldn't really recommend it.
Personally, I would deal with it in a note depending on which program you are using.
If you want to be a diligent and hardworking student, you can look into some sign databases and find the closest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from some book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created their own symbol that fits what is physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it rather the Odrysian Empire (Kingdom) rather than OdryNská?
PS: Someone has already solved it here.
Look at that comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians don't even know what will be the "theme" of our presidency.
This is much worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that something would be approved because no one understood some text is amusing.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, basic knowledge of English is not enough for that, that is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts and establishing extra-standard relationships.
Furthermore, it's quite interesting with the English language, after the UK's departure from the EU.
I don't understand the hate for Cejl.
I've been working there for three years and it's going great.
I go from work at 10 pm and never have any problems.
Only someone who has hardly ever stepped foot in the ghetto can say that it is a ghetto.
Yeah, most of the Roma population of Brno lives there, but all they do is block the sidewalk and park where they shouldn't :D definitely not something that would make me afraid to go out on the street at night.
So if you're looking for relatively affordable housing with good access to the city center, I'd go for it.
There are now a lot of apartments newly renovated or newly built there.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda and his lover Gelemová like a stick in the fence!
Who will you spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, but Felix Slováček didn't.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dad's wreath and Lucy definitely has one too, said the saxophonist Blesk, thus confirming Patrasova's words that she often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda stayed alone after his departure.
Slovacek still doesn't know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
Recently we met with Anička, Felix, and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we still talked to each other, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I'm buying gifts gradually and I'll definitely buy something for Dad and Lucy, maybe perfume.
I'm a gentleman, Felix added, who came to the music video launch party at Richman club himself.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
Slováček always finds someone to have a good time with, he was glad to meet Luděk Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
He made it clear.
And are we Iceland to be able to afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt anyone will defend us and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be an absolute idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why that should be a bad argument, so explain it to me?
I don't know any other folder that could be deployed in hospitals in crisis.
There are not enough police officers and they cannot afford it, the same goes for firefighters and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of health-trained people at such a level.
That our army is capable of defending just Ostrava goes against the previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for quite a while.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the countryside should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
Czech Republic is going through the worst period of drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountain and sub-mountain areas, and even places where there was no shortage of moisture are recording lower amounts of rainfall.
The cause of the drought prevailing in much of Central Europe is climate change.
The impacts are further exacerbated by the way we manage the soil.
What should one prepare for in relation to drought?
How can we help nature in difficult times?
Well, it's like this, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I don't know what it's like to play hockey and the tactics (that I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are also pretty wild.
Whether you are the hockey team "Polar Bear Russia" or "Llama China" losing by two goals when you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when the score is tied.
But anyway, what I hear from Czech commentators pointing out what referees pay attention to or don't pay attention to, whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably the same with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And in my opinion, if it were the other way around, it would be like always, and since Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would be the classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: Number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11th, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
5,766 people have been hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people have died in the Czech Republic, plus another 74.
The confirmed cases in the Czech Republic for the last 14 days is 1967 per 100 000, 871 per 100 000 for the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been recorded.
It is the lowest daily count since October 13th.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, it is the lowest daily number of deaths since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omikron, said Dr. Susan Hopkinsová, the Chief Medical Adviser to the British Health Safety Agency, on Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be necessary.
People infected with Omikron are already being hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their number to increase.
So far, no one has died from Omikron, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
On Sunday, British Labour leader Keir Starmer stated that Boris Johnson likely broke the law by hosting a Christmas quiz in Downing Street in December last year, when a lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister of Johnson's government defended that the quiz was held "virtually", via computer.
However, groups of employees gathered around computers participated in Downing Street.
Pressure is mounting in Britain to remove Johnson from the Prime Minister's office.
Despite the strict lockdown imposed in London last December, when Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers organized numerous parties.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government have been making a mockery of them.
Paul Brand, editor of commercial television ITV for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a resounding majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is speaking about the need to remove him from the position of Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events have unfolded.
Do you want to turn and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting spring elections that could end Viktor Orban's twelve-year rule.
These will be elections of European-wide significance.
How much can be expected to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't be free either, because the last two elections under Orbán weren't either.
His party Fidesz controls the media, changes electoral boundaries to benefit itself, and does other small or large tricks.
The last one so far sounds like everyone can choose where they want to practice voting.
This will allow Fidesz to move voters from decided districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that there won't be any fairness at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
Previously, it was not about whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that the unified opposition will gain more votes and mandates.
This is a big surprise for Viktor Orban and his party.
Will they strive to maintain power by playing even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have been doing so far.
Recently, a recording of the Speaker of the Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, leaked to independent media, where he explains to the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the indications of the new approach you are talking about?
Yes, that is one of the news.
It all starts with language.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my mom doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has it for a long time, but then he explodes extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I'm very choleric and I used to get angry as a child terribly, to the point that I would lie on the ground in a spasm and turn blue, they probably took me under the shower twice to calm me down.
Sometimes they would give me a disciplinary slap, sometimes it was more like they didn't know what else to do.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence now, as a child I used to fight quite a bit, now I just punch something to let off steam and when I was younger I would maybe slap my parents' hand (so I wouldn't get a spanking), so never anything extreme, but I always have that urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it is my explosiveness, but certainly upbringing also has its share in it.
I'm afraid I'm going to start losing patience with my kids and dealing with it the same way.
I think that hitting children is simply wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at that moment when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration. On the other hand, maybe every parent screws up something, so it's probably impossible not to spoil your children at least a little bit, so I don't blame them for it.
It doesn't offend me at all, I don't understand why OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would therefore call those who create laws of such quality legislators.
Otherwise, I would be interested to know if you are afraid of a loss of income?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying the product so that you will have enough to pay off the mortgage?
Kočner's Monstrous World.
Where will Slovakia move the process with the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial in the process with the four defendants accused of murdering Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová is beginning.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
She mobilized civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marian Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
What major shift will the process mean for Slovakia?
This is huge and it's all thanks to the journalists.
How is it possible that this petition had significantly more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which was released a day or two later?
No way, they let themselves get carried away and the company had to pay the price.

Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage facilities nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be drastically revised.
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is at an end and the law that was supposed to ensure the respect of the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and permitting of a deep geological repository for highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Government Legislative Council has suspended the discussion of the proposal submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
Its content is, however, in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against Deep Storage, but also with the Association of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-governments are expecting a significant strengthening of their decision-making powers regarding storage, as promised by the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Law and European Directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will revise the proposal in cooperation with municipalities.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which Platforma has available, is mainly criticized by municipalities: The proposed degree of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of selecting the location for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
Truly effective can only be if the municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the given location.
This can be ensured by entrusting the Storage Administration with the obligation to request the consent of the affected municipalities before initiating a specific procedure.
The presented draft of the substantive plan almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes citizens of the municipalities practically mere statistics in the permitting process.
The proposal lacks a system setting for compensations for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a location for the storage, its permitting and operation.
Representatives of municipalities do not have many options to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a place for a storage facility according to current legal standards.
Only in certain authorization proceedings can they submit their comments or appeal, however, the decision is made by the office or minister in whose interest it is to issue the permit.
Any lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on the carrying out of exploration or construction works.
The co-decision of local authorities, which the Platform is requesting, is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries and certainly in those where storage has already been allowed, such as Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms for the preparation of legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and following contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total amount for this work is to be almost 4 million crowns according to the contract registry.
Antonín Seknička, mayor of the municipality of Cejle from the locality of Hrádek and spokesperson for the Platform against Deep Storage said: We expect a more significant turnaround from the new government than from the industry ministers, who only pushed the adjustment of the position of the local authorities towards the state authorities in the search for a deep storage of highly radioactive waste to their successors.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Association of Towns and Municipalities, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental structure similarly to the directly affected municipalities in the selected locations.
The platform against deep storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state's approach to dealing with spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage.
The platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of the location for potential storage should be conditional on the prior consent of the affected municipalities.
Fear drove actor John Goodman (69) to lose weight: He shed 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, eventually he was scared by the doctors.
They told him that if he doesn't lose weight, he will die.
And that did the trick.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, according to The Sun newspaper.
He boasted of his new figure in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family asked him to lose weight because his large body caused furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in an interview for AARP in 2018.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still, said Goodman to ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss and in what context you want to use the word "boss".
If it's a text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text, such as a university text, I would probably look for ways to describe or explain it better.
There are more types of bosses for everything.
Games like Dark Souls have several bosses, right? So, a "boss" is like the ruler/lord of a given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) that are not necessary to defeat in order to complete the game or level, but they are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player does not fight them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), so how can they be called?
And then there are mini bosses.
It is generally impossible to translate the word "boss" into one word, neither Czech nor other languages can solve this (Catalan is interesting, as it translates "boss" as the final enemy).
It is simply significant for a story or game in general, computer-controlled, a stronger opponent than all previous ones and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is searching for the missing Peter from London.
The Czech police have also become involved.
British police have been searching for the missing Peter Srncové since December 3rd.
The Czech police also joined the search.
This 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišťsko has been sought since December 7th.
Through Interpol, it also helps the British police.
Czech Petra Srncovou was last seen by her colleagues on November 28th.
The British police have been searching for her since December 3rd.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow notice due to her.
The whole world is looking for Peter.
"The Czech police are closely cooperating with the British police," confirmed police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
"We are sharing information about the case," she added.
The search for Peter has now been announced on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, thin, has brown eyes and long, straight hair of the same color.
She should come from Uherskohradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
Harriet Harman, the local MP, also joined the search for Peter.
She got involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face.
"We have huge concerns about her," she said at the Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have arrested a suspect.
However, it is not clear who it is and what he had in common with Petra.
Czech Christmas is being terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decrease in attack campaigns, last month with the approaching end of the year the attacks significantly intensified.
We recorded a major campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the email should raise the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
Whereas last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in its name, this time it was labeled as "Copy of Receipt Corrections for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains functions that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials which are then sent to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of attackers is again increasing.
In November, the Formbook spyware remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic and security specialists in November detected more of a global campaign.
Compared to October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still accounts for nearly one fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on the 3rd, 10th, and 15th of November.
The formbook usually contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name receipt still appears.
An attachment in Czech can be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts have noted a significant decrease and dampening of activity with the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and had no major offensive campaigns in the Czech Republic in the last few months.
Today's demo of smart people who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated fools.
The march through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
According to the shots of the procession along the waterfront and my experience of the demonstrator, I am not afraid to estimate around 10 thousand people.
The people in the procession filled the quay and the bridge and the opposite quay communication.
That means that there are really a lot of people.
A spontaneous influx of passers-by joined the procession of around four thousand demonstrators.
I claim that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
The lasting dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population led to them finding a common language.
Only the anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers and their associates could not fill or pay for such a large procession.
The action of the Chcípl pes club is gaining popularity, it reminds me of the Million Moments for Democracy in reverse.
Sometimes I get the feeling that they even rent the same stage and equipment.
It is hard to say what movement could be cobbled together from this discontent, it depends not only on the influx of money, but also on whether the Pfizer three-dose vaccine does not become a four or more dose one.
It definitely won't be a left-wing or centrist movement, bet on it.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, as it is evident that we will have to get re-vaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that the vaccines saved us.
An ingenious action of scientists which humanity is rightly proud of.
The end of the foot, Bulgaria has a new Prime Minister proclaiming change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We Continue the Change, which won the November elections, with forming a new government.
Tom has already managed to assemble a broad coalition government that is expected to take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost the elections due to the pressure of anti-corruption protests.
The victorious parties advocating the fight against bribery and abuse of power, however, were unable to reach an agreement, so two more premature elections followed.
What do cats do when nobody is watching?
The secretly taken shots have become a global hit.
In Britain over the weekend, concerns grew about the fate of the 32-year-old Czech woman whom London police have been searching for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work to the south of the British metropolis.
In addition to the police, the former employer of the children's hospital worker and the MP representing the part of London where she lived are also calling for information.
"Petr's disappearance is completely out of character and we are starting to worry about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in Lambeth, where Srncová worked, in a Saturday video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 pm on Sunday, November 28th and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncová acted as an "assistant to nurses" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital group.
"We have immense concerns for our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of healthcare facilities said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help her to find to contact the police," the statement continued.
An anonymous informant reported that Šumperk amateur painter of children's rooms Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also regional Pirate Councilor) is violating copyright with her paintings.
However, the court ruled that the paintings of Krtek in the Šumperk rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a moon-shaped hole in the road in the form of an uncovered canal.
It was a matter of life and death.
The municipality referred complaints to the Road and Motorway Directorate, which owns the road, and since it allegedly did not respond, the hole remained open.
Finally, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership and after a month the Road and Motorway Directorate began to "intensively resolve the situation".
