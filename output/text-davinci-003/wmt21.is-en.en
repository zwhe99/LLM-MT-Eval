Cry out to the world
The Looks Like You Need Iceland marketing campaign seems to have gotten off to a good start and the calls and cries out in nature are beginning to draw people from far and wide around the world.
"You own the puzzle, I need Iceland," says a woman out in the big world in response to an ad from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on the YouTube channel.
Another spectator said they will preserve Iceland in their heart forever and a young woman said she will go to Iceland as soon as possible because her beloved is settled there.
To everyone's dismay, she is in the United States and therefore expects to have to wait for another month.
Another spectator asks if the route to Iceland is feasible, since there are no planes.
The story does not follow whether he comes from another time period.
Egill Thordarson from the advertising agency Peel, who created the advertisements in collaboration with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says the reception has been better than expected.
"I have been on many Inspired By Iceland trips that have gone very well, but this new trip is already exceeding expectations."
At the core, this is about creating PR value, that is, getting foreign media to talk about the expedition, and it has gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received coverage in around seven hundred media outlets around the world, which together reach approximately two billion people.
The value of this discussion is priced at 1.8 billion krona.
"It's not embarrassing."
The main market is always the United States and the journey has gone very well there even though Americans are not on their way to the country in a hurry.
According to Egil, markets such as Denmark, Britain and Germany have also taken well to it, as has Russia, which came as a pleasant surprise.
Then responses have come from foreign areas, such as India, which were not specifically set up.
"These ads have traveled further than we expected," says Egill, and it can be noted that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
"We couldn't have asked for a better start."
The pictures at the opening were taken by Árni Sæberg, a photographer from Morgunblaðið, for advertisements with the headline "Let It Out" in the middle of last month.
The tours went far and wide, such as on Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavík, at Reynisfjara, by Skógafoss, at Sólheimajökull and in the cave at Hjörleifshöfði.
The directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson from Skoti productions and the cinematographer was Óttar Guðnason.
In the roles of the lead characters were Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungary.
Icelandic actors came to make the commercials, but at the same time as the recordings were taking place in the South, another group was in the West and Westfjords.
According to Egil, "Let It Out" is only the first step in the Looks Like You Need Iceland journey, with a winter journey in collaboration with M&C Saatchi planned.
"This is just the first phase of this work for the Icelandic Agency," says Egill and adds that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone exceptionally well.
It's great to work with them.
In such projects, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking about.
Sprengisandur: Discuss the situation in the labor market, pension fund and much more.
Minister of Social Affairs and Children's Affairs, Ásmundur Einar Daðason, will be attending the meeting at Sprengisand starting at ten o'clock today at Bylgjunni.
He is also the Minister of Labour and oversees the situation in the labour market, such as the Icelandair issue and other matters.
He also manages rural affairs and the relocation of work to rural areas which have been performing poorly and have been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, chairman of VR, also attends the program and will discuss his criticism of pension fund investments and presents ideas for the labor movement and businesses to withdraw from the funds' boards to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Then a discussion will be held with Ívar Ingimarsson, a travel service provider in East Iceland, and Árnheiði Jóhannsdóttur, Director of the Northern Region Marketing Board, about the status of travel services in the countryside.
They will look ahead to the autumn and ponder whether the success of the summer is a warning sign of what is to come.
You can listen to the episode below starting at ten o'clock.
This is what she looked like 25 years ago.
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in various teen shows.
She still gained fame for her role as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in the series Sabrina: The Teenage Witch alongside Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Not much has been heard from her lately, but she still managed to look back on her past and talk about Clueless on Australian television recently.
She speaks fondly of Brittany Murphy who unexpectedly passed away in 2009 and says she was a wonderful person.
I have to admit that I built the character mostly on girls I met in school who were not good to me.
As I read the script I knew who this character was," Donovan said about his role in Clueless.
I didn't want to leave the police station after an overnight stay
Fifty cases came to the police force in the capital area today and the police log says that the cases were varied.
The day at the police station on Hverfisgata began with the police having to deal with a man who had recently been released from prison after having been detained there for drunk driving.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey the police instructions to leave.
The man earned himself a continuous stay at the police station due to his success.
A man was arrested this morning suspected of breaking into a company in Kópavogur.
The police also had to deal with two people in Breiðholt due to a report of physical assault.
Then it also happened that a woman who was eating in a shopping center in Kópavogur could not pay for the bill after the meal and was therefore called to the police.
Additionally, a theft of a car in the city center was reported yesterday.
A white Renault van driver was looking for it for a while and then it was taken without permission.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Joybringer - The Terrible Fate of the Glitter Stars
The rumor has spread on the internet that the cast of Glee is cursed, as actress Naya Rivera drowned in California recently, making her the third main cast member to pass away before their time.
The shows about the Glee club (e.g. Glee) are a popular series about singing, dancing, and joy.
The series revolved around a so-called youth joy group in a high school, their loves and destinies.
It was not always taken for granted to be in the joyous group, but through singing and dancing the characters seemed to be able to overcome whatever circumstances arose in their lives.
Outside forces have caused great distress to the actors and staff of the show, so much so that rumors have arisen that a curse lies on the show.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez in the series, Glee, which didn't call all of her grandmothers.
After the series had run its course, Rivera began dating actor Ryan Dorsey and had her first and only child with him, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they subsequently divorced.
Dorsey refused to file a complaint and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8th of last year, it was announced that River was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life vest on board the boat and he was able to tell the police that he and his mother had jumped overboard and then Rivera had pulled him back into the boat but had never returned himself.
A large-scale search for Rivera has begun.
The day after the search began, the police chief in the area concluded that the search was based on the assumption that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially declared dead.
It is said that she had been caught in a strong current in the water and used her last strength to save her son.
Drunk driving was registered as a cause of accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the series, the American football player with the angelic voice who played a key role in bringing the Glee Club to prominence and respect.
Despite the appearances, Moneith still dealt with personal devils.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and it proved difficult to escape from it.
In 2013, his collaborators found enough in the episodes, intervened and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and it seemed like everything was looking up.
Only two months after he finished his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
The cocktail proved to be a pleasant mix of spices and alcohol.
It was not thought to be a case of intent.
Moneith had gone through treatment and his tolerance for drugs had decreased so much that even small amounts he had previously tolerated well, proved to be dangerous.
He was only 31 years old when he passed away.
His death weighed heavily on his collaborators, but in support of his co-star Lea Michele, it was decided to continue shooting the episodes and dedicate them to the memory of Moneith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the show, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow members of the Glee Club, or until he mustered the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles suspected of selling child pornography.
A remarkable amount of children's toys was found during a search of his home and the matter was quickly made public.
It was clear that Salling was done.
He was subsequently charged and convicted for his crimes.
He was sentenced to four to seven years in prison, in addition to having to be registered as a sex offender and seek treatment for pedophilia.
Before the judge had decided the sentence, Salling, who was then released on bail, was found close to his home.
Danarosk was suicide.
It wasn't just the players of the show that fell far before their time.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the episodes.
He was suddenly taken in his sleep in 2013, only 41 years of age.
Also in the series, a woman named Nancy Motes won.
She was the younger sister of the big star Julia Roberts and did not carry a beautiful story for her sister, but she blamed Roberts for her great control and disrespectful behavior.
Mote took her own life in 2014 but she struggled with severe depression.
She left behind a letter to her beloved in which she said her mother and sister, among others, were responsible for how things had turned out for her.
„My mother and my so-called siblings get nothing from me except the memory that it was they who endured all my worst depression.“
Lea Michel was the star of the shows.
She has recently been accused of using her power and influence to manipulate the situation and be overly controlling.
Jesse Luken had a guest role in the series in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was considered a great offense.
Actress Heather Morris had a major role in the series.
In 2010, she became the victim of computer hackers who obtained and published nude photos of her on the Internet.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the series and had a relationship outside of the series.
Benoist later reported that Jenner had used violence in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything.
It increases the maturity of children when they get to play outside in the garden with their parents to cultivate flowers and get to watch them grow and bloom.
There is also an endless amount of things you can do with flowers, as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having a moment with the children in the garden is something that is never forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the breeze, and of course that precious time they had with their parents.
Bought himself a boat after the tenth grade
“I don't think there are many sailors who work in the kindergartens of the country,” says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who goes fishing in the summer and studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter.
Fishing on the beach is a very convenient summer job when you are in school.
If fishing is done well, it is possible to have good earnings and I find it great to be able to avoid taking out a student loan.
"The waders suit me just as well in the winter," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student, who goes fishing in the summer, just like the past summers.
Axel was the newest to the dock at Tálknafirði when a journalist caught up with him late in the evening at the beginning of the week.
"In the tenth grade I took a boat captain's license for boats under twelve meters long and I bought my boat the summer after I finished elementary school.
I have been fishing in my boat every summer since then.
I bought the boat used from my friend, Hartmann Jónsson, and I named the boat after his name.
Hartmann had become an adult when I bought the boat and stopped going to sea and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.
"Hartmann passed away a few years after I took over the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
I made an agreement with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of summer and the other half at the end of summer when I was done fishing.
I had the boat debt-free by the end of my first summer with it.
How could a boy have one and a half million to pay for a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
I had been saving up and had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I was fishing with him all summer and got my share.
I put my savings coins in my boat fund.
Axel was born in Isafjordur, where all of his family is from, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
"I can fish here on the west coast because I have a legal residence with my grandmother in Isafjordur."
I learned to row in this area here west of town with my dad.
I travel between fjords depending on how I feel, as this fishing area covers all of the Westfjords.
Although I prefer to be west, I have also traveled around Snæfellsnes and further.
"I have also been south, mostly for the grey plover," says Axel, who always lights a fire in the morning and sometimes talks to the seagulls and sings to the sky, in his solitary moments out on the beach.
The internet connection out at sea is good, so I can call, listen to podcasts and music.
I don't think it's a good idea to be alone on a boat.
Of course I try to avoid getting seasick, but certainly something has been happening occasionally, but never a great danger," says Axel, who is lucky enough that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the workday depends on how the fishing goes each time.
"In the fishing I'm never more than 14 hours on a fishing trip, but I've also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, and then I've been together in one and a half solar rings in the pasture out at sea to fish."
He says that the regulations for fishing in the sea are such that he can catch 770 kilos per day, which he finds satisfactory.
"Other restrictions are that I cannot fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I can only fish twelve days a month, these four months that the coastal fishing season is in effect, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to rush instead of having 48 days off throughout the summer and being able to choose according to their own will.
"So the division of the area could go my way and fishing grounds that are well placed for fishing should be able to enjoy it," says Axel, who mostly catches cod from the deep sea on his beach fishing trips, as well as occasionally some other species of fish.
Axel works over the winter season with his university degree at the Núpi kindergarten in Kópavogur.
"I think we are not many sailors who work in the kindergartens of the country," says Axel proudly and adds that he had only intended to work temporarily at the kindergarten.
I got stuck there because I find this job amazing.
"I hope that the psychology studies will be useful to me in the kindergarten level in the future," says Axel, who is also far along with his studies in business.
Registration prevented the homecoming party
A form in the registration booklet that people fill out when they come to the country was created so that an individual, residing in the country, was not called back for inspection.
There is no requirement to provide a national identification number if the individual fills out the form in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
"This will be looked at in the week," says an expert at the health department of the national physician.
Three domestic cases were diagnosed at the Department of Virology at the National Hospital yesterday.
One of those who tested positive arrived in the country on July 15, two days after the so-called homecoming rules took effect.
Those who were settled in Iceland are then screened upon arrival to the country and again invited for a test four to five days later.
It was reported in the noon news on RÚV that the person in question had followed the old system.
The inspection at the borders was negative and he was not called back for the inspection due to the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert in the field of public health, says in an interview with the news agency that this can be attributed to an error in the digital registration form.
It is not a requirement to enter a national identification number when filling out the registration form in English, as is the case with the Icelandic version.
However, it has primarily been designed for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person in question has not received an automatic invitation to take the test.
Kamilla says many have followed the rules for entry despite filling out the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been vigilant in sending people for testing again after they arrived in the country.
"This will be looked at during the week to see how to make it easier for people to access this to draw attention to the process."
The man is in isolation and six have been placed in quarantine.
They all went to the screening, but two had already shown signs.
Contact tracing is now underway for the three cases that were identified yesterday, and it is mostly completed due to the two cases that were reported on Friday.
In both cases, Icelandic genealogy research has revealed that there are variants of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the other case, the farmers have directly targeted Israel, even though it is known that the one who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says that it should be known tomorrow where the other wind is coming from.
There are now 15 in quarantine according to the COVID.is website.
There are 135 in quarantine.
Four out of five infections are unrelated
Five domestic cases have been confirmed in the country in recent days.
Of them, four are completely unrelated and, for example, the source of the infection that arose at the Rey Cup Sports Tournament yesterday has not yet been found.
Discrimination is still prevalent.
Originally, thirty individuals were sent into quarantine, but that number was reduced to sixteen.
In total, there are 34 in quarantine due to these new infections that were identified yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that an infection has been detected at a sporting event and it has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, communications manager of the National Police Commissioner's public safety division, says it is perfectly possible, as long as people follow the guidelines and regulations.
We are constantly reminding all those who live here that individual protective measures must be maintained.
We also need to remind people who are holding events that there are certain rules in place that need to be followed.
"Then it is possible to hold an event," says Johann.
He says it is possible to prevent infection by using individual protective measures.
Rules and criteria should also be subject to constant review.
What needs to be done, and what the Public Health Department and the Chief Medical Officer are constantly emphasizing to people, is to adhere to these individual protective measures.
Both at home and likewise with service companies.
People should wash their hands and use hand sanitizer.
"It prevents the spread of infection," says Johann.
"We need to encourage people to continue on the good path we were on, in order to maintain the success we have achieved so far."
40% of COVID-19 fatalities had type 2 diabetes.
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult her father had to struggle to breathe.
Her father had diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was gone.
Death was attributed to rapid respiratory failure due to coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was listed on the death certificate as an underlying condition and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is afraid that he may not survive.
Reuters news agency says Brumfield's fear is not unfounded.
Figures from a new research conducted by US authorities show that around 40% of those tested were found to have type 2 diabetes as an underlying condition.
When the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65 is examined, the proportion increases to half.
A study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) looked at more than 10,000 people in 15 countries who died from coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an epidemiologist at the CDC, says the results are striking, especially for those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their friends.
It fell into a gentle growth Reuters conducted a survey and the responses from the 12 countries that responded were comparable in proportion.
10 states, including California, Arizona, and Columbia, have not yet begun to distinguish underlying diseases.
"The sugar rush was already fading away slowly.
"Now, COVID-19 has broken out like a powerful force of nature," said Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago, according to Reuters.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, who have also fared worse in the coronavirus pandemic.
The best defense for those with type 2 diabetes is to keep the disease in check with exercise, a healthy diet, and support from healthcare professionals.
However, the coronavirus outbreak has made it difficult for many to maintain their routine over the past week.
Therefore, the high cost of insuline has caused some to continue to go to work and thus avoid being exposed to the virus.
Reuters suggests that US authorities may have been aware of the risks posed to those with type 2 diabetes from the virus.
In 2003 when SARS coronavirus spread, around 20% of those infected with the virus were at risk of being hospitalized three times more than in the swine flu outbreak of 2009.
When MERS first appeared in 2012, a study showed that 60% of those who died or were hospitalized had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that due to the impact of the COVID-19 virus, the pandemic could have uncovered a multitude of previously unknown side effects.
"I fear that we will see a flood of problems when this is over," says Andrew Bolton, chairman of the International Diabetes Federation.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus pandemic could lead to an increase in complications related to diabetes, including new diseases and new understanding.
One recent study suggests that coronavirus could lead to an increase in diabetes cases.
Reuters reports that scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and type 2 diabetes.
Our focus is on the heart, lungs, and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
Then, an imbalance of glucose and lipids in diabetics can cause a real "frenzy of counter-regulation", as it is called when the immune system reacts too harshly and overwhelms the body.
Recreational drugs can also lead to vasoconstriction which can cause dangerous blood loss.
"This is all one big puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
"It all ties together."
The news has been corrected.
"We were offered mulled wine, so they left the inn."
Husband and wife Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason were presented with the unusual request from artist Ragnar Kjartanssyni to have sex in front of a camera for a work the artist was putting up in Paris.
"We love each other so this wasn't difficult."
Atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and mother of his children, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir.
I was very charmed by her.
It was naturally just the illumination but it seemed to me also quite incredibly sweet.
And he still thinks so," he says.
Asrun likes this too, and her husband regularly rakes up the first found.
I'm always hearing this story.
"Just last weekend," she says, who was also charmed by her husband at first sight.
"I found and still find so much fuss around Atla that I flee."
"There is a lot going on and a lot happening and I am delighted by it."
Atli says that the couple has emphasized in their relationship to go their own way.
"We don't tie our bags with the same knots as our fellow travelers.
We break away from routines that we recognize around us.
It is possibly the reason why they took the commission from Ragnar Kjartanssyni, the artist, just cheerfully, even though it was to say the least, unusual.
„Our mutual friend Kristín Anna has contacted us and asked if we can join her, Ragga, and Ingibjörgu, Ragnar's wife, for dessert at Snaps.“
They were invited, they met at Snaps and got themselves a dessert wine and each their own dessert.
They listened to Ragnar who led them through his plans for an art exhibition he intended to set up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
He had a multi-colored video work called Scenes from Western Culture.
He explained it in a simple way.
Asrun says he has described the work as banal and decadent scenes from the everyday life of Westerners.
"He had sketches of all the scenes he intended to shoot and lastly he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in taking part in it."
The scene that Ragnar asked the pair to take part in was meant to show young couples in love in a minimalistic room.
"These are journeys with a beginning and an end," says Atli.
The couple didn't know Ragnar very well, even though they had heard of him and he of them, "but they knew us and it seemed to fit into this."
They had agreed that they would not advertise for people.
Maybe they thought they wouldn't get the right people, but people who would get sexual gratification from performing for others.
They called Ragnar and agreed to think about the matter but it didn't take long.
"When we ran out of Snaps, we said: Aren't we just here for this?"
That's just the way it was.
"I trusted Ragnar as an artist and his whole team," says Ásrún and Atli agrees.
"This is about love and friendship."
Sean was taken up in a nice apartment on Myrargata Street.
There was a very small film crew; the cameraman, Ragnar, and the soundman and the pair.
After filming had started, everyone left the room to wait outside in the car except Atli and Asrun.
We hadn't decided how we should be.
We got some small instructions but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
"We didn't play, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Ásrún.
Was this romantic?
"Yes, that was a bit romantic," says Atli and Ásrún agrees.
We were offered a glass of champagne before they left the hotel.
It was kind of like being in a nice hotel in Paris on vacation.
The team was pleased with the performance of the pair in the work that moved them.
"When Tommi the painter looked at this, he cried, it seemed so beautiful to him," says Atli.
"This is just as much about love and closeness and the relationships themselves," says Ásrún.
The parents of the artist have seen the work and Atli says his mother heard the voice in the exhibition at the Reykjavik Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
"Then she turns around and starts to ponder this," says Atli.
"Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
"We hadn't told anyone about this, but then my dad sends me a message saying, 'It's great to run into the little family at Palais de Tokyo,'" Ásrún recites.
And do you think that participation in the project has deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atli?
"We are still together anyway, so maybe this deepened something."
"This deepened my connection with the extended family," says Ásrún with a laugh.
Ásrún saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleagues.
"It was a bit difficult for me to be with someone else instead of you," she says, turning to her husband.
"It was fun to see this because this is just one scene in a much larger work and when you saw this with the other works it was very nice."
I managed to break away from this and was just proud.
And there was a little baby inside me," says Ásrún, who was already pregnant with the couple's other child when the pregnancy was discovered.
"That was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke with Ásrún and Atli in Ástarsögur on Rás 1.
Swansea won their first knockout match
Swansea won 1-0 against Brentford in a dramatic match.
This was the previous game of the teams in the playoffs to get into the English Premier League.
The game took place at Swansea's home ground in Wales.
The score at halftime was 0–0.
The home team in Swansea were awarded a penalty on the 64th minute and Andre Ayew took the penalty kick and fired it past the goalkeeper.
Only two minutes earlier, Rico Henry, a Brentford player, received the red card.
Brentford played the rest of the game with one man less and in the 82nd minute Swansea's players took advantage of the numerical superiority.
Andre Ayew then raised the roof with a superb goal to secure Swansea a 1–0 victory.
Swansea leads 1-0 in the match, and the second game will take place next Wednesday at Brentford's home ground.
Without an ambassador for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the US Ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight of the media after CBS reported yesterday that he wanted to have an armed bodyguard as he feared for his life.
It has not been without difficulty for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador here in the country.
Since Carol Van Voorst left her post as ambassador of the United States in April 2009, the country has been without an ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned from office under special circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she was to receive the Falcon Award.
On her way to a farewell party with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the Presidential Office informing her that she would not be honored with the award.
After she left Iceland, she taught international relations at the Army War College.
Six months passed until Van Voorst's successor came to work, in September 2010.
It can to some extent be attributed to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as an ambassador but then resigned.
Finally, Louis Ariega took the job, having worked in the foreign service for decades.
He left his job in the fall of 2013 and took up the post of ambassador to Guatemala.
Then a second period without ambassadors began.
Robert Barber received approval from the US Congress in January 2015 and took office shortly thereafter, as no ambassador had been in place for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed, not a diplomat, but he had worked as a lawyer and a short-term election fund for Barack Obama.
He resigned from his post when Donald Trump took office as President on January 20th, 2017, as is customary with politically appointed ambassadors.
The Trump administration was unusually quick to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking officials to the government in Washington.
Two years passed until the United States Congress invited Jeffrey Ross Gunter to their meeting to question him on the interrogations and confirm that he had completed his mission as an ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony at the assembly, he said he had never been to Iceland but often to Western Europe, and his deceased wife had been from a Dutch mountain.
Gunter is politically organized, was formerly a dermatologist in California and has been prominent in Jewish organizations in the Republican Party, the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson founded the organization, and Adelson is a strong supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter started working in Iceland in May 2019, and at that time no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, two years and four months, which is the longest example here.
The reason is both how long the Trump administration was taking to appoint people to key positions as well as the fact that the work of the US Congress has been drawn out over the past years, including confirming ambassadors to office.
Since 2009, Iceland has been without an ambassador for about five years.
This has not prevented the activities of the embassy, which recently opened its headquarters at Engjateig.
The works have been estimated to have cost around 6.5 billion and thick security walls surround the building and bulletproof glass is in all windows.
It seems, however, that it has not been enough to secure the current ambassador, as he is said to fear for his life and has requested to be provided with armed protection.
Former IBV player was subjected to racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland."
Tonny Mawejje, a former player of IBV, claims to have experienced racism when he was in Iceland and that he still remembers coming to the country.
This is revealed in an interview with Tonny that appeared in the Ugandan media outlet Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the team Uganda Police FC which plays in the top division of Uganda.
In the interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time here in the country when he played with IBV, Val and Throti in Iceland.
When I came to Iceland I didn't play in the middle like I was used to playing.
The captain of the team was in that position, but in addition he also had the jersey number I wanted, so I got neither of what I wanted," says Tonny who played on the right side of the field during the game with IBV.
Among the things that Tonny talks about is racism that he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
"This once happened to me, but since I didn't understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later I heard more about the matter and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
He told me then that my opponent had made racist remarks about me after I tackled him.
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He admits to having made the mistakes he regrets the most.
Tonny had not been able to get into the starting lineup for Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan and then he joined forces with Val.
"It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan."
"I think that if I had been in Norway longer, I would have gotten the opportunity that I wanted," says Tonny, who was hoping that if he played well in Norway, he would likely get further.
He means that the loan to Iceland has put an end to his dreams of making it big in Europe.
A woman found a snake in her neck
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 cm long black snake in the throat of a woman who had come there for treatment.
The doctor was able to pull the worm out with tongs.
The investigation revealed that it was a reptile.
CNN reports on this.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days before, which are thin slices of meat.
The woman recovered quickly after the snake was removed, but reptiles like this are often found in raw meat or fish.
According to CNN, since sushi has become popular in the Western world, incidents involving venomous animals have increased.
Fear that another wave is starting in Europe
Spain is now in a state of emergency in response to concerns about a second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, and authorities have taken measures to contain the spread of the virus anew.
In Catalonia, all leisure activities have been put on hold for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also taken measures due to the increase in infections in Spain, and in Britain everyone must go into quarantine upon returning from Spain, like in Norway, and the French have been warned against travelling to Spain.
Cases are also increasing in France and Germany, where governments are trying to find a balance between containing the spread of the virus and restarting the economy.
The situation in Europe is still good compared to other parts of the world, but new infections worldwide are approaching 300 thousand per day, with the most cases in America and South Asia.
Confirmed cases of the virus have reached 16 million worldwide, according to the tally of Johns Hopkins University, and the confirmed deaths related to the virus have reached 644 thousand.
Mosaic work finally gets to enjoy itself to the fullest
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavík is a large and deep hole.
Above her are men with orange helmets.
There is also a big ditch.
And more small machines.
The street is closed to traffic.
The alleyway is crowded and many now stand there admiring the artwork made of millions of mosaic tiles - as if they had never seen it before.
Maybe they have never seen it before.
At least don't imagine it for yourself.
The work has been somewhat neglected up to this point, right in front of it were parking lots that were always busy.
People parked there, locked the car in a hurry and then left to attend to their business in the city center.
"Lively and diverse public space" and "inviting urban landscape" are guiding lights for the redevelopment of Tryggvagata which is now underway.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow Gerður Helgadóttir's mosaic work at the Tollhouse to be better appreciated.
In front of the work there will be a square and since the area is well suited to the sun, it is considered suitable as a resting area for travelers.
The artwork will be illuminated and now the material will enjoy itself better than before on this 142 square meter floor.
The area will also feature small "fog sculptures," a kind of water sculpture, which offer play and give the area a certain charm.
This approach describes the renovations of Reykjavik City Council in conjunction with Veitum.
Water, heat, and electricity utilities will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their years, but the school regulations and the cold water regulations are from 1925 and have therefore served the inhabitants and businesses in the city center for almost a century.
When the street is reopened after the works are completed, cars can drive on it again.
But it will still be unique and at the same time create calmer and more accessible spaces for pedestrians.
According to the website of the Customs Director, the Customs House was put into use in 1971 and its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Due to the harbor breeze passing through the house, 250 square meters of wall-to-wall carpeting was formed out to the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such additions would have a negative effect on the overall appearance of the house, unless special measures were taken to enhance the appearance of the house.
The parties agreed to consider installing a permanent artwork here.
At this time, much was said of Gerður Helgadóttir, an artist, according to the summary.
She had worked a lot on mosaic artworks in Germany and elsewhere.
It was decided to contact her first before deciding whether a competition for the work would be held.
It had often been said that the work should reflect life at the harbor, after all, the harbor had been the lifeblood of Reykjavik since it was built.
When the artist was spoken to, she was overwhelmed by such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she left the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerður got the time she decided she needed, and when she returned home she put forward some proposals for discussion.
It was unanimously agreed to ask her to do the work.
At the same time, a comprehensive agreement was sought with her and the famous artworks company in Germany, the Oidtmann Brothers, as Gerður had long been working with them to set up famous artworks throughout Europe.
Agreements were reached and Gerður won the artwork under the setup of the workshop of the brothers, who then took care of the setup of the Customs House.
The work was exceptionally well handled, both by Gerður Helgadóttir and Oidtmann Brothers, according to the summary.
It has since endured the unpredictable Icelandic weather.
It took Gerði about two years to complete the work, which was done and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The Lighthouse Lady died two years after the Customs House was completed, only 47 years old.
Preparing to move several foundations out of the country
Minister of Social Affairs Ásmundur Einar Daðason announces that more public institutions will be moved out of the city in the near future.
This was said by the minister in the show Sprengisandi on Bylgjan this morning.
Recently it was announced that the Housing and Employment Agency's debt collection department will be moved north to Sauðárkrók in the fall.
Six experts in the field of fire safety work for the organization, but none of them intend to follow the organization north and the National Association of Fire and Rescue Services has criticized the relocation of equipment.
I think we need to take further steps in this direction.
I am preparing further steps in this venture.
"More shipments," said Ásmundur.
He claims that a large majority of the nation wants to see more distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
"I think we need to take further political decisions about moving public services out to the countryside, like I was doing with the Housing and Employment Agency," said Ásmundur, and he also gave examples of other agencies that have been moved out to the countryside and made a big difference for communities out there, such as the relocation of the Food Agency to Selfoss, the Land Survey of Iceland to Akranes and unemployment benefits to Skagaströnd.
All the best from the last day of the Masters Tournament
The Icelandic Masters in Freestyle Sports concluded at Thorswell in Akureyri today.
Some records were set on the last competition day.
An exciting competition in women's shot put was held at Thorswell and Vigdis Jonsdottir from FH set an Icelandic record in shot put in 2014 which stood until Elisabet Rut Runarsdottir from IR improved the record in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic Championship back earlier this summer and has been in great form since then, having tripled the Icelandic Championship that was held this summer.
Elizabeth Rut has been wrestling with a sprain and was unable to make it to practice today.
She only had one good throw out of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the farthest of all today, 60.08 meters in her last attempt, and set a new record at the same time.
Her Iceland record was set earlier in July at 62.69 meters, so she was still somewhat away from it.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from ÍR had the second best throw of the day and she improved her best result with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's category, FH-ingurinn Hilmar Örn Jónsson, Iceland's representative in the hammer throw, won a decisive victory as he threw 73.84 meters in his second to last throw and set a new record.
His Iceland record in the event is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, an Olympic athlete and Iceland's representative in discus throwing, won a competition in shot put at Þórsvelli yesterday and today he competed in discus throwing which is his main event.
Iceland's Guðni Val's throw was 65.53 meters, but he threw the farthest at 59.13 meters today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second longest today with one valid throw of 49.43 meters, good enough for second place.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, Iceland's long jump champion, won the long jump competition with a remarkable performance; Hafdís jumped 6.25 meters today, which is almost 40 cm from her own Icelandic record.
In the 200 meter women's run, it was Icelandic athlete Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was the fastest, finishing in 24.04 seconds, although her Icelandic record in the event is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was successful in Akureyri yesterday, winning two gold medals in the 100 meter sprint and the 4 x 100 meter relay, and also in the 4 x 400 meter relay today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was first in the 200 meter race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Mána Samúelsson from Ármann.
Just like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 meter race yesterday as well as in the 400 meter race.
No penalty for a 27 million krona Bitcoin transaction
The appeals committee has rejected the claim of the tax investigator who demanded a sentence for a man for concealing his financial income which was derived from the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
The committee concluded that the tax investigator had not provided clear reasons why it was necessary to prosecute the man.
The committee's ruling states that the tax inspector concluded that the person had a valid basis for incorrect tax returns for the years 2016 and 2017.
He had mismanaged his financial gains which had come from the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin up to 27 million, either intentionally or due to gross negligence.
The sect punished the man for his arrogance.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
He agreed to have sold cryptocurrency for 27 million in 2016.
He had acquired it with a grant in the years 2009 and 2010 when such had been both easy and inexpensive with a regular home computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the cryptocurrency, the tax implementation due to such a sale had been very unclear and unpredictable.
It would not have been possible to expect that ordinary citizens would make sense of such regulations on tax returns.
He had not expected to get away with not paying tax on the profits and had declared his assets on the statement of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
He had asked both experts and the tax collector how this should be handled, but without success.
Then he concluded that he had to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started mining for Bitcoin.
He would have been in a worse position than others to understand complex rules that tax authorities had not formed a clear view of.
The man deemed it fair that his taxes for these two fiscal years be refunded and a penalty applied, but otherwise no punishment be made.
Then he reiterated that he had resided in Iceland and had paid taxes in the country since 2012.
He had never intended to escape his duties in an irresponsible manner.
The demand for payment would be from all sides and would plunge him into debt.
Brynjólfur arouses attention: "This man understands what football is."
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been highly regarded among people and also has aroused admiration due to his success in playing time with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max division.
Sparks will fly in the power line tonight when they take on IA in a live broadcast on Stöð 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur is given a red card due to four warnings during the game and therefore does not show up for the game with a new haircut as he has done in the games of the summer so far.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his shirt for the game against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
"I don't know who exactly he was paying with the payment, but speaking of character, it was better to try in the game.
He did not go into hiding.
He wants to get the ball every single time and if there was someone to even out this game then I thought he would do it or make it happen," said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max studio, when the conversation turned to Brynjólfi.
"I'm here for the people."
"It is sometimes difficult to understand in what position he is in.
He looks a bit to the left when the game is coming to an end, but he has a very free role in the team," said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Thorkell Máni Pétursson says Brynjólf is a real entertainer and is delighted to have such a colorful person in the team: "There is no doubt that this is character.
This is a fun type and I love it with the hair, and always being ready to meet and answer in conversations.
There are an incredible amount of people taken by him, who tell me that this man understands what football is.
I am an entertainer.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people and have fun with it."
People are reading the interviews with Brynjólf, people are paying attention and following what is next on his agenda.
"This man is just a genius," said Máni.
Player KR said he wants to leave the team - "I have been in contact with some teams in Division B."
Tobias Thomsen, a player for KR in the Pepsi Max division, appears to be on the way out from the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to go back home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported on the case.
Tobias wants to start the season in his home country but first he needs to terminate his contract with KR where the Danish division starts earlier than the Icelandic one.
"The group knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding," said Tobias in conversation with Bold.
"I have been in contact with some teams in the B-division and will likely switch before the Icelandic season ends.
"There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay off my contract with KR."
He then says that he needs to take a pay cut in Denmark in all likelihood.
"Groups in Denmark have probably been more affected by the virus's economic effects than in Iceland."
Bicycle bell-maker Bjartmar has recovered bicycles for millions - Now responds after discussion with DV
For many years, Bjartmar Leósson has had interests unlike most others.
He repairs and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned the nickname "the Bicycle Whisperer" for the week.
Yesterday there was a lot of buzz when someone shared their experience of their interactions with Bjartmar.
DV then brought up the discussion in the West End Facebook group where it was revealed that Bjartmar had spoken to the man at Austurvelli and suggested that the Vespa might be stolen.
Nothing else could be read from the original documents of the electrician except that Bjartmar had robbed him.
This text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original news from DV has been updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the initial reports of the incident do not accurately reflect what actually happened yesterday at Austurvellir.
Bjartmar said he had received information from the sacrificial lamb of the electric scooter tax that these were indeed their electric scooters.
The information the supposed owner received from others proved to be wrong, says Bjartmar.
"I looked at the cow and I recognized the scooter, and with information that there was an electric scooter that had been missing for a long time and had been sought after."
I certainly hesitated at first, but when I saw him prepare to leave on the boat, I decided to take the opportunity to talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his cause and so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
Generally I do very well in such matters, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken away my word.
Bjartmar says that the man with the skateboard had offered him to show him the receipt for the bike and had himself called the police.
"Yes, great," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this straightened out."
So the owner of the laptop confirmed ownership of his laptop and set off.
Later, the rightful owner of the laptop told his story on Facebook, as reported in the earlier news.
In this past year that Bjartmar has devoted to this skill of his, he claims to be able to count the changes he came up with on the tips of the fingers of the other hand.
"I have had peaceful interactions with the toughest people of Reykjavik," said Bjartmar, pointing out that cyclists are often the least brothers and sisters of society, addicts, mentally ill people, and other people who are on the street for some reason.
"Debt is a harsh master and somehow one has to finance the next bit, unfortunately theft of such loose funds is an easy way to that goal," says Bjartmar.
My interactions with this people are so good that I have brought many of the good people with me to the team.
"There are examples of people who have gone into treatment and taken responsibility for themselves and then come to me for help and support with what I'm doing," he says.
Generally, Bjartmar's interactions with cyclists are on courteous terms.
Some know of him and what he is doing and offer kindly to show him receipts, bicycle serial numbers and so forth.
Bicycle theft is a big problem that has been little discussed.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are even going so far as to direct people to talk to him about electric scooters.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with the previous news broadcast of DV and claims not to be some kind of self-appointed police in a personal quest for justice.
When asked if he is still not come to the high ice with his courage, and whether this is not primarily the task of the police, Bjartmar certainly says it is.
Of course the law requires this, but the reality of the matter is that the law is simply not fulfilling this.
For example, I have seen police officers driving away from a large swarm of scooters.
She is, quite frankly, powerless in these matters.
"When the law is not doing anything in this, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can achieve success in this category, then why not?" asks Bjartmar.
He claims to have achieved such success in riding his scooter that sometimes he runs into his "fellow riders" on the street who have just gotten their own Bjartmar scooters.
The meeting that Bjartmar has called for police assistance has come to pass that she simply does not show up.
“This is just not working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the owners of the bicycles' fault,” said Bjartmar and he finds it unfortunate that the victims of bicycle theft have to suffer from the lack of police action in this category of cases.
There is no disagreement about Bjartmar's success.
Stories can be found far and wide of people thanking Bjartmar for returning their possessions to them.
Bjartmar himself says he has long lost count of the number of bicycles he has delivered, but the amounts certainly run into millions, if not tens of millions.
There are electric cars, electric bikes, and electric scooters, but electric bikes can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works at a daycare and every weekend he works at a community center.
His passion for cycling is an unpaid work he does in his free time.
Pension funds and long shadows
2019 was a milestone year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Civil servants had indeed received pensions from the Danish king since the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund for civil servants was established, which eventually became a pension fund for all public servants.
The foundation of the current pension funds of general wage earners was then laid with collective bargaining agreements in the labor market in 1969, where it was stipulated that an employment-related pension fund with compulsory membership and full fund collection should be established from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were established based on these agreements and the pension system continued to grow after that.
The pension system for workers was not the only significant change that the labor movement of the 20th century achieved through its struggle.
Unemployment benefits had been obtained in a similar manner in the historic strike of 1955, and the unions also achieved some success in their demands for disability rights and a health fund, significant vacation rights, reduction of working hours, compensation in housing matters and other such matters of great importance.
All these rights were won through great and strenuous struggle, but proved, in retrospect, to be much more lasting and valuable compensation than the increase in wages that disappeared just as quickly in the inflation that characterized the period after the war and until 1990, as many remember.
The process of establishing public pension funds in 1969 was both lengthy and complicated.
Although people eventually agreed that the funds would be the property of the fund associations, the labor movement insisted that their boards should be composed of representatives of employers and fund associations equally.
In the following years after the establishment of the funds, the demand for a majority of the workforce in the management of the funds was often discussed in the wage associations, but it never managed to pass, and therefore we are still stuck with the unnatural arrangement that representatives of the fund companies are not in the majority in the management of the funds.
Article 36 of Law No. 129/1997 on pension security and the activities of pension funds discusses the investment policy of the funds.
The first article states that "the pension fund shall have the interests of the fund members as its guiding principle."
Furthermore, Article 5 states: "The pension fund shall set ethical criteria for its investments."
Among other provisions in the Lífeyrissjóðs Verslunarmanna pension scheme are the following, in accordance with the aforementioned legal provisions:
The pension fund is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), along with many of the largest pension funds and institutional investors in the Western Hemisphere and Europe.
The rules discuss how emphasis on environmental and social issues, in addition to good corporate governance, can contribute to improved performance of bond portfolios.
Thus, the interests of financial investors and the goals of society as a whole are reconciled.
It is important for companies, especially those listed on the stock exchange, to set a public policy: to practice good corporate governance, social responsibility and environmental issues.
The pension fund Gildi, which is one of the largest funds in the country, has set a "policy of responsible investments" and there are provisions of similar nature.
This is all laid out here as an introduction to the newest Icelandic buzzword, "shadow governance".
Where the word is new to the language, it is not expected to have been defined to satisfaction, but the following definition now seems to be the "most taken": Shadow governance is when a leader of a corporate entity tells the media that they intend to send representatives of the company to the board of a pension fund with recommendations or instructions on how they should take a stance on a particular issue.
If they do not follow the instructions, they will be removed from the administration at the first opportunity.
If the leader does not take this to the media and does not talk about resignation, then it is not "shadow government" after all, as such communication between people is of course always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I leave it to the reader to ponder which path he finds "more shadowy."
There are mainly two people who have tried to define this when it is written, on Saturday morning July 25th 2020.
They are Hörður Ægisson, a journalist at Fréttablaðið, and Ásgeir Jónsson, a bank manager.
The occasion for both was after Bogi Nils Bogason, the director of Icelandair, had announced his plan to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and flight attendants (dismiss them), and Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, chairman of the Reykjavik Trade Union, sent out those suggestions to the company's representatives on the Trade Union Pension Fund Board to not support any possible purchase of the fund's shares in the company, or they might be forced to resign.
A few days later, Bogi Nils reversed his decision and Ragnar Thor followed suit with his recommendation, which was obviously based on Bogi's decision.
In the end, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to elaborate on the matter in the Friday edition of Fréttablaðið with big words about shadow government, lawbreaking and the great need for changes in the laws.
There was a small tuft that had to really struggle with a heavy burden, even though the blessed tuft had been in a state of connection and in addition had been dried out quickly.
As language is important, let us pay attention to the subject itself in the end.
I mentioned here before the provisions in the pension fund laws that relate to this matter.
This implies that fund managers must take into account the interests of fund members and have ethical considerations in investments, and these points are elaborated further in the resolutions of both the Trade Union and the Pension Fund, as I mentioned.
Pension funds, on the other hand, MUST NOT only look at short-term profit targets in their investments.
Such would be a highly risky policy and one does not need to look far for examples of such in the past, where large loans from banks and funds have been given to irresponsible adventurers and environmentalists, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on high ice when it occurred to him to lay off a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position vis-à-vis investors.
As it turned out, he took care of himself and drew this back.
Time will tell whether investing pension funds in the company can be considered responsible towards the fund members when it comes to the crunch.

One of the infected did not have a homecoming test
One of the three people who tested positive for Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived in the country from the Baltic States on July 15th, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who is not resident here by default and therefore did not receive clear instructions to follow the so-called homecoming test after arriving in the country and go for another test a few days after arrival.
He got a negative response from the border patrol.
"He is in the Icelandic society and in reality had to go into that solution," says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, an expert in the health protection department of the National Health Service and the substitute health protection doctor while he is on summer vacation, in an interview with Fréttablaðið today.
"He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the ID number and if the ID number is not registered then you are not automatically invited to the second show."
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually living abroad, but due to his connection to the country as an Icelander he should have rather used the Icelandic one.
He hadn't realized this.
When your national identification number is not registered, you need to take the initiative to take the later exam.
"Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that it was the right way," says Kamilla.
Thus it is clear that we need to increase the information about this while we find some way to make an automatic booking system even though Icelanders do not register their ID numbers.
"Or make it somehow clearer who the participants in the Icelandic society in the registration system are," she explains.
As far as possible, the person in question should be welcomed upon arrival to the country, even if they are defined as a participant in Icelandic society, being an Icelander.
Only six have been sent to quarantine after he was diagnosed yesterday and these six were all in close contact with him.
They are supposed to go for a checkup but two of them have already shown signs of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative result from his test at the border on July 15th.
Kamilla says it is likely that he had recently been infected with the virus that it had not yet been able to be detected in him when the sample was taken at the border.
She does not want to exclude the possibility that the man has been infected here in Iceland and not brought the virus with him to the country.
“It is not entirely possible to maintain that this is definitely an imported infection, since it has been so long since he arrived in the country that he could have been exposed here, like these two who have caused some commotion in relation to the sports event.”
She says it's very unlikely because of how few people are around here.
"It's actually very unlikely," says Kamilla, adding that it can't be ruled out until Icelandic genetic testing has sorted out the virus in the person.
"If we get a virus type that has not been seen here before, it is almost certain that it has been brought into the country."
Pepper spray and stun grenades used against protesters
A confrontation occurred between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
The police used pepper spray and rubber bullets against the protesters, but the protesters broke windows and set fires.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police brutality and racial injustice were widely protested in the United States yesterday evening, with the protests in Seattle in support of the protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot dead.
According to the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
Thousands gathered in Seattle for peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a construction site and broke windows at the city courthouse.
Subsequently, the police declared the protests to be disorderly and clashes broke out between the protesters and the police.
Justice is demanded in Aurora, Colorado, for Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was killed by police in August of last year, remembered by protesters.
The car drove through a group of protesters in the city but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of members of the National Guard of Black people gathered and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman who was killed by police in her home in March last year.
The group carried firearms and marched in formations to closed alleyways where the police forced the group away from a group of people protesting the protests and also carried firearms.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was killed by a white business owner in May.
Solskjaer: Not the game that defines our period
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, manager of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of today's game against Leicester in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea does not lose against Wolves, then Solskjær and his men will end up in 5th place and miss out on a Champions League spot.
Then they still had hope of getting into the Master Division by winning the European Division next month.
We are not at the end yet.
"If we get points against Leicester I think people will say that we haven't had a bad period," said Solskjær.
"No matter what happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot to do to catch up with the two teams above us," said Solskjær.
It is clear that the teams will meet at 3 pm today, but Solskjær tried to act as if it were any other game.
If you want to be part of Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and society is built on this.
"We have created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it is up to us to take advantage of it," said Solskjær.
"This is not the most important game of the season, this is just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the soccer team, the next game is always the most important.
"The results do not define our era, we have already had many moments that define this era."
"Bruno Fernandes has changed a lot for us and I think that overall we are in better shape and stronger mentally than last season," said Solskjær.
65,000 suns around the horizon
65,490 new cases of the coronavirus were reported in the United States yesterday according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 cases of infection have been confirmed in the West since the outbreak began in the country.
900 died due to the virus yesterday and in the last four days the death toll due to the virus was more than 1,000 per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to a CNN report, the US health authorities predict that the number of deaths from the virus will reach 175,000 by August 15th.
Fear the other wave of the tide
The authorities in Spain are now trying with weak measures to contain the increased spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19 on both Thursday and Friday.
There have been no more outbreaks in a solar cycle since the beginning of May and the news comes at the same time as the Spanish begin to relax one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe.
The backlash led to British authorities now requiring passengers coming from Spain to go into quarantine upon arrival.
Previously, Spain was on the British list of safe countries.
The situation is worst in Catalonia in the northeast of Spain where the authorities have taken more extensive measures to try to contain the spread.
In the capital city of Barcelona, amusement parks will be closed for the next two weeks and nightclubs will be closed at midnight.
Then the exit ban is now in effect for 200 thousand inhabitants in the Segria district in the western part of Catalonia.
It is said that the British decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly affected by the pandemic.
TUI, the largest travel agency in Britain, has cancelled all flights scheduled for today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the pandemic, but there seems to be little interest in reimposing a widespread lockdown that has put the economy into a slump.
For example, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken a very dim view of such things as nuclear weapons which he does not want to use.
Then Jean Castex, the French Prime Minister, said that the nation "would not survive, economically or socially," if a nationwide curfew were imposed again.
Many advisors hope that local measures that target individual towns, cities, or regions will be enough to contain the virus if it returns in the next round.
Five new cases in Iceland - Three domestic
Three domestic cases were identified yesterday in addition to two additional cases at the border.
Five individuals tested positive for Covid-19 yesterday in Iceland.
In a public health announcement it is said that one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football match.
He has been quarantined and sixteen people who were in close contact with him have been quarantined as well.
He was a participant in the social activities of a sports club in Reykjavik and according to the announcement, "only members of the sports team" were infected.
Others who were sent to quarantine are connected to the man in a different way.
The origin of this infection is unknown and contact tracing is underway by the contact tracing team of the National Police Commissioner.
The organizers of the ReyCUP tournament have followed the guidelines and regulations of the health and safety authorities that are still in effect and appropriate measures have been taken.
Although pictures of the match yesterday attracted attention where it could be seen in very close proximity to celebrate the good performance of their team on the field.
Right before 11 o'clock today, the organizers released the following announcement on their Facebook page.
Please note: Parents, please respect the rule that competitors must bring their own equipment to school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do that.
"Thank you for your understanding."
Another infection was identified yesterday that is related to the infection reported the day before.
The announcement states: "Icelandic genetic testing has identified the infection and revealed a new type of virus that has not been identified here before."
An infection is being treated in that matter as well and the infected person is in isolation and 12 in quarantine due to the infection.
The third infection in question is from a person who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, on July 15th.
He was diagnosed in the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
Two of them have already begun to show symptoms of the virus.
In addition, two were identified at the border and the results of further investigations, such as the work process in relation to the border, are awaited.
Finally, the announcement states: The National Security Division of the National Police Commissioner and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer urge people to be vigilant and adhere to individual protective measures against infection.
Exercise the least doubt as to whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present when the same person is asked to go for a check-up at the nearest health center.
Patreksfjörður says the campsite is booked up for the merchants' weekend - No more guests allowed.
The campsite in Patreksfjörður is fully booked for the weekend, according to the announcement of Vesturbyggðar.
Guests are encouraged to explore other accommodation options.
We name Vesturbyggð Bíldudal, Tálknafjörð, Melanes at Rauðasandi, Hótel Flókalund and Hótel Breiðavík as other options in the area.
There is plenty to do in Patreksfjordur this weekend, as Skjaldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentary films, will be held in the town, just like previous years.
She has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the town.
Judging by the turnout at the campsite, one can expect a good turnout this year, if the weather doesn't put a damper on things, as DV reported earlier today from a related forecast.
We must still prepare for the worst weather to the south, and hope for the best for the people of Patreksfjörður.
The website bb.is was the first to report it, and said that all other accommodations in the town were already fully booked.
An entire apartment building collapses down to the best spot in the city.
Romanian workers live free at Dunhaga 18-20.
While owners are applying for building permits for renovations, their applications have been increasing in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, greenest, and most expensive neighborhoods of Reykjavik stands a beautiful three-story apartment building.
On the ground floor of the house there is about 600 square meters of retail space.
Behind the house are two staircases each containing four quite pleasant apartments.
They are between 93-130 meters long, although most are over 100.
The house has a considerable history to keep.
It was built in 1959 and has housed a video rental store, a shoe store, a dairy store of the Milk Association, Joa's shoe repair shop, a fish store, and most recently the University Press.
The house, so to speak, has remembered its beautiful past.
The house is now under great damage, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 Ltd.
The owners of D18 ehf. are, among others, Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir, according to the company register.
Magnus went before the Borgunar ownership group and was a defender of the Borgunar asset management company.
Among the owners of the asset management company Borgunar is Stálskip ehf.
Stálskip ehf. is an investment company owned by Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún is also an owner of a third share in D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once owned the Stálskip company.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has since done little to nothing to maintain it.
Neighbors say that the condition of the house has been deteriorating steadily since, especially in recent years.
On the Facebook page of the residents of the neighborhood, one resident says that the house has "not been particularly lively in recent years".
Owners have been trying for a few years to change the house and the plot.
Other neighbors say the house has not been in good condition for a long time.
"It is long overdue to do something about this mess and it is unfortunate that it has dragged on for so long."
He also says that he is angry with the owners of the house for not having driven himself to finish this, finding some common ground with the neighbors of the house and ending this "legal quagmire".
"Do this only in consultation with the community around so that it can be driven in and completed."
The "Legal Gap" referred to is the organizational process of the court that has been ongoing since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then applied for permission to build a storey on top of the existing apartment building and behind the house, a new lift house and an extension of one storey plus a basement.
The building permit that was granted for the project was appealed to the Environmental and Natural Resources Board and the board invalidated it as the project did not have support in the zoning regulations and the boundary survey was not sufficient.
Reykjavik City then began a competitive bidding process and concluded it with an announcement in the Government Gazette in July last year.
The arrangement was also beloved and the committee invalidated it in March 2020.
At this point, nearly three years had passed since the original application for a building permit and the owners of the house were at the starting point.
The house had at this time deteriorated significantly and the neighbors were beginning to tire.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house about the situation, the neighbors' responses were varied.
Some had an understanding of the owners' plans, others not at all.
Some directed the wagon towards the city, others did not.
Others were just angry but nothing really out of the ordinary.
Others said the parking lot was crowded, but neighbors have used the unused parking lot of Dunhaga 18-20 for their vehicles.
One plaintiff in the case claimed to be exhausted by the administration:
"It's unbelievable that we have to go through the process in three stages."
It's like Reykjavík City can't read.
Today the house stands empty, abandoned and neglected.
A monument to the civic governance of the city and the generous plans of the owner and the many years of work that is now at the starting point.
When the journalist arrived at the Dunhaga 18 gate, the doors opened and a stampede of people rushed out.
A Playstation console and a recent television lay among the other trash on the ground — the remains of an Icelandic summer cottage.
The old office of the University Press was open and there were quite a few cats of the local breed to judge.
It is clear that someone has made a mess in one corner but nothing visible.
Stacks of pillows and rooms and some sheets of geology papers, which surely should have been a book, rustled.
The stairwells of the apartment building were simultaneously open and lively.
The journalist was so lucky to run into one of the inhabitants.
The Romans were boiling potatoes for dinner and invited a journalist in.
The employees work for the staffing agency Ztrongforce Ltd.
They have been there for some time and sources from DV claim that the company has not paid for the accommodation except for heating and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not defensible to collect rent.
Judging by the post boxes in the front door of the house, it is clear that there has been a number of foreign workers living there in recent months.
The labor leasing industry has not been spared from the Covid-19 situation, as the downturn in tourism has led to a downturn in the construction sector and these two sectors have been the most active in using labor leasing services.
The residents of Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty to do and the work tools and equipment hung in the community for drying after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the sad state of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be in excellent condition.
When the journalist greeted the Romanian boys, the coldness was quickly made clear to him: On the best spot in Reykjavik stands a 1500 square meter property down payment.
The owners want to renovate the house for improvement and the neighbors want to improve the condition but disagree on the definition of "improvement".
Between them sits the city's planning department at the starting point, providing endless avenues of appeal and complaint in the planning process and the resolution of the Environmental and Natural Resources Board.
In the house live Romanian workers, maybe even those who go to improve the situation when the Icelanders stop rioting.
The article was originally published in the Sunday newspaper DV on July 17.
In response to the burden of the coronavirus pandemic
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will provide 10 million pounds for a campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on junk food advertising, following his serious illness, partly due to his weight.
Johnson is scheduled to launch the campaign, dubbed Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, and with the campaign doctors will be encouraged to prescribe bicycles for their patients with obesity and additional measures will be taken to increase the number of bike paths.
Advertising for fast food will be banned on television after 9 pm, according to British media sources.
“COVID-19 has awakened us to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Minister of Finance is determined that we use the time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier food,” said a government spokesman.
Johnson has himself struggled with weight issues, and he was hospitalized when he contracted the coronavirus in the spring, and it is partly due to his weight that he is thought to have become so seriously ill.
Women are better suited to lead the changes.
She said that the new constitution was the biggest step the nation could take towards greater democracy, efficiency, and working against corruption and for the benefit of the whole.
"We need to start making some changes now and who is better suited to lead such changes than the group of society that has an easier time being in these values."
"There are women," said Helga.
Women in Iceland are famous for their women's solidarity.
Standing together and being together to lead change.
So now it's up to us to implement these changes.
She said she was somewhat uncomfortable with the emphasis on Iceland as "the best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
"Then we are not equally prepared to examine what needs to be done.
Just like Germans, Icelanders are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
It is a slope.
We must know where we come from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the advice of established groups.
"We don't all live by the same rules here," said Helga.
She said that women are in a good position in Iceland, but added that, as elsewhere, Icelandic people are still largely influenced by patriarchal values.
She said that politics turned to serve their own interests, power and control that were the forces that maintained injustice in all societies.
"Women have now established this group and come together and are just a little bit excited that the Althing is likely to ignore this national referendum from 2012," she said.
"These are the feminine values that we are thinking this out from.
"From human rights and nature conservation, cooperation and that we all sit at the same table," she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the fundamental values in the new government charter.
We are a very wealthy country of natural resources and it is remarkable that there are people here living in poverty.
"It's amazing, we can change things," said Helga.
It is outrageous that there is a natural law that women's work is always paid less.
It is outrageous that flight attendants and nurses have to constantly fight for fair wages.
It is possible to sign the petition for the new constitution here through digital Iceland.
Tried to rob a pedestrian in the city center
A man was arrested in the city center last night after he assaulted a pedestrian and attempted to take money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Árbær where two were arrested for the case.
Then the police stopped the motorcyclist in Hlíðunum where the driver was going at 146 km/h where the speed limit is 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driving privileges.
The police in the capital area had plenty to do last night and approximately 80 cases were recorded in the police log from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was a lot of hype around compliance announcements.
On Saturday night, reports of eleven loud gatherings were received and it seemed like a lot to the police log.
Tonight, 22 cases of vandalism were reported to the police.
Six were detained in a jail cell last night.
The police were called to the suburbs last night when parties fired fireworks into the sky.
They were, however, prepared to defend themselves when the police officer arrived at the gate.
Then nine drivers were stopped for alcohol and/or drug testing.
Four were arrested for a fight in the city center last night and one of them was detained in a jail cell.
Then two were rushed to the emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the city center and the other in the West End.
One person was taken to the emergency department after he injured himself while jumping on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped a motorist who drove a car on Kjalarnes yesterday.
According to the police log, the bicycle equipment of the cyclist was in "very poor condition" and it was neglected.
It is possible to stay in Monet's house during the weekend of the merchants.
The house that Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life in is now available for rent on Airbnb.
The next free nights in the house are around the merchants' holiday.
The house is small and quaint, located in the village of Givenry in Normandy in France.
The famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until he died in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two living rooms, and three bathrooms.
Many people were first inspired to paint their famous gardens in this house.
If anyone intends to rent the house, they must rent it for at least two nights.
According to the Airbnb page, it's almost free after the weekend of the merchants' holiday, so it might be a good option for some merchants on vacation to book the painter's house.
Two nights over the weekend of the merchants cost no more than 964 US dollars or roughly 130 thousand Icelandic kronur according to the newspaper.
Some people have been tested positive for the coronavirus and some of them are showing symptoms of the disease.
Five have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
Some people have come down with the illness caused by the virus and some of them have started to show symptoms of the disease.
Three tested positive for the coronavirus domestically yesterday and two at the border crossing.
An expert at the National Health Institute says that an increasing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading further into the community.
It has been traced back to the previous domestic infection and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to believe that it has been circulating in the community at any time.
This is probably something new to the country but of course we need to be very vigilant now," said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, an expert in the field of disease control at the Ministry of Health.
Most of those infected have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
Further tests are taking place in the near future and some who were in contact with the infected are beginning to show symptoms of coronavirus.
"Now that there is no flu season and fewer other respiratory illnesses, we can be somewhat flexible with doing these tests on individuals who during flu season would have had reason to do something else first," said Kamilla.
The quarantine is mostly over, but it is not ruled out that more people may need to go into quarantine.
Two of the infected recovered after attending a sports event.
It has raised questions whether it is defensible to hold such events.
The public safety manager says it is very possible as long as people follow the guidelines and rules.
Kamilla almost says it is impossible that the infected have been infected at the sports events.
If no more people go into isolation from these individuals after having interacted with them at these sports events, then we can conclude that our preventive measures at the events have been effective.
"And that hasn't come to light," said Kamilla.
The work of the public defense department should be in constant review.
"We need to be prepared to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems appropriate," said Kamilla.
After a long week, the crowd limit is being increased to a thousand people.
This new position could have an impact on resignations.
"A determined contemplation to cook" - See Elisa Viðar's menu
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is a footballer and plays for Val.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, a mother, and works as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for the day's work and usually takes time to cook a good and nutritious meal.
"A typical day for me starts with going to work at eight," says Elisa.
"After work I go to the store to prepare dinner before I pick up my daughter from preschool at three o'clock."
Elísu finds it very rewarding to pick up her daughter early from preschool.
"It's good to have time with her before I go to my second workout."
After exercising, it's good to come home and just have to heat up the food.
In the evening, when the girl is asleep, we find it good to watch one episode to empty our minds.
Elisa does not follow any particular diet.
She is finishing her master's thesis in nutrition and knows well what suits her to eat to have enough energy to work, school, family and exercise.
What suits me is to eat a varied diet that is well balanced with proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.
I think it is most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not categorize food as bad or good, rather nutrient-rich or nutrient-poor.
"It's perfectly fine to eat everything, just not all at once and not all the time."
Elisa has a very strong interest in firefighting.
"I find a certain contemplation in standing in the kitchen cooking and I really enjoy it."
I have to say that my self-confidence is with me in the kitchen and I sincerely believe that I am a good cook.
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little citrus juice, let it soak in almond milk overnight.
Top off this meal with whatever is available each time.
Usually it's banana and granola & COFFEE.
I am a big coffee lover.
Snack: Incredibly varied, but fruits or vegetables, pancakes, plain skyr with banana and muesli, bread with toppings and then I could eat hummus with a spoon out of the box if that's the way it goes.
Lunch: I often make a variety of meals from what is in the fridge, quinoa or bulgur, falafel balls, lettuce salad, oven-baked vegetables with a good dressing is what I'm working with.
If the schedule goes completely off the rails (which often happens) then the egg machine in the workplace has come to my rescue quite often and then it's two slices of bread with butter, cheese and boiled egg, don't put any more on you.
Request: Get me something carbohydrate-rich for exercise, bread with topping, muesli or fruit.
Dinner: Fish is often chosen for my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Conflict between police and protesters in Seattle
Authorities in Seattle, Washington have declared a state of emergency following large protests in the downtown area.
Yesterday, the police took to tear gas and pepper spray to try to clear a large area that protesters had taken over and stretched across several city blocks near the parliament building in the city.
The police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into vandalism at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly involving some kind of explosion.
City and police authorities say that protesters have pelted police with stones, bottles, firecrackers and other loose objects and one police officer was taken to the hospital where his injuries were treated.
The protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
The blast was to show solidarity with the protesters in Portland, Oregon, where there has been an ongoing confrontation between protesters and heavily armed federal law enforcement officers.
There, like in many other cities in the United States, people are gathering under the banner of Black Lives Matter, commemorating George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25th, protesting systemic racism in American society and demanding reform.
Not to be revoked until after a vote
It is still not clear whether the layoffs of Icelandair employees, which are due to take effect in the next month, will be reversed.
The electronic voting on the collective agreement of the Icelandic Flight Attendants Association on behalf of the flight attendants of Icelandair will end at noon tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, the chairman of the association, is certain that Icelandair will not make a decision on the layoffs until the results of the vote are in.
"This clearly hangs together," says Guðlaug Líney.
No layoffs have been reversed, this has to be done so that the machines can be manned.
So people are obviously anxious to find out whether they will have a job after the month-end.
An agreement was signed last week, on the night of July 19th.
It is expected that he will remain in office until the end of September 2025, based on an agreement that the pilots had previously voted on.
On July 17th, the board and trustees of Icelandair approved a general strike, which was approved by the members in a vote.
She never came, and this was decided following Icelandair's decision to end negotiations with the Flight Attendants Union, terminate all of their flight attendants, and seek agreements with another union.
Then the airline's pilots had to take on the role of security officers temporarily.
Guðlaug Líney says it is difficult to say how the vote will go when asked.
People are in distress after this announcement from Icelandair, when all of the airline's employees were laid off and informed that an agreement would be made with another company.
Now it becomes clear whether it has an effect," she says.
940 flight attendants worked for Icelandair at the end of April, but then 900 of them, about 95%, were laid off.
Their notice period is misaligned, for those with the shortest employment it is three months and ends around the July-August month end.
In that group, there are about 90% of Icelandair flight attendants.
What happens if the contract is not approved?
"Then we wish for continued dialogue with our counterparts.
With this agreement, we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
"It is clear that he should be rejected, as the flight attendants have gone too far."
The vote on the collective agreement ends and Icelandair will announce the annual results tomorrow.
The vote on the new contract for the flight attendants will end at 12 o'clock tomorrow morning.
Icelandair's results for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, and the preliminary results indicate that the company's revenues have decreased by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The electronic voting on the collective agreement between the Flight Attendants Association of Iceland and the Confederation of Icelandic Employers on behalf of Icelandair began on Wednesday, July 22nd and will end tomorrow, Monday, July 27th at 12 noon.
Those who can choose about the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay union dues to the Flight Attendants Union.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new collective agreement on Sunday night, July 19th, after Icelandair had broken off negotiations with the union earlier that Friday, following the flight attendants' rejection of the previous agreement in a vote at the beginning of July.
Icelandair had told all its flight attendants and crew members on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new collective agreement was signed.
According to the new collective agreement, flight attendants must fly five hours more per month for the same basic salary.
The agreement is valid until the year 2025 and provisions have been made for pilots and flight attendants regarding how long one shift can fly.
The agreement was presented to the members of FFÍ at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday and many flight attendants who the news agency spoke to expressed dissatisfaction with the agreement.
Most people agreed that the agreement should be accepted in order to keep the Icelandic Football Association alive.
Icelandair's results for the second quarter will be announced tomorrow, and the company's EBIT, operating income for financial and tax purposes, is expected to be negative by 100 to 110 million US dollars or 15 billion Icelandic krona according to preliminary results.
Icelandair sent Kauphöllinni an urgent invoice last Wednesday, saying that the company's revenue had decreased by 60 million dollars, or about 8.3 billion krona.
Portable money and its equivalent have been around 154 million US dollars at the end of the quarter, around 21 billion krona.
Icelandair is still aiming to offer a share of the company's stock in August.
Icelandair is aiming to complete agreements with fifteen lenders, governments, and Boeing aircraft manufacturer by the end of the month before going into a debt offering.
A new variant rather than a new species
"A new era means only that this has been an individual who came from abroad.
"This is not something that has been circulating domestically," says Már Kristjánsson, chief physician at the Infectious Diseases Department of Landspítalinn, about the news that "a new strain of virus" has been identified in the country.
Three domestic cases were identified yesterday and two at the border.
Someone who tested positive had participated in the social activities of the sports club at the Rey Cup football match, but the origin of the infection is unknown and the spread of the infection is still ongoing.
Additionally, an infection was detected in an individual who arrived in the country on July 15th and two people who were in contact with him have begun to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Yesterday, a case of infection was identified that is related to the infection reported the day before, and after testing by the Icelandic Genetics Institute, it was revealed that it is a "new strain of virus that has not been identified here before."
Containment is over in relation to that infection.
It is now clear that this is not a new virus, but the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more appropriate to talk about a new variety of the virus rather than a new species of virus.
Asked what it means and whether it could say something about another wave of migration, Már says that as it is, it is a single case and it could be that nothing more comes of it.
"On the other hand, if cases arise domestically that are not related to foreign sources and have the same genetic makeup as this particular strain, then it would be possible to draw the same conclusion [about the second wave], but it is too early to do so," Már explains.
Luck in the hot pot
Is the secret to Icelandic happiness hidden in the hot pots?
BBC schedulers lead to a humorous video that sheds light on Iceland's hot spring and geothermal culture.
Icelandic bathing culture is unique in the world and it is said that nowhere in the world are there as many baths per inhabitant.
Natural geothermal energy is the basis of this, as well as the tradition of geothermal utilization that prevails here.
Education about the sun was legally mandated in 1940, but older citizens are no less eager to use the hot water for health benefits.
Vacations are described as an integral part of the country's general welfare.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class or status.
People communicate on a personal level through phones or enjoy the power of water, such as thoughts and currents that charge the soul and body.
It's a steep climb to get a hundred days in the elections.
One hundred days remain until Americans go to the polls and elect a president for four years.
Donald Trump is running for re-election but he has an uphill battle to fight.
Joe Biden, the expected Democratic candidate, has a large lead over Trump nationally, according to polls.
According to a new poll from AP news, a majority of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track.
Trump's response to the new coronavirus pandemic is similarly very unpopular and, in addition, more Americans than ever before believe that the president has handled economic matters poorly.
Only two out of every ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump's response to the pandemic and 48 percent say he has done well on economic matters.
In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to FiveThirtyEight's average, Biden has 49.9 percent support nationwide while Trump has 41.9 percent support.
Trump himself has tried to shift the focus from his stance on immigration to Biden, emphasize so-called culture wars and propose policies that should adhere to laws and regulations.
Biden's offer puts a lot of effort into keeping the focus on Trump and counts on a good chance of winning if the election is really about how Trump has performed in office in the last four years.
Trump's unpopularity seems to be targeting Republican congressmen as well, and Democrats fear they could even gain a majority in the House of Representatives, which until now has seemed highly unlikely.
The politician said today that the alignment of parties and candidates is similar and that the Republican Party will now receive its greatest setback in decades.
The suburbs have proven particularly unfavorable in the 2016 elections and now it looks like that trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to intimidate residents of suburbs to follow him, among other things by saying that if Biden becomes president, he will ruin the suburbs of the United States and promote gender divisions.
Among other things, Trump has overturned a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in the workforce.
Then he encouraged "housewives" to read an article by the former New York Deputy Secretary, where she argued that Biden would eliminate the US suburbs and Trump endorsed it.
"Biden will restore your communities and the American dream.
"I will preserve it, and even make it even better!" said the president.
Residents outside the United States are an ever-growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of votes from this group has become president.
Except for 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority of votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Polls have shown that despite Trump securing a narrow majority in the 2016 election, his support there has significantly decreased.
Although there is a difference between polls, Biden has spoken with a lead of about fifteen percent over Trump in the elections recently.

A number of collaborators, friends, and admirers have celebrated his work on social media over the past year.

After the final decision had been taken to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that only world wars have interrupted until now, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic flame would be "the light at the end of the tunnel," presumably referring to the global coronavirus pandemic that the world is now going through together.
Travellers have an extra year to prepare themselves and the authorities in Japan incur additional costs due to the delay.
Everyone holds a house, after all, much in a hat.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for the Olympic Games this year, the Japanese delegates were overwhelmed with joy.
They cheered and laughed in turn, as Tokyo had applied to host the 2016 games but it was decided to hold them at a lower level for Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan should draw the world's attention.
The games were supposed to take place from July 24th to August 9th but have been postponed for a year and will now start on July 23rd 2021 and end on August 8th.
If it is not possible to hold the games, if the coronavirus threat is still too great, the games will be cancelled.
No one really wants to think that thought through to the end.
The Olympic Games are no ordinary sporting competition.
Nothing is to be spared, the show must always be grand and strive to top the last performance.
The selection of the host city for the Olympic Games is based on the evaluation of the committee on the presentations of the cities.
The more elaborate the presentation is, the more likely it is to receive the reward.
Tokyo spent 150 million dollars in an attempt to host the 2016 Olympics, which is roughly equivalent to 20 billion krona.
The second time the 2020 games were applied for, 75 million dollars, around ten billion krona, were put into the promotion.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would host the games that year, Japanese authorities had already allocated a budget of 30 billion krona for the project.
That amount is just a drop in the ocean compared to what it costs to build an Olympic village, sports facilities and generally strengthen the infrastructure of the country to host such an event, prepare for it and hold the games themselves.
Planners in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be underway this days but have been postponed for one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.
In a report from the state auditor in Japan released at the end of last year, it was still evident that the cost was nearly double the amount.
It is likely not possible to put an exact cost on postponing the games, but it has been estimated that it could cost an additional two to six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between 15 and 30 billion dollars.
The numbers are so high that all Icelandic state taxes only covered about half of the Olympics, based on the lowest possible cost.
The Olympic Games are an event of such magnitude that they have often been the subject of discussion among economists, who try to analyze the numbers and examine the benefits and costs of the games.
It appears that many have come to the conclusion that the effects of the Olympic Games are less positive than expected for the economies of the cities that host them.
Short-term effects are some, for example, many jobs increase significantly in the short term, but in the long term cities often remain with debt burden and high operating costs of little used human resources.
Rio de Janeiro in Brazil is facing significant debt due to the 2016 Olympics and has been struggling to maintain all the major sports facilities that were built for the games.
An analysis of the numbers after the London 2012 games has revealed that only 10 percent of those who got jobs related to the Olympics in the city were unemployed before.
That means there were no new jobs except to a small extent.
Generally, cities have not fared particularly well financially from hosting Olympic Games due to the exorbitant costs associated with the infrastructure built for the games.
Although the reward is often considered to be hidden in the increased traffic of tourists wanting to visit the Olympic cities as a result of the games, there is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the 2021 games.
It is also uncertain whether it will be possible to accommodate all the large number of spectators who usually attend the games.
Honor is the main currency that cities strive to be chosen, but it is difficult to measure in terms of money.
Despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the players bring is not of such a nature that it can be priced.
Although the show is generously generous and nowhere to save, this is obviously not just about money.
It is the athletes who are in the foreground.
For some travelers, it's just a pleasant surprise to postpone the games.
Australian pentathlete and gold medalist at the Olympics, Chloe Esposito, for example, is a caselot and would have been far from good fun this summer, but she hopes to be in competition form for the 2021 games.
She is one of those athletes who is just rather pleased with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For the athletes who had planned to retire after the games this year, if they had been held on time, the postponement of the games in some cases means that they will retire before the games take place.
Do not trust your body simply to go through a year of intense workouts.
Few athletes came as close to capturing the hearts of the spectators at the 2016 Rio Olympics as gymnastics star Simone Biles.
She came home with four golds around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has attended several interviews in his home country the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She plans to compete in the 2021 games but she is not necessarily sure that she will be at the top of the games next year, as she will be 24 years old then.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is higher for a female athlete in the front row.
"This is a sensitive issue," says Biles, but she quickly moves on to another topic in an interview that was published on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page, asking if she intends to achieve the same results at the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.
"I honestly don't know if I'll still be at the top after a whole year of extra training," says Biles.
She has previously spoken about her body not being able to handle the strain that comes with intense exercise for much longer.
She is training hard for the 2021 Olympics.
We acknowledge that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to suddenly stop exercising when the pandemic was at its peak and the gym was closed.
No exceptions were made for Bale rather than others while all sportsmen were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold couldn't buy her any access beyond that, she had to find various ways to keep herself in shape like the others.
The basic form certainly looks better than most people's.
We have a strict plan now.
It was difficult to start exercising again after the gym reopened.
We started slow but we are now in full swing for the new year and I will increase the exercises regularly as the year progresses.
Of course, we don't know exactly how these games will be or if they will be held, but we are still preparing as if they will be, we can't do anything else.
"I have put too much into this sport to give it up now," says Biles.
Like her and many others, she has an expectation or maybe rather an awareness that the situation may arise that the games will not be held in 2021.
Predicting that is still hopeless.
No one can know how the situation with the coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but to prepare for the Olympics assuming they will be held next year.
Maybe the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
The wedding was postponed due to illness
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to get married to former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are more important things to think about right now," said the actor in an interview with People.
We definitely want to get married sometime and have that dream wedding with all the people close to us in attendance.
We decided to postpone it and focus on what is important right now and that is to help share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying home.
I'm paying more attention to world affairs than wedding affairs these days.
"There is a lot going on and we need to pay attention to what is happening in the world."
