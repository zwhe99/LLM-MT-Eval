Reasons why I defected from PDP.
The former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has explained some reasons why he left the PDP to join the APC.
If not mistaken, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has decamped from the PDP and joined the APC in this moment.
Dogara said that he left the PDP in Bauchi state and supported the opposition party APC after successfully helping the candidate win the 2019 election.
"The main reason why PDP won in Bauchi State is the massive support they received."
Everyone knows the kind of rift that occurred in the state governorship election where former Minister from Abuja Bala Mohammed defeated incumbent governor Mohammed Abubakar.
But now I am a commissioner with a portfolio in Bala's government.
I decided to join PDP because I am convinced that there is no alternative and I know where I am coming from.
Dogara writes resignation letter from the PDP, which he handed over to the chairman of his local government, Bogoro C, in Bauchi state.
He said it was like how other governments announce when they are about to undertake projects and when they will be completed, and Bala is not a dishonest person.
Make sure to lock them up securely.

Mojisola said using a mosquito net is important because one should not wait to contract malaria before taking preventive measures.
After the spread of the Coronavirus pandemic, those engaged in business activities conducted research to understand it so as not to be caught off guard by the disease.
"Many of them were protesting their grievances to the government to demand justice and fair treatment."
"So NAFDAC has warned some traders and vendors who sell medicines and drugs without authorization to stop the act."

APC appoints governor to bring development projects to the party members in Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
A congratulatory message from the APC party on the inauguration of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello in Neja state, urging him to bring development to the party.
The report states that the President of the Engineering Society, Muhammad Jibrin Imam, and the Secretary General of the Bar Association, Muhammed Liman, have collected a total of 512 million Naira during the six years that their organization has been in power in the state.
The report emphasized that during the governor's call to the water and sanitation sector, which he made on Sunday at the main gathering place in the state, it will help to bring about the provision of basic needs to the community. They wrote out the necessary steps the community organization should take to ensure the availability of water and proper sanitation in the state.
The Engineer Imam said, "We understand that the Governor of Neja is planning to renovate the wells of the members of the community through the provision of water and irrigation facilities without any regulation, because any contribution made to the leadership of the society should be recorded and accounted for to ensure transparency."
He mentioned that currently, the total amount of the organization's assets is five hundred and twelve million Naira in the company's records.
He said that what he understood as becoming the governor-elect during the gubernatorial elections in the state, which was held on July 25, 2020, the country's president has congratulated him to acknowledge his victory and to ensure the resolution of issues among the members of various political parties causing tensions among the citizens.
He said that the funds we received were meant for the welfare of the members of the trade union and some of the purposes of the union that they serve. The gold bars and other precious metals were collected to solve some of the problems of the members of the union such as the provision of healthcare facilities due to the difficulty in obtaining government aid. We did not kill any member of the union for any reason, we will provide evidence if required regarding the funds of the union.
As I explained earlier, the gold deposits in the northern part of the state were discovered and this became the most important source of wealth in this country. We have been using modern technology and mining equipment to extract the gold, and the government collects taxes and royalties from this activity in the twenty-five local government areas of the state. This revenue is used to fund various development projects and to provide social services for the people. However, there have been some incidents of illegal mining, and the government is cracking down on those who engage in this activity.
That's why it's important for every person to speak out against violence towards society without any reservation, as this is the only way to prevent further occurrences and avoid repeating the same mistakes. Therefore, one does not need a mandate to investigate how the society was able to bring about the killing of its members, but must take personal responsibility to do so.
From among the many issues that the government spokesperson spoke about, one particular issue that caught the attention of the public was the issue of security. Security is a concern that the country's society must pay attention to, and not just this issue alone, but also any other issue that poses a threat to the peace and stability of the society.
The Imam said that we should be loyal to the APC party whether as members or supporters from the beginning or those who recently joined, and he added that any form of discrimination against a member of the party or a party leader from any part of the state is against the principles of the party as stated in section 21 (B) (d) of the party's constitution.
Because of this, those who have water and food in the community do not have any sense of urgency, especially if they have the means to pay for the high cost, and so their actions do not have any impact.
Due to this evidence, the trusted leaders of the organization in the state, representing the 21 local government areas, are all committed to the mission of the organization, and anything that goes against it will not be of any benefit.
"Because the law prohibits the sale and consumption of alcoholic drinks, their production is prohibited as well."
He said, those who attended the meeting with goodwill today at midnight, which included Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, Janar Muhammed Garba, Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, as well as Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all the commissioners, were not in any way opposed to the progress of the society in the state.
The water scarcity crisis affecting the community, Engineer Mohammed Imam, as the head of the association, will take responsibility for addressing it rather than the governor or the leaders of the regional association.
The news reports that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello declared that the main focus of his administration is to provide basic necessities for the people of the state, including the provision of healthcare and education, as well as tackling political positions, which is a challenge for both the government and the people.
The report emphasized the need for members of the Tarayya state legislature who have the responsibility of carrying out discussions and making decisions to prioritize finding solutions to all the problems that are affecting the public. This is not only a responsibility but also a duty for members who are trusted to be representatives of the people and work towards the betterment of the community.
Because of this, there is a need for the leader of the opposition party in the country to intervene and urge Governor Abubakar Sani Bello to take steps to improve the governance of the state.
Nigeria's economy is grappling with it on the internet platform - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
"The Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Pantami, said that this country is venturing into a new economy with the rise of the internet economy."
It also means that the government is working hard to ensure that every community, including those with limited access to water, contribute to the development and growth of this country in every way possible.
Dr Isa Ali Fantami has explained this as a result of a high level of awareness campaign on the dangers of fake news spread through the internet.
Thus, the minister announced that one of the objectives of the first city and government partnership was to ensure that the country is recognized for its digital economy, which involves transforming workers from informal to formal sectors through internet-based entrepreneurship programs.
How food insecurity affects the welfare of people in Nigeria.
Some chemists have warned people who use water filtration systems to be careful as excessive consumption of purified water could lead to health problems related to the lack of essential minerals in the human body.
The people made this protest after discovering the irregularities involved in the procurement of food in this country.
The warning label shows that there are some foods that contain allergens to prevent them from being sold.
The billboard also indicates that this investment is being utilized in the development of the village, including the construction of schools and provision of healthcare services to the people.
The use of a compass is necessary because if a person knows how to use it, they can benefit from it.
Then eating food that includes this recipe can prevent high blood pressure, heart disease, and other related illnesses.
They named the people in this country to be mindful of using these types of foods to maintain their health.
If not for the vigilance of Grace Olasumbo, a food processing company, some Nigerians would have consumed foodstuffs mixed with Calcium Carbide powder.
Olasumbo explained that Sindarin Calcium Carbide is the most commonly used product by traders for illuminating their stalls, particularly those selling marble items.
The research shows that inflation and recession are among the factors that prevent traders from utilizing this opportunity as in one year, the cost of goods will increase.
Olasumbo explained that the reason why traders are interested in this product is that it is used as an indicator to determine the purity of gold except for its color.
According to the evidence, you should avoid foods that are high in sugar, salt, fats, carbohydrates, flour, and other similar ingredients.

Recently, the United States of America has raised concerns over the re-election of Adesina as the president of the African Development Bank, after allegations of impropriety were dismissed, causing anxiety among member nations of the bank.

Title: "When the Mayor Visited the Wadata Community with Food" - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the nourishment of every creature's life, one cannot live without food.
This is the evidence that the government of China is making efforts to show the people of the country the quality of food.
In 1971, shortly after the establishment of the Republic of People's China, the country received numerous aids in the form of food to help combat hunger and malnutrition in the population. The aid demonstrated the strength of the country's ability to provide for its citizens and it was reported that the amount of aid received was worth 1.4 billion yuan.
This effort is helping to reduce the poverty that exists in the country of China by providing significant infrastructure and agriculture developments in the world. Just like how the head of the Adana Hatsi agency and the leader of the Sin Zhang Wufeng grain production team have stated that, since 1949, Sin has been leading the way in introducing better food production practices throughout the country.
But on the other hand, some people and certain media outlets are asking "what is the point" of countries like China demonstrating their ability to control and combat the spread of COVID-19 in all parts of the world?
We are grateful for the new opportunity and we will work towards achieving success in the world.
On the occasion of the Communist Party's visit to China, the country's victory in improving food production was attributed to the collective efforts of the people.
The success of Sinawa's food business comes from within the numerous members of JKS governmental organization.
"At the opening of the new manufacturing plant, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Knowledge Sharing (JKS), the President of China, Xi Jinping, emphasized the importance of investing in agriculture, stating that everyone knows that food security is essential for any country's success."
Despite the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic this year, it has brought about a significant improvement in China's economy, as the country is able to provide food security for its citizens.
The Director of the National Agricultural Research Institute in the country of Sin has announced the release of agricultural statistics, particularly regarding rice production in the country in the year 2020. The rice production in the country in 2020 totaled 27.29 million tons, an increase of 1.08 million tons or 3.9% from the 2019 production figures.
He is Ke Bingsheng, the former director of the Agriculture Research Institute in China, he said that China has obtained multiple benefits from the development of the food industry if we consider the rapid growth of consumption and the emergence of homemade food and open doors to others in terms of trade.
Huang Jikun, the head of the Agricultural Economics department at Peking University in China, stated in an interview with "The China Science Daily" that the overall food security situation in China is currently stable, with sufficient supplies of rice and wheat for at least the next 2 years, and that the country is able to control the prices of rice and wheat in the domestic market.
Now, every individual can get 474 kilograms of crops, which equals 400 kilograms in reality, in every year.
And now, the country of China is embarking on some agricultural projects worth millions of tons to improve food security.
"Furthermore, those who have swollen glands should apply warm compresses to the affected area and rest or those with swollen glands due to an infection should stay at home."
"They who are skilled can make a living from what they create or produce."

Just watch and see, there will be a lot of politicking and maneuvering in 2023.
Dan Uwa and a major supporter of the President of the country, Muhammadu Buhari, Mamman Daura has revealed that the structure of governance in Nigeria needs to be overhauled and restructured at the moment.
Mamman Daura said that Nigeria needs a strong leadership that can tackle the challenges facing it in order to elect a capable leader in 2023.
Hausa: BBC Hausa aired a program in which Mamman Daura, who is inside, spoke about it. English: BBC Hausa broadcasted a program in which Mamman Daura, who is inside, spoke about it.
This current period is critical for the election of the president in Nigeria, as there has not been a visually impaired individual who has been elected since 1999.
Daura always emphasizes the need for honesty in all dealings and does not promote any form of fraudulent behavior.
And also the Igbo tribe, known as Inyamirai, have praised Daura for these words of wisdom.
They said both himself and his son, President Buhari, will cause chaos in the country in order to retain power and now he has come out to say he doesn't want anyone to rule like that in 2023.
"He alone, Buhari, cannot successfully govern all Nigerians."
That is the majority of the youth in this country who have been sitting idle for years without being employed, therefore they have no other means of livelihood.
Instruction: Please provide context or additional information as the Hausa phrase "Martanin Inyamirai" can have multiple meanings depending on the context in which it is used.
A protest against the government of Nigeria took place on Wednesday, following the Igbo Socio-Cultural Group's accusation of Mamman Daura of the Fulani domination of the Nigerian government.
In a meeting held in Daura, which was chaired by the son of President Muhammadu Buhari, it was announced that there will be a massive campaign for his re-election as President in 2023.
That is why the article did not gain much traction on social media, because the Igbo people strongly criticized Mamman Daura's statement, which included a call for political zoning.
On Wednesday, the Igbo community organized a summit at Yankin Kudu and in attendance were some politicians eyeing the presidency in 2023. This marks the first Igbo summit of its kind.
The spokesperson of the Igbo Kabir Group Zalla, Emeka Attamah, said that Mamman Daura's statement about the presidency of Nigeria in 2023 is like a death knell for the Igbo group.
In the coming year 2019, Mamman Daura intends to embark on a massive agricultural project.
"They rejected Jonathan, now Daura has given the position of presidential candidate who will represent Nigeria in the 2023 election."
As soon as he completes the work he is doing as the leader of this country, then he will hand over to someone whom we don't know yet in 2023.
He should become truly humble and handle it properly.
No one can guarantee the continuity of the current presidential regime in this country in 2023, and only time will tell.
The Age of Enlightenment Program of VOA has been beneficial.

Northern Media Writers Summit for Northern Issues.
The social media platforms of our time such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, and others have become very popular for facilitating communication and sharing of news, ideas and opinions amongst people all over the world, including matters relating to faith, culture, and politics, education and business.
People in Nigeria have entered into this new trend of using social media together, to stay connected, share experiences and not miss out on important events happening in their lives.
We can say that these industries bring us a lot of benefits and the people of the North are very involved in the business, economy, education and politics.
Some people grind their food using a pestle and mortar or a grinding stone, and they also mix in ingredients that add flavor or nutrients to the food.
Indeed, it is clear that some individuals take advantage of the opportunity provided by the availability of drugs to engage in the abuse of substances. This has resulted in some young people from poor families in this country indulging in criminal activities to earn a livelihood, both within and outside the country, or engaging in petty theft and drug trafficking.
The indication of violence shows that there is unrest within the people of this country.
Today, Arewa Media Writers Association is a great blessing to the people of the North, as it promotes the culture, values, and various activities that the people engage in on social media, in order to become more united and to better represent the opinions and interests of the people of Arewa.
It has become our duty to join this organization urgently, in order to gather the benefits of goodness, and that they will not only be limited to our Northern region, but also to the whole of Nigeria.
I am concerned about our people, especially those who are using motorcycles for transportation in groups. They should come together and work towards maintaining peace and unity to promote the development of the North and its future generations, and we should establish a system that will serve everyone equally.
Just as our leaders in the North who have been united, such as the Sardaunan of Sokoto, the first Premier of the North, Sir Ahmadu Bello, and his cabinets worked towards the development of the people in the North.
I heard that the Marigayi, who fought against oppression and injustice, Malam Aminu Kano, declared that Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows their own home!
Therefore, we say, just as we have named it in terms of combating terrorism and preserving the security and sovereignty of the country, in all sincerity, we call on the northern people, without any distinction of religion or ethnicity, to unite and join hands with us.
If we compare how the North was before to how it is now, there is a noticeable difference.
Therefore, we must make use of the guidance of Allah to avoid poverty and hardship, in order to achieve progress and development in Northern Nigeria through effective management of its economic resources.
The northern region must prioritize developing its agricultural sector to avoid relying on the government for funds.
As much as we want progress in the North, we should prioritize education, agriculture, healthcare, and science and technology.
Never will we rely solely on money to solve problems, there are various different ways to do that.
We know that it is so, the North will rule in their turn!
"We in the North are the land of hospitality."
The government allocated 126 billion naira to improve healthcare in this country.
The government of the country has allocated 126 billion naira from various sources to boost the agricultural sector in the country.
The use of synthetic oxytocin can be replaced with the use of FMC, a facility for conducting multiple deliveries, a room for delivering and attending to mothers during labor, a room that accommodates multiple delivery beds and provides privacy for mothers who do not want to be around other people. This facility is available in 36 states in the country.
In recent years, there have been some innovations in the field of healthcare that have caught the attention of the government in order to join hands in improving the healthcare sector of this country.
The government has made this call to establish medical centers to improve public health and well-being during these trying times, particularly in Abuja.
In response, a small-scale businessman and the representative of Kwara North Senatorial District in the All Progressives Congress (APC), Sadiq Umar, said that the Nigerian government must take measures to address the issue of the country's worsening security situation, which is of great importance.
"He said that the reason for doing so is because art is known for causing relaxation in times of stress, and it also helps to gather different cultures and experiences from different parts of the world."
Umar says that all these books that have been gathered have no evidence of the government's commitment to improving the health sector, hence they have started rejecting these books that they have been receiving.

They held it at Mariyamu and Yakubu Ebent Centre in Wakili neighbourhood.
That is how the conversation between ABM Stephen Shekari (rty) and Dr. Salim Umar, who represents Atyap community, went, regarding ensuring peace amongst the various religious and ethnic groups living together.
"All the leaders of the Atyap people, including the Fulani and Hausa, joined hands in the aftermath of the crisis that followed the installation of the Agwatyap."
In the aftermath of a conflict that lasted for 14 days and resulted in many casualties, Atyap men from the eastern region raised a grievance and accused someone of wielding a weapon in his possession, which led to the involvement of security forces.
The government has shown evidence of its commitment to every Nigerian becoming a productive member in any sector of the country that has a potential for growth, including areas with security challenges such as Atyap, without prejudice or discrimination against anyone.

How Ganduje removed the Emir of Kano and Sanusi and appointed new ones, he will also appoint new government officials in Kano.
Governor Abdullahi Ganduje wants the State House of Assembly in Kano State to dissolve before the end of 2019, to demonstrate the support of some prominent political leaders in Kano such as the former Emir of Kano, Ado Bayero, and the current Emir, Sanusi, that the dissolution of the state house of assembly will lead to the appointment of new emirs for Kano State.
The speaker of the Kano State House of Assembly, Abdullahi Gafasa, read out Ganduje's request at the start of the session and suggested they have a discussion before the end of July.
The leaders who arrived for the Kano Investment Summit are Aminu Babba Dangundi, who is the Sarkin Dawaki Mai Tuta and the Prince of Kano, Sanusi Ado-Bayero.
"Six traditional rulers were deposed by King Ado and King Muhammadu Sanusi due to their involvement in partisan politics."
Babba Dan'agundi was hit with a stick in the street.
At the age of 17, she embraced Sharia law as soon as she arrived in Koli village.
This is also what Ganduje wants to achieve with his government, to maintain stability and become one of the leaders in the governance of Kano state.
Ado Bayero removed Ɗan'agundi in 2003 after accusing him of engaging in unethical political activities and causing chaos in the state.
He volunteered to investigate the matter, but he was told to stay behind because he is too young for the task.
From there, he was transferred from Babbar Kotun in Kano State to Koli Town.
Before the Ƙoli city and Daukaka city merged, the Tarayya village was under the rule of Aminu Babba in his jurisdiction.
However, the Kano State Government under the leadership of Muhammadu Sanusi II, intervened and reversed the decision when the Court of Appeal ruled in favor of the removal of the Hakimin Gabasawa and Sarkin Dawaki Mai Tuta on June 5.
After the removal of Sanusi Bayero as the Crown Prince of Kano due to his disagreement with the government of the Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, in June 2014.

NAPTIP has arrested human traffickers and rescued 71 people in Kano state.
The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), in collaboration with the Kano state government and the Department of Security Services, intercepted 71 human trafficking victims at a major transportation hub in the state.
The commissioner of Kano state, Shehu Umar, announced on Friday during his visit to the headquarters of Nigeria News Agency.
He said that the government provided assistance to travelers who were stranded after they encountered travel difficulties in the state.
The reason for this is that the government provided assistance to these people from July 15th to 19th, when they were affected by floods.
"From among the people we have compared, Kamaru, who is one of Nigeria's two, the others were all within the age range of 21 to 36."
"These people were stopped from travelling to Algeria, Morocco and Libya."
After that, 18 people out of 71 who were traveling from the country of Cameroon from the inside had 14 men and 4 women.
Nineteen other people who left Nigeria left, 11 men, 8 women, and children from Kano state.
Umar said he will vote for the government of Kamaru when he turns 18, in order to exercise his civic responsibility.
It is also the responsibility of the agency to recruit 34 people and the NIS agency to train in Katsina State.

"Good Governance, Transparency, and Accountability are what is in the Heart - Leadership Hausa Newspapers."
The Longyuan power station in Hongsipu, in the city of Wuzhong in Ningxia province, belongs to the Hui ethnic group and is located in the northern part of the country.
There is a female philanthropist named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (her Muslim name) who is well-known for the charity work she does in life and the help she provides to those in need, especially for the poor who are struggling to survive.
The news revealed to us that courage, determination, and faith are all within the heart.
At first, whether it was Li Yaomei or Sadiya, they couldn't imagine studying without having the necessary school materials, as it was impossible to write without a pen and paper.
Only Allah gives a woman the ability of sight, intelligence, and wisdom beyond measure, such that she becomes exemplary in the field of work and excellence.
At the age of 20, Madam Li Yaomei gained fame for her exceptional skill in Chinese embroidery, where she taught a young girl in her neighborhood at the age of 13.
After cleaning and dressing up, she faced the challenges ahead and now she is on her way with the bag that was packed in the corner.
These recent floods have caused havoc to the state's health situation, as well as the economy, evidenced by the loss of over 3 million naira worth of crops and properties.
The main point is that, in this situation, Malama Sadiya's contribution has become a means of guidance and help in overcoming the challenges of life.
Then the military of the Chinese government called the Red Army declared war on the women of Gwiwa.
"Sana'arta" means "learning" or "education". "ita ce" is a phrase used to introduce the subject of a sentence, and it means "it is". "Yin tsintsiya" means "to acquire knowledge" or "to seek understanding". "Nau'ika daban-daban" means "various skills". "Bisa amfani da ciyayi" means "for practical use".  Putting it all together, the sentence means:  "Learning is about acquiring knowledge of various skills for practical use."
Due to the man's stubbornness, the business failed greatly, where various partners did not tolerate his deceitfulness.
Moreover, she meticulously arranged the tools that helped the women in carrying out their work.
For example, she used to take 15 minutes to complete a big task before, but now at this time, she will complete similar tasks in 5 minutes intervals.
Then, she came up with some great ideas that revolutionized the way things were being done.
Then there is a large machine that washes clothes automatically, and now people can travel with these machines for convenience.
The meaning of the visit by Malama Sadiya and the effort she has made so far to ensure the improvement of livelihoods with her colleagues is evidence that there is indeed hope for progress.
Hard work, honesty, and integrity are the only ways to succeed in life; there is nothing that can be achieved through deceit in the government.
If the government decides to implement reforms, but people do not have education or awareness of their rights to participate in them, then the reforms will only be a mere show without achieving any real change.
The news shows that engaging in a business or seeking for profit does not always require some deceitful or fraudulent activities or traveling to some dangerous or risky places or regions.
Because she is surrounded by loved ones, she makes use of the blessings available to her in order to improve her quality of life.
In essence, Madam Sadiya was confronted with these challenges due to her persistence and determination, without giving heed to any adversity, be it poverty, illiteracy or marital issues, because she persevered and overcame them.
That is, with hard work, perseverance, and determination, anything is possible within the heart.
Then he showed the type of power that women have in shaping their own lives and communities without needing the help of anyone.
This lesson shows that whatever a person does, he must be careful enough to avoid harm, because there will always be consequences for every action.
Truthfully, Malama Sadiya has become an inspiration, with her intelligence, wisdom and exemplary behavior that serves as a guide for others.
Today, at the beginning of the month of March, Malama Sadiya finished presenting all the requirements needed, and then submitted a request for approval from the government with great anticipation.

"There is a difference of opinion in the United States government on how to combat COVID-19" - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
The current Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has emphasized the importance of everyone coming together in the fight against COVID-19. He highlighted the need to provide accurate information to various communities in different countries, in order to combat misinformation and fear surrounding the pandemic.
And one should preserve the beauty that is found in the world, because it will bring about great benefits for different countries.
Indeed, some politicians in America have made a pledge to provide evidence of their concern for their people, including the fight against the spread of disease, as well as to reinforce the bond of unity between states and nations in times of war and conflict.
Currently, the number of people confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 globally has reached 23 million.
In the number, there are people who have abandoned their prayers in exchange for a sum of money up to 800 dollars.
This powerful medicine has a significant impact on the treatment of joint pain. It is also highly effective, and in the future, it could become a major breakthrough in the treatment of various diseases. The results are impressive, and there is growing interest from researchers in countries across the globe. There is great hope that it could become an essential tool in helping people overcome illness and disease worldwide.
But the real problem is that some American politicians are showing their hatred for Islam.
Recently, the "Science" magazine reported that the US government has appropriated around six billion dollars from various funding sources to accelerate the development of effective treatments and vaccines for COVID-19.
In English: Indeed, we understand that the United States government's priority is to combat disease outbreaks, but other countries with weaker health systems need financial assistance to improve their health infrastructure, considering that they struggle with lack of basic healthcare needs. It is important to note that investing in healthcare has enormous benefits for the well-being of the population.
"The Ecologist" magazine recently reported that if the United States stops the use of fossil fuels, the number of countries dependent on oil will decline significantly.
The tree of Africa's disease control center, Mr. John Nkengasong, has shown great leadership in this matter.
Just as some who explain the importance of education every day or provide assistance to the disabled, it will not be enough to heal the wound after the sickness without knowing how to prevent it, so it is essential to consider how to strengthen education, which is essential for everyone.
And the countries of the world continue to build a strong bond that brings them together.
The WHO director-general, Tedros, has indicated that if we are to prevent the spread of disease, we must prioritize it above all else in the world. This means that we must work to stem the impact of the pandemic before worrying about the economic or political implications it may have for various countries.

There is a market for second-hand clothes and shoes in the northern region, and every government is interested in only their own profit, but the traders have no choice but to keep buying and selling, and then they will find a way to make a living and stay healthy.
But this belief will not benefit this country if the leaders do not have vision, because all the people in this country are equal, peace is the way to achieve it.
