In my opinion, the literature program was formed by Balzac's age ladies based on their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century, we prefer Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
"They wrote fiction, of course, from the perspective of those same Balzacian ladies."
But psychology and the torments of heroines in Tolstoy's and Turgenev's works are not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are generally rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige Mattress 105x195.
Model "Micropacket Prestige": Comfort and Natural Composition.
The mattress has different levels of stiffness on its sides: the medium-firm surface is made of latex-coated coconut fiber and natural latex, while the moderately soft side is made of a slab of natural latex.
A spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the sleeping body, preventing the appearance of the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model, it is necessary to highlight breathable materials.
Perforated latex provides excellent breathability and is naturally ventilated, much like coconut coir.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate of the sleeping area is maintained.
Also, an extended warranty period applies to the mattress.
The official manufacturer's warranty period is 5 years, but in reality the mattress can be used for a longer period.
Protection against dust and dirt is provided by a removable jacquard cover supplied in the set.
Get an orthopedic pillow to go with your mattress - it is recommended for maintaining the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

The computer science teacher won't be able to help either, they weren't taught that. The students are playing games on Windows.
So there is no support.
I remember those family gatherings and guests at my parents' house with horror.
The guests are at the doorstep, and the meatballs are still cooking on the stove, the mother hastily washes the floor.
Oh Lord, I was already exhausted sitting down at the table.
And then wash the dishes again and clean the house.
You drag the groceries a week before the holiday, cook for two days, and clean up the day after.
And what about the guests?
"They are doing well, and they must have a cake with them too."
Since then, I don't like holidays and guests.
Even for my own family, I set the table with the minimum amount.
And I cook them delicious treats, I bake quite often just for fun.
Germany: Fourth vaccination against coronavirus is inevitable.
The fourth vaccination will be required in summer or autumn 2022.
According to an expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final one and will continue with renewed force.
Despite the active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will likely be sufficient for complete protection.
This is what the leader of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced of.
On Saturday, December 11, Die Welt reported about it.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be needed in the summer, at the latest in the fall," believes the expert.
Furthermore, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with the flu vaccination".
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new Omicron strain of coronavirus.
Moreover, the new variant is particularly dangerous.
So, the likelihood of reinfection with "Omicron" is three times higher than with Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omicron by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of coronavirus "Omicron".
The study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that with two vaccine doses, the effectiveness is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential decreases by more than 25 times."
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain," underlined BioNTech and Pfizer.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases Bernd Sälzbacher advocates for shortening the interval between the second and third vaccination.
Moreover, as Zaltsberger believes, an accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the Omicron variant of coronavirus.
"The experience of Israel very convincingly demonstrates this," emphasized the expert.
Pontoon21 lure, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
Bet-A-Vib series - a special branch of the Bet-A family from the company Pontoon21®.
She, like the Kalikana Vib series, differs from many other lures in that it was originally designed with the intention of being used for ice fishing, and not just for casting.
These lures have a higher specific weight than similar ones with similar dimensions, which undoubtedly has a positive impact on the nuances of using these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is the top fin made of durable and flexible plastic, creating additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal retrieval.
During winter fishing with Bet-A-Vib bait, it demonstrates a quite aggressive game.
Often the most catchy animation is a simple monotonous animation, which means the movement of the tail up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space cluttered with underwater vegetation, roots, and other obstacles that can cause entanglement.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant in winter fishing for pike-perch and large perch, especially in the middle of winter when a precise and aggressive bait presentation is required.
Reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the initial vertical position.
Bet-A-Vib is equally successful for winter fishing for pond trout.
To cater to her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib, as a game of vertical drop, is able to irritate a passive pike that does not even respond to live bait.
When casting with Bet-A-Vib, it demonstrates range and accuracy.
This lure is easy to understand and not picky, it works well with both fishing line and braided lines even of larger diameters.
"For catching pike, perch, roach, or perch using a uniform technique is effective as well as a "step" technique, sometimes with a "scratching" motion along the bottom."
If you are fishing in overgrown areas, you can replace the front treble hook with a double hook, which will reduce the likelihood of snags.
Among the lures of its class, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most durable and consequently one of the most efficient in catching fish.
It can be used with equal success on relatively small and fairly deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, they announced 7,000 Russian mercenaries.
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the private military company (PMC) "Wagner" in Libya.
This was announced on Sunday, December 12, by the chairman of the Higher State Council of the Republic, Khaled al-Mishri.
"At present, there are over 7,000 mercenaries of the Private Military Company "Wagner" in Libya."
They have airplanes too.
"They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra."
"They have 30 jet planes at the Gardabya air bases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," Anadolu agency quotes him.
Khaled al-Mishri also stated that Russian mercenaries are "trying to seize" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after they "put their man in power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain presence
According to an interviewee of the publication, Moscow was searching for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya."
"Wagner" has been present in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufra, as noted in the agency's publication.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner PMC receives support from the Kremlin.
Where else could mercenaries be?
According to the agency, "Wagner" is believed to operate in nine African countries - the Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal security for leaders, and protection for energy facilities.
"In exchange for these services, the subsidiary companies of Wagner are granted certain privileges and licenses for the use of minerals and natural resources as well as for the supply of weapons, technologies, and military services to these countries," the article states.
As claimed by the media, the "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan, and the Central African Republic.
This group is not registered in the government forces or in the list of legal entities, and its fighters are not present in the formal personnel lists.
This company is under US sanctions.
Reminder, earlier the permanent representatives of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against "Wagner".
It is expected that the decision of the European Union Council will be approved on December 13.
Situation in Libya
The Higher State Council of Libya de facto functions as the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions, dominated by Islamists, TASS reports.
This body has repeatedly called for a postponement of the unified election day for parliamentary deputies and the head of state from December 24th to at least February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks left until the elections, and the chances of them taking place on time are rapidly decreasing," notes the article.
Against this background, the High Electoral Commission of Libya has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates indefinitely, Sky News Arabia reports.
Russian foreign policy through the eyes of Russians.
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, while 29% believe failures prevail.
"Examples of successes - "we protected and restored peace in Syria", "decision on "Nord Stream 2"," "we scared the whole world with our powerful weapons", "we annexed Crimea"."
The main failures - "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world" - are stated in the study by the "Public Opinion" Foundation.
The Dubai government completely abandoned paper document management - all public services have also become digital only.
The Dubai government announced a complete abandonment of paper documentation and transition to digital technologies.
All government services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marked the beginning of a new stage in the digitalization of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," said Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Crown Prince of the Emirates and Chairman of Dubai's Executive Council, on Saturday.
Now the internal and external document flow in all government agencies in Dubai will only be conducted in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all industries without exception: healthcare, housing and communal services, police, municipal bodies, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitization of document flow began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, according to the authorities' calculations, 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which equals to 14 million hours of human labor and $353.8 million in monetary value.
Earlier, the Mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, stated that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

Production and export of cars in Turkey fell below the level of 2020.
The production and export of cars in Turkey sharply decreased in November against the backdrop of the devaluation of the lira.
As a result, the industry indicators for the first 11 months turned out to be worse than last year's result, reports Bloomberg, citing data from the Association of Automobile Manufacturers in Turkey.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were produced from the factories in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than the previous year.
About 75.9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% lower than last year's figure.
And if the automotive sector of Turkey demonstrated positive dynamics compared to last year's results in the first 10 months of this year, then by the end of November 2021, car production was already 0.3% worse than last year's figure.
The reason for such a fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira exchange rate, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 small and medium-sized businesses have received a deferral on loan payments in 2021.
The First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov spoke about the situation regarding the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, reported by the correspondent of Kazinform news agency.
According to the Republic of Kazakhstan Agency for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, in the current year, in implementation of the Head of State's assignment from April 1, 2021, Order No. 127 "On Approval of the Procedure for Providing Loan Payment Deferrals to Small and Medium-Sized Business Entities" was adopted by the Chairman of the Agency on April 9, 2021, wrote Alihan Smailov in his response to a parliamentary inquiry.
He reminded that the procedure for granting loan payment deferral provided for banks and microfinance organizations to grant payment deferrals on loans issued to SME entities, including individual entrepreneurs, before April 1, 2021, during the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferment period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the discretion of the SME subject.
The borrower's application could have indicated a different term for payment deferral.
"During the deferment period for the borrower, the claim and lawsuit work, notification of the need to repay overdue debt, as well as the collection of commissions and other payments by the creditor were suspended," the Deputy Prime Minister noted.
In 2021, second-tier banks received requests for loan payment deferment from 603 MSB borrowers, out of which 553 MSB borrowers were granted deferment on a total of 9.7 billion tenge.
"131 MSB subjects have applied for a deferment in the MFO, of which deferment has been granted to 95 subjects in the amount of 105.8 million tenge," concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immune systems are able to easily tolerate the "Omicron" strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may tolerate it more easily than those with a strong immune response in their body.
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the "Omicron" strain of coronavirus could be dangerous.
The reason should be sought in the conditions of the virus's origin.
Scientists believe that "okmiran" originated in the body of a person infected with HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
That is, during mutation, it did not encounter any resistance from the immune system.
Thanks to this, he is more aggressive.
Due to the lack of response from the immune system, it became very fast.
"Apparently, he has more spike proteins and spikes than it should be, and his antibodies were not reduced during mutations," comments pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev."
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may tolerate "Okmiron" easier than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that a strong response of the body to anything, including any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself on its own.
And that happens with pneumococcal infections, when young people aged 30 die, while elderly people aged 60 can just sneeze and get over it.
"The immune response is crazy in the young, it is completely inadequate: where it was only possible to wag a finger, it hits like a cannon firing at sparrows," concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial or viral.
If the first one can be treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, often only the symptoms can be alleviated - all hope is on the organism.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication of the body - this is temperature, weakness, and malaise.
Then come respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, as well as abdominal pain, may also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, the vaccination of the younger generation aged 12 to 18 may begin by the end of the year.
Virologist and head of the genome engineering laboratory at MIPT, Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is suffering very actively from COVID-19.
Teenagers who go to school have the maximum number of contacts.
"This is the most socially active group, just like children in preschools," said Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the Genome Engineering Laboratory at MIPT, to "Moscow 24."

Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of COVID-19.
The authors of the study examined adipose tissue remaining from bariatric surgeries and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected and showed a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists have also examined the adipose tissue of patients who died from COVID and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and flu viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to evade the immune system's response.
Likely, SARS-CoV-2 is capable of this as well.
Biologist talked about the causes of dementia.
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semen Golosheykin named the causes of dementia and talked about ways to prevent it in an interview with Radio Sputnik.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself as a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty even orienting themselves in a familiar environment.
Golosheykin noted that neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins are the most common causes of dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of developing a disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol levels, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
"On a behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity can play a role," he said.
Dementia development is also influenced by harmful habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders, and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate, and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"A discussion is ongoing that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development," added the biologist.
To prevent the onset of disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity and training cognitive skills and abilities that require memory and logic engagement.

Egypt has returned around 30,000 illegally exported artifacts from the country.
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has been able to bring back to their homeland about 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11th, on the Al-Hayat TV channel by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, Shaaban Abdel Gawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian government has managed to retrieve 29,300 artifacts.
"Only this year, 5300 artifacts of the ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered in the Museum of the Bible in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gauad clarified that all artifacts smuggled out have been registered in the archives.
Currently, department employees are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists "track auctions around the world and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that cultural values are restored upon their return, and then exhibited in museums.
According to his words, one of the returned artifacts became the ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium which is now part of the exhibition in the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities turned to Interpol with a request to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun, which was sold at an auction in London.
Christie's auction house held an auction on July 4, at which a bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the piece of art was illegally exported from the Karnak Temple in Luxor during the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the god of the sun Amun, has been kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
It is unknown how the relic ended up in Europe.
Egypt has been actively working towards the repatriation of illegally exported ancient monuments from the country in recent years.
According to the authorities, 95% of smuggled antiques are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, as the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to Turks).
If you want to add it up, only 42 thousand people - that's how many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (according to the census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
The only thing that unites them is the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices.
Credit Suisse demands its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, Financial Times reports.
The thing is, Swiss banks in Europe and the USA do not provide their employees with corporate communication devices. Instead, they offer a discount for purchasing a mobile phone or smartphone from a telecommunications partner.
According to the current rules, a bank may view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to address business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank exercises the right to inspect mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote working mode, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to address work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse is not commenting on the information about the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life, which was 1925, was productive in terms of creativity, but also the heaviest for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego".
He is already outside of any literary associations, he has separated from imagism, he is on his own, but he is well-known, in demand, sometimes strongly criticized by critics, even angrily, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their hands.
Over the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of which are true masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" is completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" is written, 8 books are published, the collection "Soviet Russia" is compiled.
And the main success - at the end of June of the 25th year, Gosizdat signed a contract with Esenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
No modern poet has been honored with such a distinction as Sergei Alexandrovich, he is the first!
Moreover, it promised very good money - according to the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (the factory director, for example, received 300 rubles per month, and the engineer - 200).
Funds were needed like never before that year.
Yesenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter, Sophia Tolstoy. He had to establish a family household and support his sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seems like life was getting better, there was something to be happy about, but for him everything is colored mostly in dark tones, as if the nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death) materialized.
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Either the wind is whistling.
Over an empty and deserted field,
Like a grove in September,
Alcohol scrambles the brain.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin has weakened significantly, looks bad, and is clearly sick.
There are more and more reckless behavior and nervous breakdowns happening.
And the reason, probably, is not only in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was given to Sergey Alexandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents left.
Let's talk about May 1923, when at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan, Esenin was improving his health in a clinic outside Paris under the supervision of Professor Peter Gannushkin (Esenin would return to him two years later, already in Moscow).
And here are the poet's records of binges, scandals on this basis, and plenty of trips to the police - scattered throughout dozens of memoirs.
From the beginning of the 1920s, the terrible romance of a poet with a green snake developed rapidly.
At the end of summer 1923, Esenin briefly settled with his friend, the Imaginist Ivan Startsev.
Amazingly, despite his very decent income, Esenin never had his own home neither in Moscow nor in St. Petersburg, and he lived in rented apartments, hotels, or with acquaintances.
Staryts remembers:
"He only came to spend the night, and in most cases in an insane, drunken state."
Once, returning at four in the morning, Yesenin fell on the landing...
Falling, he scratched his face and gasped.
Coming to his senses, he began to cough continuously, splattering the entire sheet with blood..."
And even Esenin himself, after his trip to Europe and the United States (where there was Prohibition at the time, but Duncan brought a decent supply of alcohol with her), admitted:
"I didn't see anything there except for taverns and streets..."
I'm already towards the end and have stopped remembering people...
Well, and he drank, of course...
"And I drank because I was eaten up with sorrow."

Mattress Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom 100x195.
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom - a modern implementation of a budget model in the premium-class lineup.
The basis of the mattress is the Duet independent double spring unit.
Inside a large spring, a smaller and softer spring is inserted.
This allows for an even distribution of weight on the mattress.
The mattress is filled on both sides with an artificial latex filler.
This is an analogue of natural latex, but it is more dense and less expensive.
The flexibility and resilience of this material increase the comfortable effect of the mattress.
Hypoallergenic artificial latex, it does not absorb moisture and dust.
The mattress would be perfect for a couple with a significant weight difference (of at least 30 kilograms).
Thanks to the "smart" springs, there is no wave effect here, when a lightweight partner rolls to the side of a heavy one.
Pleasant and soft to the touch, the practical jacquard Sense cover is sewn with a layer of padding.
Natural fabric does not accumulate static electricity.
It is possible to manufacture this mattress model in a compressed version (vacuum roll-up packaging).
Now my son is almost 16, and he hasn't had the desire to act foolishly for a long time.
All his energy is focused on the choice of how he will earn his living.
"He is much more responsible than I was at his age or my husband, who had periodic problems with the law right up to the wedding."
The father takes care of his young daughter.
And loves, as Lermontov wrote, with "strange love".
Why did the girl start crying during the exam even though she had not failed it yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it's not a school?
"Well, she'll have a tail."
So what?
"Retake."
Millions of students know this.
What is the talk about?
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon" against the EU.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon".
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland, Pavel Jablonski, expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The Deputy Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a relevant statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus temporarily "stopped Lukashenko," but he "is actively looking for new ways."
Also the Polish official is confident that now illegal migrants will be used as a weapon "in many parts of the world."
As the website kp.ru reported, the European Union previously introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He contacted 17 individuals and 11 organizations physically.
Europe has announced its readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic "if the situation in the country does not improve."
Minsk responded by introducing a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not according to Senka's hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man a laughing stock.
Velvet jackets dominated at social events in 2021.
Perhaps, the first person to declare about their new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die", he appeared in a velvet raspberry jacket and a traditional "Bond-style" bow tie.
After his example, Prince William twice followed suit, first wearing a green velvet jacket that did not comply with the royal dress code to The Earthshot Prize award ceremony and then choosing a more classic option for the event in support of the Royal Variety charity fund.
A few weeks ago, the trend tried on itself and Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to collect the seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same way.
AliExpress is already noting a growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to the analysts of the service, who provided information to "Gazeta.Ru", they have started buying them 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with lining and a slim fit silhouette, the main colors being dark beige, burgundy, dark blue, and of course, black.
The average price of such models is between 3,000 and 6,000 rubles. Men prefer buying only jackets, and they choose velvet suit sets less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next, and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are presented this season in practically all brands - including Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most coveted model is considered to be the Gucci model, in which brand ambassador Jared Leto appeared at the premiere of the movie "House of Gucci."
When choosing jackets from expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special technology of interweaving threads, a dense fabric with a fuzzy outer texture and smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget versions are made of cotton or nylon, but accordingly, they serve less.
Fashion expert from Lamoda, Ilya Vakhoshkin, warns that when it comes to a velvet jacket, the most important thing is not its style or silhouette, but its appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, that's why such a jacket is ideal if you're going to a party or formal event," explains Vakhoshkin. "It is also suitable for occasions where the invitation specifies a "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie" dress code."
Another important criterion that allows choosing a velvet jacket is the status of its buyer.
"According to the authors of the Telegram channel "Handsome Brummell" about men's fashion, a man in a velvet jacket should, first and foremost, acquire the right advanced circle with wealth. Usually, those who own velvet jackets belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets."
They are simply invited to themed social events where a dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with similarly elegant items such as classic trousers with pleats, solid-colored shirts, silk ties, tasseled loafers, and cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Beau Brummell" are convinced: it would be inappropriate for an ordinary employee to appear in a velvet jacket at a corporate event, but if we're talking about "a manager who is in charge of this event, then yes, such an item would be appropriate for him."
If an employee is of lower rank and their goal is to advance higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to obtain financial bonuses, it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion believe that this will be accurately appreciated by the management with the phrase "not in Senka's cap".
Very ambiguous feelings from the voice.
This is an unnatural tone, it feels so strained.
And does not at all associate with the cute face of a young girl.
To be honest, I do not understand the admiration of others.
But I wholeheartedly wish you good luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well-lobbied, in other words, it's paid for.
Billion-dollar investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has increased.
Traditional energy sector is also not at a loss - both gas, oil and coal were purchased at a lower price than they are currently sold.
There is a high demand for fuel.
Pennies are dripping.
And who is in trouble then?
As usual - an ordinary customer.
Do Native American issues affect the sheriff?
Therefore, western politicians should not be considered idiots who have "missed" the energy crisis.
"They have done their job."
For a decent salary.
"I didn't see any beautiful people in the photos in the article."
Just mediocre within the framework of average passengers.
Perhaps, if such individuals are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole train car, then most likely no one will sit next to them.
But only because of mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauties", but certainly not because of their appearance.
"Kazbek, a slave who is aware of his slave condition and is fighting against it, is a revolutionary."
A slave who is unaware of their slavery and languishes in silent, unconscious, and speechless slave life is simply a slave.
"A slave whose mouth waters as he self-righteously describes the attractions of slave life and enthusiastically praises a kind and good master is a serf, a boor."
The immunologist stated that revaccination after 4-5 months will help protect against the "omicron" strain of the coronavirus.
Revaccination after four to five months may protect against the new strain of coronavirus infection "Omicron."
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolay Kryuchkov, who called vaccination after six months, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, "a very long period."
"Under previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to conduct the procedure after five months, and for people with chronic diseases - after four," said the expert, urging to simultaneously engage in revaccination alongside the vaccination campaign.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has received two vaccinations and a booster, or has recovered from the illness and been vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and then contracted the disease, then they have obtained "hybrid immunity", meaning that they have numerous antibodies and enough neutralizing ones," clarified the expert.
"The Big Seven" warned Russia of "massive consequences" in case of an invasion of Ukraine.
The countries of the "Big Seven" (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France, and Japan) have published a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that "Russia's military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will come at a high cost" for Moscow, but specific measures are not described in the document.
"We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military buildup and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine," the statement reads.
Next, the ministers urge Russia to "ease the escalation, use diplomatic channels, and comply with its international obligations regarding transparency in military activities," which President Biden discussed during his video call with President Putin on December 7.
"We confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full compliance with the Minsk agreements in order to settle the conflict in eastern Ukraine," stated the foreign ministers of the G7 as well.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
"Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in response," they warn.
We confirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
"We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement also says.
Earlier in the day, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss stated that Russia will face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her words, this meeting showed the "united voice of the countries of the G7, which account for 50% of the world's GDP and clearly indicated that an invasion of Ukraine will have enormous consequences for Russia".
The Pfizer vaccine has been considered 32 times less effective against the Omicron strain.
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have come to this conclusion, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was deemed less effective based on a study of antiviral activity among citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 drug.
"We are seeing that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original variant of Sars-CoV-2, but this ability has been significantly reduced against the Omicron variant," Professor Malik Peiris said.
At the same time, scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe illness in case of coronavirus infection.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine forecasted the development of the coronavirus pandemic taking into account the impact of the Omicron strain on it.
The research authors concluded that the Omicron strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking NATO weapon supplies to Kyiv.
The Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the government of former Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, of blocking Kiev's acquisition of lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12th, Reznikov reminded that last month Germany imposed a veto on Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles for shooting down drones.
At the same time, it is noted that later Berlin softened its position regarding rifles, recognizing them as non-mortal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kyiv intends to seek the acquisition of the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the USA, Great Britain, Lithuania, and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz regarding the permission of weapons supplies to Ukraine remains unclear for now.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed his opinion that Kyiv should not expect weapons deliveries from Berlin while Chancellor Schulze is in office.
According to his words, the previous leadership of Germany explained their refusal to provide arms as a risk of military escalation in the conflict in Donbass, despite the "occupation by Russia" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is confident that Germany will maintain the same "illogical" position even with a new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Kiev was expecting assistance from Berlin in equipping its navy.
In Ukraine, they hope that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense," added the president.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he advocated for the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

Years... ago, I did the same renovation.
Combined the hall with the kitchen.
The apartment has three rooms.
It means "She/he/it was."

In the hallway, a bookcase and a large wardrobe were made.
The door to the kitchen was blocked, and a lot of space was freed up.
In almost 10 years of living in this apartment, we have never regretted what we have done.
From mistakes - a cool shower cabin was installed instead of a bathtub.
I regretted this a hundred times!

But the wonderful world of rum is still undiscovered for me, except for "Bacardi" and "Captain Morgan".
What else would you recommend, and where could one start this wonderful acquaintance?
I also got sick.
I will not get vaccinated.

"Mercedes" has filed a protest against the results of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
The German team "Mercedes", whose pilot Lewis Hamilton finished second behind Red Bull driver Max Verstappen at the Abi Dhabi Grand Prix, filed a protest against the final race result, according to the Formula 1 press service.

In the first case, the German team challenges the judges' decision to have the circular racers return to one lap with the leaders.
According to the second [rule] - Verstappen overtook Hamilton before the allowed "restart" zone.
It should be added that now the result of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, according to which Verstappen beat Hamilton by 2.256 seconds and won the "Formula 1" world championship, is preliminary, as it is unknown when Mercedes' protests will be considered.
G7 warns Russia about responsibility for intrusion into Ukraine.
Foreign ministers of G7 countries have warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues its military aggression towards Ukraine, as stated in the final statement of the parties.
The meeting participants also noted that they condemn the strengthening of Russian armed forces along the country's borders.
"There should be no doubt in Russia that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs," the statement published on the website of the UK government said.
The ministers of the G7 countries and the High Representative of the EU noted that they are "united in their condemnation of Russian military buildup and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine."
The Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, Elizabeth Truss, warned of "significant consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine during a press conference in Liverpool.
We have made it clear that any invasion will have significant consequences...
"G7 wants Russia to abandon aggression towards Ukraine," she said (quote from TASS).
Earlier, at the G7 Foreign Ministers' Summit in Liverpool, it was agreed that in order to resolve the crisis caused by the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties need to return to the negotiating table.

Ways to return money stolen through online stores have been revealed.
There are several ways to return money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were exposed by experts on information security in a conversation with RBK.
So, in order to reduce the risk of major losses when bank card data falls into the hands of fraudsters, it is recommended to keep the main funds on a card or bank account that is not used for online shopping.
A portion of savings can be deposited into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend getting a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen during purchases at stores that do not use 3D Secure protective technology, you can initiate a refund process.
"As part of the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions conducted without using 3D Secure, responsibility is placed on the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service," clarified a representative of Promsvyazbank.
Arthur Zaremba, an expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, emphasized that the buyer has the right to file a claim to the bank disputing a fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used a card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be protested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return funds to the customer if the order has not yet been shipped for delivery.
On November 19, the member of the Public Chamber and director of the Safe Internet League, Ekaterina Mizulina, reported that in 2021 alone, they received 11,000 reports of various cases of fraud, ranging from the sale of fake documents to personal data theft.
According to her words, an effective solution under current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints about online scammers.
Schulz arrived in Poland to discuss "Nord Stream 2" and EU legislation.
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for negotiations related to the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian troops near the border with Ukraine, and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream 2".
Although Scholtz stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed clear expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that he will call on Schulz to oppose "Nord Stream 2," which is intended to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it will help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.
However, the Polish judicial system remains one of the reasons for disagreements.
The European Court fined Poland, establishing that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party "Law and Justice" violate EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation has priority over EU rules.
The new government of Germany, sworn in on Wednesday, did not take on public obligations to stop the construction of Nord Stream 2 in case of Russia's invasion of Ukraine despite demands from Poland and the United States.
American officials have informed members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany about stopping the gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a high-ranking employee of the U.S. Congress said on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but on Wednesday Schulz warned of the consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's borders, and this position was confirmed by representatives of the "Big Seven" on Sunday.
Dmitry, look more carefully.
The view outside the window is the same, the size of the window has not changed.
We removed the wall between the kitchen and the room, so you can partially see the second window.
In general, those who are not familiar with the initial planning have doubts.
And I know very well such apartments and perfectly see how it was re-planned.
Let everything be good for them.
It's always surprising when people write about means to clean sinks, toilets, windowsills, and faucets.
Do you wash them only once a year for Easter or something like that, that you have to really scrub them?
Just don't let it get dirty.
Ministry of digital development, communications and mass media wants to present writers with residencies.
The state will transfer federal property remaining from the Union of Soviet Writers and the Literary Fund of the USSR to the Future Fund for the Support of Russian Writers.
According to "Parliamentary Newspaper," writer's residencies will be created on its basis, as reported by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications, and Mass Media, which will become the founder of the fund.
Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media is preparing a draft presidential decree on the establishment of a Fund to support Russian writers.
The explanatory note clarifies that the fund will be tasked with taking care of, among other things, the purposeful use and preservation of buildings and structures that once belonged to the Soviet Union's Writers' Union and Litfund.
"A significant number of real estate properties that previously belonged to the Literary Fund of the USSR, including properties located in the writers' town of Peredelkino, and the settlement of Komarovo in the Leningrad region, and others, have become the property of the Russian Federation," the press service of the Ministry of Finance reported to the "Parliamentary newspaper."
The draft decree requires that the Charter of the Fund reflect that it "is created for the purpose of promoting literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers".
"The term "creating conditions for creative activity" implies the creation of writer's residencies in different regions of Russia based on transferred property, which would provide comfortable conditions for creativity," explained the Ministry of Digital Development to our publication.
520 rubles for one sliced tomato?
Cheese pie is literally a piece of dough from a package that costs 550 rubles.

Doctors warned of the danger of prolonged use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination.
Doctors Irina Yartsyeva and Sergey Tokarev warned about the danger of unmonitored use of blood thinning medications after suffering from COVID-19 coronavirus infection and before vaccination against coronavirus.
Doctor-therapist and immunologist Irina Yartseva explained that independent prevention of possible blood clots after COVID-19 can trigger a stroke.
Yartseva explained that blood thinning medications are not intended for everyone, only if the patient was hospitalized, staying in the ward, and complications were identified.
The doctor prescribes anticoagulants (blood-thinning medications that prevent excessive thrombus formation) according to indications.
She reported that there is currently a frenzy of taking anticoagulants and, as a result, complications such as hemorrhagic strokes (bleeding in the brain) are occurring due to prolonged use by anyone.
The Chief Preventive Medicine Specialist of the Urals Federal District, the scientific director of the Society of Preventive Medicine Specialists, and Doctor of Medical Sciences, Sergei Tokarev, told URA.RU that Russians are now frequently taking anticoagulants haphazardly prior to vaccination against coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe dubious advice on the Internet and start self-medicating.
There are citizens who, one week before the vaccination, by their own decision begin taking anticoagulants.
And during the pre-vaccination examination, doctors notice bruises.
He emphasized that it is extremely dangerous to take any medications without determining the cause of any symptom.
Potatoes were named a superfood for protecting against hypertension.

Around 145 thousand teenagers received the first component of the COVID-19 vaccine in Kazakhstan.
Information has been published on the vaccination of teenagers, pregnant women, and breastfeeding women against coronavirus in Kazakhstan, as reported by Kazinform with reference to the Interdepartmental Commission on the Non-Proliferation of COVID-19.

The plumber who found money in the wall of the church will be paid $20,000.
The plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the American state of Texas will be rewarded.
This is reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident happened at the large evangelical church in Lakewood where pastor Joel Osteen preaches, promising that devout Christians will experience wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Kouli was repairing one of the church toilets and discovered thousands of money packets and checks hidden under the insulation.
He handed over the discovery to the church and, according to him, did not even receive a thank you from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, 'You know, Justin, you did the right thing.'"
"We understand what you have done and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quotes him.
Judging by everything, the find is related to a theft that occurred at Lakeview Church seven years ago.
Then, around 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in the form of checks that were stored in the church safe disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church didn't suffer any losses.
However, a reward of $25,000 was offered for information about the criminals.
Justin Cole could not claim this amount, as the award had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which previously offered a reward of $5,000 and later received an additional $20,000 in donations from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the honesty of a plumber.
He will receive 20 thousand dollars.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned pastor Joel Osteen regarding money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic "as a real person."
Therefore, the attitude towards it is negative.
"And the point is not that "she is financially significantly richer than all the writers," as written here."
There are people who are wealthier, but not all of them behave as arrogantly and provocatively as this madam.

A new case of human infection with bird flu virus has been recorded in China.
A new case of human infection with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N6 has been reported in China.
This was reported by the radio station RTHK with reference to the notification of the Hong Kong health authorities, according to TASS.
A 68-year-old resident of the Huizhou municipal district in the southern province of Guangdong contracted the infection, who had domestic poultry in his household.
His condition is assessed by doctors as critical.
The world's first infection of a human with the H5N6 virus strain was recorded in May 2014 in the southwestern province of Sichuan.
Since then the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
In Brazil, citizens are required to present vaccination passports when entering the country.
In Brazil, it is mandatory to require a COVID passport from those entering the country, according to a decision made by Brazil's Federal Supreme Court judge Luis Roberto Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a vaccination certificate.
Persons arriving from countries where the absence of a vaccine has been proven also fall into the list of exceptions.
"The situation is even more serious when considering that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-Carnival, and Carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow," noted Barroso.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities obliged unvaccinated tourists infected with coronavirus to observe a five-day quarantine.
Scheme for complete protection against COVID-19 has been revealed.
Virologist, doctor of medical sciences and honored scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein revealed a plan for complete protection from coronavirus infection in a conversation with Ura.ru.
According to his words, this can be achieved by administering an injection and using a nasal vaccine.
When applied intranasally, large amounts of immunoglobulin A are formed. This does not occur when the vaccine is administered by injection.
Immunoglobulin A protects the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And after vaccination, the highest amount of immunoglobulins G (antibodies) is formed inside us.
"And if you receive both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is currently no decision on double vaccination," the doctor said.
Sergey Tokarev, the chief preventive medicine specialist of the Urals Federal District and a doctor of medical sciences, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in conjunction with injection vaccination is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help those for whom in such a case, the protection of the body, presumably, should become maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of Nizhny Novgorod region, David Melik-Guseynov, stated that the new surge of COVID-19 pandemic will be caused by the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
According to his words, such a situation is observed in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic arrived earlier.
Inna, um...
I spoke with the male dog (who passed away a long time ago) like this - if you're ready to exchange a warm home, food, affection, love, and playtime for a female dog in heat, then go ahead.
But the dog was trained and generally a smart one.
I was picking my company and walking home.
In the video, there is a method that works in 90% of cases.
It's not taken out of thin air, believe me.
I had to restrain many owners from chasing after their dogs, despite their complaints that 200 thousand (Pomsky dogs) were running away. I would take them by the hand and lead them in the other direction.
In the end, "200 thousand" was chosen by the owner rather than the dog that was running somewhere there.
Mass protests by vaccination opponents continue in Europe.
In the Austrian capital Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
"They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against COVID-19 mandatory."
Starting from February of next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros.
The Spaniards, outraged by the government's healthcare policies, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held posters with the inscription "This is a false pandemic" and "I will not get vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a COVID certificate is mandatory to access bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and nightclubs.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was made by the authorities of several regions in the country against the backdrop of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, over a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The rally started peacefully, but then turned into clashes with law enforcement officers.
A group of demonstrators started throwing stones at police officers.
In response, law enforcement officials used water cannons.
Nikolay S., there is not a single opinion on this matter even in Wikipedia.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also referred to as "the first Russian doctor, medical doctor," probably because she started studying earlier.
Let's just not argue, I believe that both of them deserve this title.
I only agree with Zakharova on one thing: Americans brought only death and looting to any country they appeared in.

WHO has detected "Omicron" in already in sixty countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that the new strain of coronavirus "omicron" has already been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The pace of spread of the strain was discussed in a statement by the WHO.
According to the organization's data, as of December 9th, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it only started spreading actively at the end of November.
The WHO also expresses concern about the high rates of spread of the new variant of coronavirus.
Experts from the World Health Organization express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may surpass the delta variant in terms of distribution. The delta variant, also known as the Indian variant of coronavirus, is currently leading in all countries without exception.
Prior to this, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the Omicron strain is capable of having a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in Great Britain.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "Omicron" will outcompete "Delta" in the coming months.
The number of infected individuals in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that currently only a few hundred people are officially ill with "omicron" in the Kingdom, and according to estimates, up to 10,000 people could be infected.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "Omicron" strain, and at the peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals every day.
What the British healthcare system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "omicron" strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
It is unknown how the Russian Sputnik V vaccine will react to "Omicron" at the moment - this will become clear in the coming weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just started testing the Russian vaccine against the "Omicron" strain.
Why do we need to see the stages of aging?
It would be better to see the execution of your exercises in more detail.
It's not clear in the first exercise how to do it: sitting on the heels or standing on the knees, as written, but then how do you lean your hands on your hips?
Or hands on the hips?
Curious Squirrel, you are right, communication on the internet is completely different, people communicate easily and without constraint, but in personal meetings, they have nothing to say.
And seeing a person in real life, perhaps it's not what you expected, it didn't strike a chord with you - hence the attitude.
When you find your person, then your perspective will change.
And again, Soviet times are called "the time of demons".
Back then, people believed in God much more honestly than they do today.
And they were practically brought up according to God's laws (love for neighbor, do not steal, and so on).
What is the ideology today - money at any cost.
Talkative people like Globs have little (or no) faith, but even if so, the time of demons came in the 90s...
"Our communal apartment in St. Petersburg, or more precisely Leningrad, with Bolshaya Zelenina, still maintains communication to this day."
Of course, we are not the closest friends, but we try to preserve the warmth of the older generation's relationship.
Maybe it's because no one visited the apartment, rooms were not rented out, and the blockade brotherhood was still in effect.
Unfortunately, we are seeing each other more and more often at funerals.
Lara Angelskaya, come on you guys!
Human infants, especially males, are strong, agile, energetic and often behave like their little "siblings" in the natural world - they fuss, push, struggle, and fight.
Unfortunately, they are not as soft as puppies or kittens, so bruises, bumps, and scratches are a common occurrence, and not at all like a boomerang!
And for what?
Did you push your little brother too hard and didn't calculate your strength?
And are you always so agile that you never accidentally touch anyone and have never injured yourself?

The main thing is that the healing process is going on, the hole was just terrible.

The Russian part "Вы так меня не услышали и не поняли" translates to "You did not hear me and did not understand me like that" in English.

Russians have been warned about a new scheme of fraudsters.
Criminals have started to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
This is written about by "Izvestiya" with reference to experts.
According to the director of product for Ivideon, Zaur Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is deepfakes.
In this case, scammers create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this neural network, it is possible to accurately reproduce the behavioral characteristics of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that by using deepfakes, criminals can make video calls to the victim's acquaintances or create a video featuring a copy of a person for distribution with the goal of blackmail.
"Such counterfeits can easily provoke bullying, because a clever fraudster can put people in ridiculous, dangerous, or compromising pseudo-scenarios," said the expert.
Lead Systems Engineer at Varonis, Alexander Vetkol, noted in turn that people psychologically trust others more when they see them.
He emphasized that this may pose specific risks when it comes to technologies that use video.
David, I will add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that all of this was bought in a small town where the local mentality did not allow for dressing too boldly and wearing short skirts, showing stockings and tights on one's legs.
This is a province, but there WAS such a product in the store.
"In big cities, Muslim women would wear makeup and show their legs."
And the same in Dushanbe, it's a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are many trendy things, but there is no such cosmetic.
Listed are five actions that can help prevent diabetes.
Problems with blood sugar levels are one of the most common worldwide.
However, some do not attach much importance to it, and it's a mistake.
Diabetes can eventually lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a key role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the amount of various drinks and switching to plain water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet products raise the level of sugar in the blood to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
The onset of the disease is affected not only by improper nutrition but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, it is necessary to exercise a lot.
Specialists recommend following a low-carb diet.
This type of diet will not only help you lose weight, but also protect you from sharp fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, it is necessary to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fibers fill the stomach and, thus, contribute to the feeling of fullness, secretion of digestive juices, and improved food digestion.

Doctor Pavlova talked about "weekend migraine" in workaholics.
Several factors can contribute to a deterioration in well-being on weekends.
A well-known endocrinologist, Ph.D. in medicine and senior researcher at the faculty of fundamental medicine of Moscow State University, and the scientific director of the Systemic Medicine clinic, Zuhra Pavlova, explained in her Telegram channel that the reason for the worsening of physical condition after working days is often due to the "weekend migraine".
According to her words, workaholics often suffer from this, and experience headaches, fatigue, and weakness during the weekends.
Doctor Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue over the week, there are quite a few objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to the change of conditions.
On weekends, our life changes fundamentally.
"We sleep a lot, lie on the couch all day, probably eat more and drink less," the doctor argued. "A slight breakdown begins due to a lack of coffee."
"Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and fatigue."
Late wake-up plays an additional role.
So, if you wake up three hours later than usual, you will experience a reaction called jet lag.
It arises for travelers who cross multiple time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in worsening one's well-being, Pavlova recommended keeping track of what changes the most on weekends.

South African scientists have reported that Pfizer's vaccine is not very effective against "Omicron".
South Africa announced the low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against "Omicron".
Scientists from the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the Omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimations, the level of neutralization of "omicron" corresponds to a 22.5% effectiveness rate of the vaccine against infection with symptoms, which raises doubts about the vaccine's ability to protect against infection, as stated in the research text published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, specialists clarified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was forecasted that the Omicron strain of coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the United Kingdom, with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in common products?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
His excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that an unfamiliar word in the product composition may indicate hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calories, composition, and glycemic index.
The label may have several dozen names that essentially refer to sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars, such as dextrose (a sugar derived from corn), fructose (fruit sugar), molasses (black treacle), agave syrup, and so on.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery products, but also in ketchup, doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to decrease sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, as well as paying attention to labels and the various names of sugar.
Different types of sugar may have different tastes, but regardless of the name of the ingredient in the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
Calculating the exact amount of sugar is not easy, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the overall amount of sugar may turn out to be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years.
The new Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, has stated that gas imports are losing their importance for Germany as the country continues its transition towards decarbonizing the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil, and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is to say, in 25 years the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role," said the chancellor.
Schultz noted that Germany continues to maintain its commitment to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas, also in the future, because this resource is currently of great importance for the energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the United States have made a statement that fixes the support from Berlin for the energy transformation of Ukraine.
Earlier, the head of the German Foreign Ministry, Annalena Baerbock, stated that the certification process of the "Nord Stream 2" gas pipeline continues.
According to the minister, during coalition negotiations and discussions of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline does not currently "comply with the regulations" of the European Union.

In the year 1985, one had to travel to those regions.

Hackers hacked the Twitter account of the Prime Minister of India.
Hackers hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The criminals managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized bitcoin as a legitimate payment method, and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
At Modi's office, they asked to ignore new messages.
Representatives of the Prime Minister stated that Twitter quickly responded and restored access to the account.
The page of the Prime Minister of India was already hacked in 2020 and calls were made to make donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence.
In New Caledonia, the third referendum that took place on December 12th ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of the residents of New Caledonia voted against the independence of their territory during the referendum.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote became significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted "for" the independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "against".
The turnout was 43.90%, overall more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia participated in the elections.
As commented on by the news agency France-Presse, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt", as supporters of independence called on voters not to participate in the vote.
As initiators of the referendum, they spoke out against its holding on December 12, considering that the new COVID-19 epidemic outbreak in the archipelago hinders a full and "fair" pre-election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for the third victory of supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, and in 2020 - 53.3%.
As stated by the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the latest voting and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12th, at the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to speak on the results of this referendum.
The topic of the independence of New Caledonia has been brought to life during the past weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates spoke in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of presence of the European Union in the Pacific Ocean."
"New Caledonia must definitely remain French," reiterated Eric Zemmour repeatedly.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valeri Pecresse, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October, urging the people of New Caledonia to remain French.
On his part, Emmanuel Macron declared in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility."
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed a "strong desire for the choice of New Caledonians to be the choice of France."
Sveta, oh, hello!
"I was a little bit rude to you... a lot actually, and still feel awkward and ashamed about it."
Thank you for not turning away from my channel.
On the topic: I am not an artist, I love to draw, but the result is an inspired mess.
But as an artist - not to an artist in particular: what can be changed here?
Just don't forget that the food was NATURAL, so obesity wasn't as widespread as it is now.

In Turkey, the first unmanned aerial vehicle with a laser weapon was tested in the world.
Successful tests of the world's first drone with laser weapons were carried out in Turkey.
The drone "Eren" was tested at distances ranging from 100 to 500 meters, according to "MIR24".
The device is capable of neutralizing explosive objects remotely with the help of a laser.
The maximum flight altitude of the novelty reaches 3,000 meters.
After passing the corresponding tests, the drone should be put into service with the Turkish military, who will use it to destroy explosive devices without involving sappers.
The agency emphasizes that Turkey is among the six countries in the world capable of developing and producing their own drones.

WSJ readers criticized an article about Russia and the US relations.
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized Professor Christopher Hartwell's article in which he described his vision of the relationship between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West allegedly sacrifices Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger emanating from Moscow and made a number of insulting statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "unite against Russia."
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"This article contains a lot of false information," quotes RIA Novosti one of the readers' comments.
"Europe is not ours to "lose", and Ukraine is not our land."
"The USA and NATO allies will never engage in a nuclear war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine," noted another.

Ukraine will start producing new generation jet-powered drones.
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish factory they will begin production of the ANKA type jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
On December 11, this was reported by the external advisor to the Ukrainian President's office, Alexey Arestovich.
That is, they are capable of acting against airborne objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aviation.
"They will have Ukrainian engines and other Turkish avionics: body and the like," - quotes him(Dialog.ua).
Commenting on the main features of ANKA aircraft, Arestovich said that they are referring to jet, not piston UAVs.
According to his words, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which surpass it "in all characteristics".
"The first batch of drones must be produced by the factory by the end of next year," concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of a drone was carried out by the authorities of Turkey in cooperation with several private companies since 2010.
On the eve, the Ukrainian General Staff classified information about the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations by the Joint Forces Operation in Donbass.
On December 6, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, announced that the construction of a plant for the production of modern military unmanned aerial vehicles had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma company and Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement for the construction of a center in the Kiev region, where personnel training, testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs will be conducted.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called this memorandum "a big real step forward."
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport.
Lions escaped at Singapore's Changi airport.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from a container with seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the escaped lions lay down on the container roof.
The animals could not move away from him because of the protective mesh set up nearby.
The stand-off ended after the arrival of employees from the Mandai Wildlife Group organization, which manages all Singaporean zoos, at the airport.
They immobilized lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and was roaming the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home and no one was harmed.
Experts have warned about the risk of cancer due to vitamin B9.
Research suggests that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express publication.
According to specialists, there is substantial evidence that people who do not experience a deficiency in folic acid are at a lower risk of getting certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dose actually promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham and dietitian, Beth Kitchen recommends keeping track of the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if there is a significant deviation from this figure in the larger or smaller direction.
Kitchin advises not to take vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, to always monitor the dosage, and to avoid flakes with milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
Nutrition consultant Rachel Fine previously called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
As it is contained among other things in avocado, Fine recommended that men over 50 years old eat this fruit more often.
By April, around 75,000 people may die from the Omicron strain in Great Britain.
Forecasts by British scientists indicate that due to the spread of the Omicron strain of coronavirus, up to 75,000 people in England could die in the next five months if winter restrictions are not tightened.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper with reference to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), according to TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts who are part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies in the British Cabinet, by April 2022, the country will experience no less than 25,000 deaths due to the Omicron variant, while approximately 175,000 patients will be hospitalized in total.
At the peak of the disease, hospitals will be admitting more than 2,000 infected individuals daily.
"Serious measures to combat coronavirus may be necessary to prevent overloading the National Health Service if the Omicron strain proves to be more infectious than the Delta variant, and existing vaccines cannot prevent infections," mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM said.
Earlier, the UK's healthcare security agency informed that if the spread rate of the Omicron strain remains at the current level, around 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country by the end of the year.
By mid-December, the Omicron variant may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At the moment, there are 1898 cases of Omicron coronavirus strain detected in the United Kingdom, out of which 633 were identified in the last 24 hours.
On December 9, British Health Secretary Sajid Javid stated that in reality this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.

Demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter in the world.
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking records worldwide, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and fight climate change.
In the world registry of vessels, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1200 units, which is a quarter more than last year.
In the era of fighting the consequences of climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it's difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress worth 50 million dollars pounds or more will not decrease, writes The Guardian.
However, their number is increasing.
This year, there were ordered 25% more ships than in the previous one.
Brokers say that there hasn't been such excitement on the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to coronavirus.
If before all these people used to go to the office and meet business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely and hold meetings on Zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more just to have their yacht ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People simply thirst for freedom, and the super-rich can afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, according to sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, space travel, life on yachts, or flights on private planes cause irritation in society, since the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists urge governments to take action and propose introducing new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they understand that with such mobility of money, implementing this will be extremely difficult.
Meanwhile, it's not just the number of ordered super yachts that is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Out of 1200 ships, 27 have a stern length above 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a 183-meter long yacht called REV Ocean.
After launching into the water, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht includes a "moon pool" as well as a submarine designed for exploring the depths of the sea.
On existing superyachts, helipads have become commonplace, as have open-air cinemas, and on some of them, such as the yacht of fighter McGregor, a platform for combat. Richard Wilk, a professor of economic anthropology at an American university in Indiana, says that compared to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has a symbolic meaning if you consider that there are slightly more than 2000 billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the carbon footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than the footprint of the average person on the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the biggest polluter of the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that were released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission trail went to his 162.5-meter yacht Eclipse.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the crew continues to pollute the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
Owners of super yachts do not elicit sympathy from other people when they, like the richest woman in Australia Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, complain through YouTube that there is no space for their giant vessels to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for vessels over 50 meters in size.
The dangerous weekly alcohol dose leading to the development of colon cancer has been determined.
American scientists have determined what volume of alcoholic beverages per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is written by the Daily Express publication.
Specialists have concluded that consuming four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
At the same time, the probability of developing the disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, among moderately drinking men, the risk of developing colon cancer is higher than among women.
Scientists cannot identify the exact cause of the development of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child.
Many, or rather all, dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very smart.
But even they do not realize how developed four-legged pets truly are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how intelligence develops in animals.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study shows that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The works of scientists were published in the Sciencealert publication.
Dogs cannot play chess or write poetry, they don't understand anything about politics, economics, and art, yet they often manage to fool their owners.
According to experts, representatives of certain breeds show the best results in understanding human language, but there is currently insufficient statistical data for precise conclusions.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking and in terms of learning ability, they are not inferior to a two-year-old child.

Ukraine is preparing for trade between the US and Russia.
The US and Russia will "negotiate" regarding Ukraine's entry into NATO, according to analyst Alexander Kochetkov in his article for "Glavred" publication.
According to him, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations in the near future regarding guarantees from the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "join wherever they please."
If you are offered something that is clearly unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not haggle, but simply send the offerer away.
"And there is a trade deal being planned regarding Ukraine," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia has no plans to attack Ukraine and strives for dialogue with Kiev.
"They prepare in secret, quickly, and immediately move on to offensive actions, rather than waiting for the grouping to be detected and forces of opposition to be deployed," he noted.
China is stimulating the development of the railway transport industry.
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France, and other countries at the 2021 China International Exhibition of Rail Transportation and Equipment Manufacturing, held in the city of Zhuzhou, Hunan Province, Central China.
Representative of the company, Hou Zhao Wen, noted that the main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. allow the trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions.
High-speed trains that run on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with technologies that ensure increased reliability and performance of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of railway transport vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing the "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first Chinese-designed double-decker high-speed electric trains for export to Europe rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd company.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will operate on railways in Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of a metro train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will move along the metro line that connects the center of Istanbul with the city airport.
The metro line will be opened next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"The Chinese industry for the production of equipment for railway transport is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovative competitiveness," said Feng Yaosyan, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT).
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese high-end equipment manufacturing in the global market," said Feng Yaosyan.
After more than 60 years of intense work, conducting a series of independent research and development, China has created an advanced system for producing railway equipment, with a full range of auxiliary tools and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosyan, the country ranks first in terms of railway electrification levels and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed early signs of dementia.
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semen Golosheykin listed early signs of dementia in a conversation with Sputnik radio.
According to him, signs of future dementia may include forgetfulness, as well as a range of mild cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, plan, and decreased level of abstract thinking.
Currently, there is a discussion about how hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its onset, according to an expert.
Golosheykin emphasized that the causes of dementia may be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and cerebral vascular atherosclerosis are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in a timely manner.
According to him, studying foreign languages and active communication will help to reduce the risk of developing dementia.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity and regularly practicing cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intense memory and logical thinking engagement.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being debated in the scientific community," said Golosheikin.
"Golosheykin said that the World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity and regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logical thinking."
Earlier, a charitable organization for dementia research in the UK stated that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40 and over.
Doctors named early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered problems with vision, due to which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing mental retardation that specialists have identified is aphasia - a condition in which a person cannot find the right words to convey what they want to say.
The neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili abroad for medical treatment.
Former President of Georgia, Mikhail Saakashvili, needs psychological and neurological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, said neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the team of doctors created by the Georgian Ombudsman.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is the leading cause of his illness.
"Stable problems are problems with mobility, coordination, variability of character," said the specialist, noting that this is within the normative framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"We call it neurorehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia," Toidze noted, demanding that Saakashvili be treated at a specialized institution that does not exist in Georgia."
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began sabotaging the receipt of medical care after prison staff subjected him to disciplinary action.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to cancel the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.
Alexandra, "Do you even get paid for this?" - I wonder where these people come from...

Or are we so holy that we feed on prana?

These people are parasites on the body of society.
They do not work, do not pay taxes, live on benefits and at the expense of relatives.
At the same time, they receive complete medical service.
How many mouths can a working person feed?
We feed all the alcoholics, drug addicts who have also lost their health due to their own stupidity.
Then we wonder about the extension of the retirement age.
These sums could be used for treating genuinely sick people.

Protests against COVID passports took place in Spain.
In Spanish cities Barcelona and Valencia, protests took place against the mandatory vaccination certificate for COVID-19, reports Europa Press agency.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the protest was approximately 3,000 people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and nightclubs.
Many protesters came to the rally without masks.
On their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respecting the citizens' choice.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of over 50 people.
The protesters in this city have declared a medical dictatorship and have called vaccination an experiment.
Since the beginning of the pandemic in Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of COVID-19 have been detected, and over 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, restrictions are also planned to be introduced for unvaccinated individuals.
The government introduced bills on a unified system of QR codes to the State Duma on November 12th.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit mass events, cultural institutions, public catering facilities, and retail trade with either a vaccination certificate, proof of a previous illness, or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for train and flight trips.

Steep ascent: how Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international level resorts in the country.
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, allowing President Xi Jinping to collect the designated 1 trillion yuan, but also contribute to the economic development of underdeveloped remote provinces.
The Taivu ski resort in Zhangjiajie, located near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese people.
In addition to infrastructure construction, landscaping work is also being carried out in the region: workers are planting trees.
In the country there are more than 700 ski resorts, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international level competitions.
In many regions of China where resorts are located, including Zhangjiajie, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long-term perspective is to ensure a comfortable and interesting vacation at Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regular visitors.
However, we are still far from that.
Advisor on Game Organization Justin Downs says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every winter, more and more Chinese people head to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite significant changes, it will take many more years to create a skiing culture here, Dauns believes.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and to create necessary infrastructure for recreation.
70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunli, near the venue of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chunli, now none of the local residents suffer from unemployment.
In the country, more and more shops are opening that sell clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes, catering points are opening with dishes of national cuisine.
There is now even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiwan.
China aims to create a thriving winter sports industry, with its athletes becoming leaders in the largest international competitions, and resorts and equipment reaching a global level.
More than 500 million people worldwide could face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, according to the WHO.
More than 500 million people around the world could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed progress towards universal access to health services, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
In connection with the International Day of Universal Health Coverage celebrated on December 12, the WHO and the World Bank have published two complementary reports.
They noted that the pandemic caused disruptions in delivering medical services and created excessive pressure on healthcare systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of the population with immunization has decreased, and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
In the WHO and the World Bank, it was emphasized that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, which is why it has become harder for people to pay for healthcare."
This situation pushes over 500 million people "into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their own pockets."
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the coronavirus pandemic has pushed over 100 million people into poverty, with practically over four billion people lacking social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister was disconnected from the broadcast at the "Summit for Democracy" at the request of the White House.
The speech of Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technology, Audrey Tan, at a panel discussion during the US-organized "Summit for Democracy" was translated into a video-off mode, according to the summit recording on YouTube.
Reuters agency, citing sources, claims that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to their message, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was highlighted in a separate color from the People's Republic of China, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Mrs. Tan was created by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries around the world according to the degree of protection of civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted on it in green as "free", while the PRC, DPRK, Laos, and Vietnam were highlighted in red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government".
China was not invited to the "Democracy Summit."
Reuters sources note that the map demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister could contradict the "One China" policy adhered to by Washington.
One of the agency sources stated that after the demonstration of the map, the United States National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The "Summit for Democracy" organized by Washington took place on December 9-10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society organizations and charities.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, the Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council, Yuri Averianov, stated that the summit had an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".
They're serving you information as if they were cooking food, and everywhere there's stale meat, actually the meat remains with the butcher until the last piece.
The classic of journalism - to create news out of nothing.
They boil not meat, but horns and hooves, obtaining a substance similar to glue.
The finished product looks like a yellow semi-transparent strip with almost no smell, and it is hard like plastic, and is used as a natural gelatin.
In general, there are no fewer harmful substances from waste processing than from its decomposition.
But this saves companies huge amounts of money.
Therefore, a fairytale about ecology was invented for fools who will also work for free to collect garbage for the idea.

Don't lump everyone together - there are bad people out there, and you may have specific grievances against them...
But what does the number of children, age, pension fund, and so on have to do with it?
Write that they are "scoundrels who did not return the money."
But how many and when they should have children, it is not your business until they decide to hang these children on your neck.
And since this is excluded, what right do you have to condemn them?
Probably, it's only like this in education...
Selected (by themselves) parents dictate their own rules, openly disregarding the existing ones.
And if this will concern other areas of life, litigation, etc.?
The laws are not written for them.
And if Dad still implements his own methodology for upbringing and education?
Some kind of horror and a very bad example for others.

The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of China has issued a circular instructing to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where there are land crossing points, in order to further prevent the import of infections from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the specified cities must provide a negative result of a COVID-19 nucleic acid test obtained within 48 hours prior to departure.
Those who arrive in cities where overland checkpoints are located must take at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be effective from the day when the corresponding administrative units of the provincial level determine and publish the zones of the specified cities, up to March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities where land checkpoints are located and which meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Foreign Ministry talked about the "sad outcome" in relations between Russia and the United States.
Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Sergey Ryabkov, in an interview with "Izvestiya", assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
"He noted that the long way of interaction had led to sad conclusions and the problems between the two countries did not start yesterday."
One-sided negative predictability exists, but as for any prospect of improving relationships, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion based on the long journey that we have taken with the current administration, as well as with Trump and Obama.
"The problems didn't start yesterday," the diplomat pointed out.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the US's desire to impose approaches on Russia on many issues.
The Deputy Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects of improving relations and did not expect Washington's position to change.
He explained that progress is not observed except in such areas as strategic stability and cyber security.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that signals will be heard, and Americans will listen to arguments of common sense.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, stated at a meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Moscow is prepared to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warned of the danger of nasal COVID vaccination outside of hospitals.
People who have been vaccinated with a nasal COVID-19 vaccine may develop allergies and need medical assistance. Therefore, it is not advisable to organize the first vaccination centers for this vaccine at airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology at Novosibirsk State University, Sergey Netesov.
To organize vaccination points with the nasal vaccine in airports and shopping centers is easier, but I would do it initially only in medical institutions.
The point is that there is a probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small, but it is desirable for a person to sit next to the doctor's office after that.
"Doctors have special sets of antiallergic drugs that work literally within a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," said Netesov.
According to a virologist, it will be possible to consider vaccination in shopping centers when experience in the use of the vaccine has been accumulated.
He also emphasized that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important for it to reach the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
In this case, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its intended destination if the vaccinated person blows their nose after injection while having nasal congestion.

"Lama, they say, true believers make up the church."
Whether these true believers exist or not, we cannot know.
Each of us would like to be a truly faithful believer, and each one tries to be one.
But no one should say about themselves or about those who believe like them that they are the only true believers.
Because if they can say about themselves that they are truly believers, then others can say the same thing.

In my opinion, he shouldn't be upset about the advertisement constantly popping up.

In Great Britain, 1239 cases of the Omicron strain of coronavirus were recorded in one day - RT in Russian.
Over the course of the day in the United Kingdom, 1239 cases of infection with the new Omicron strain of coronavirus have been detected.
This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the "omicron" strain have been reported in England, 38 people have fallen ill with the new variant in Scotland, and five people in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in Great Britain has reached 3137 people.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine made a pessimistic forecast that by April, due to the outbreak of the "Omicron" strain of coronavirus, 75,000 people may die in England.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions.
The press secretary of the president of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of the continuation of "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including the alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
"It is impossible to impose any restrictions against Russia and not suffer oneself," said the official representative of the Kremlin on the Russia 1 TV channel.
Peskov declares that "everyone in the world understands this."
Earlier it was reported that the United States is considering the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
Additionally, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, Sberbank CEO Herman Gref is convinced that this is impossible.

The residents of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France.
According to the final results of the third referendum on independence for New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave France.
On December 12th, this was reported by the French TV channel BFM.TV.
"96.5% of those who voted were against independence."
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were annulled.
The level of participation in the voting on that day was very low: about 55% of the residents of the archipelago came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by the separatists' calls to refuse to participate in the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the residents of New Caledonia expressed their opposition to independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum was already held in the region on the issue of independence.
The majority of residents supported the presence of the archipelago as part of France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometers away from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
About 270 thousand people live on the archipelago, which has a special administrative and territorial status.
There is an agreement between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia dated 1998, according to which the region can hold a vote on its independence twice with a two-year gap.

The WHO tentatively considers "Omicron" to be less dangerous than "Delta".
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily believes that "Omicron" is less dangerous than the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there is data on the decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines when infected with a new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9th, "Omicron" has been registered in 63 countries according to the information.
"Preliminary data and significantly altered antigenic profile of the protein strain "omicron" suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant."
According to preliminary conclusions from South Africa, it is expected that it ("severity of illness" - ed.) may be less severe than with "delta", - says the technical message from WHO.
The organization notes that so far, all registered cases of "Omicron" infection in the EU proceed easily or asymptomatically.
However, according to preliminary data, the new strain spreads faster than the "delta" variant.
Two cases of Omicron strain infection have been registered in Russia.
"They had been previously immunized," reported the Gamaleya Center.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, stated that there is currently no reliable data to suggest that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios have been named for Zelensky.
Former Member of Parliament of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four possible scenarios for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's developments in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may lose the support of the West and, possibly, make compromises on Donbass.
Denisenko talked about this on Sunday, December 12, in a post on the "Glavred" portal.
The first scenario, which Denisenko called the "perfect storm," suggests that Ukraine will stop being supported by key Western countries, having reached an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such a development of events will contribute to a deep crisis that Kyiv may face in 2023.
"Simultaneously, there is a decrease in prices for key goods, which we traditionally export <...> internal protests and resistance of the government with key FPGs (financial-industrial groups) ", added the former parliamentarian."
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "a war against everyone".
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, whereby the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to such a situation, the leadership of Ukraine may compromise on Donbass, which could result in internal confrontation within the country.
At the end of summer, Zelensky's positions will weaken, with the probability of such a situation, according to a former member of parliament, being up to 50-55%.
The third scenario for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is a confrontation between dissatisfied groups of the population and President Zelensky, which may lead to the seizure of control over the security forces and the implementation of "populist initiatives".
"During such a crisis scenario, Zelensky will begin a "reformatting of power,"" Denisenko added.
Another scenario is turning Zelensky into the "father of the nation".
This can be caused by some event that will be a strong shock to society.
"The event must be significant enough to elicit a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," said Denisenko.
Former deputy believes that such a scenario of events is possible as a result of natural disasters, technological catastrophes, or aggressive actions of Russia.
At the same time, the Russian side has already rejected any possibilities of "attacking" Ukraine more than once.
In Moscow, it was noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO, and the United States who are increasing military activity near Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11th, survey data from the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president had dropped to record low levels, reaching 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since he was elected as the head of state.
The analysts predicted a situation where in case of the upcoming presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% of the voters would give their vote to Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for the ex-president of the country, Petro Poroshenko.
At the same time, only 19.3% of all surveyed expressed their support to the president.

Thank you to the author for the story about the great athlete. I didn't know that Elena Shushunova had died, it's very sad to find out.
"I remember how I cheered for her at the Olympics in Seoul. For us, residents of the Primorsky Krai, it was live broadcast, real time."
Such high intensity of passions, emotions were overflowing, I remember the joy when Elena won.
They also celebrated other victories, cheering for Salnikov, for football players, and for all Soviet athletes at that time.
On TV, I once saw a documentary film about one of the Central American countries, and they were rolling watermelons onto the ship's deck like barrels.
The watermelons were of monstrous sizes.
I myself worked many times in my youth on cleaning and loading watermelons in the Astrakhan region and never came across watermelons weighing more than a pud.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg straight from the garden and not earlier than the beginning of August.
Balconette bra with soft lace cups (size: 90E, color: beige, composition: 90% polyamide, 10% elastane, article number: 12008).
Balconette bra with soft lace cups, on underwires.
The bottom part of the cup is reinforced with non-elastic transparent fabric.
The side inner part of the cup in the area where the straps are attached is reinforced with non-elastic fabric at the fold, without additional seams for comfort.
This element is what prevents lace from stretching.
The richness of the lace can be assessed by the scalloped edge along the neckline and under the bust.
Vertical bones on the side panels made of single-layer microfiber prevent the fabric from twisting on larger sizes.
I really didn't like the article, it was angry and poisonous.
Walked among people whom you know nothing about.
But now many people enjoy breaking down things into atoms.
I hope that those who comment with honor and decency are doing well and are experts in everything.

The poet arrested for his action on Red Square: "They give 10 days for quoting Yevtushenko, that's the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student from HSE was detained on Red Square with a poster that had the hashtag #poetinrussiamorethanpoet written on it.
This quote belongs to the writer Evgeny Evtushenko.
Alexander was drawn up a protocol under the administrative article on repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public event.
He was first detained on January 23 at Pushkin Square during a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry as a whole. Unfortunately, interest in it has been lost amid the decline of culture in Russia. There is also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their own verses on the internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his arrest and to further reveal the message of his message.
How were you treated by the police officers during this and previous detentions?
What were they asking in the department and how did they comment on your action?
This time the employees were more professional; the arrest was maximum, courteous, even though it may sound funny in some context of this word.
At Pushkinskaya, the OMON officers took people and took them harshly.
They asked standardly about the motives.
When they heard, they looked at it, if not approvingly, then understandingly.
Except for the monkey cage ventilated on all 4 sides, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew what I was getting into.
And if after the campaign under this hashtag, people start writing their own poems, even if it's just a few people, then these 10 days will not have been in vain for me.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak privately even in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events, they speak in the language of those around them, so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through a translator.
This is a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian perfectly and yet uses the help of a translator.
And also at official events, a transcript is kept using an old-fashioned pen, and the stenographer is not required to know multiple languages.
If you don't want to say a lot of words, just say no!

Researchers have explained how potatoes can help fight age-related disorders.
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that contribute to improving blood circulation and reducing cholesterol levels.
Root crops contain vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic acid, and pantothenic acid.
All these elements help the systems of the body to function.
In addition, potatoes help to combat age-related disorders.
Thanks to its high fiber content, it is beneficial for the digestive system, and regular consumption can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for maximum benefit, the root vegetable is best stewed or boiled, rather than fried in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other foods with a high glycemic index.
These are products with a high content of carbohydrates that quickly break down into sugars, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned about a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a decrease in its production in personal subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the current product shortage can only be compensated by imports.
"Yandex" will remove Lostfilm, Lordfilm and other pirates from search results.
Candidates for departure.
In 2015, the rights holders from the cluster "RAEC/Media" compiled a list of the top 100 pirate sites in the Runet, and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, CEO of the Internet Research Institute.
"But some of them - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks in part to regularly changing their domain name," he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in search results on both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Squid Game" and Anna Melikyan's "Tenderness" - the original series of Russia's largest video service, ivi (a part of the AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto", but judging by the video quality, it is a so-called screencast (a pirated copy of the movie filmed in a cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the TV series "Univer. 10 years later" from the TNT channel (part of "Gazprom-media") is available.

A wide circle surrounded by "molecules" of light provides the most even and bright illumination of the space.
"Atomic" or "molecular" design, reflecting the essence and natural nature of each object, does not lose its relevance and allows you to strategically place accents in the interior.
One of the characteristic features of such lamps is the weightlessness of the design.

Dimax Micro Ultimate Mattress, size 160x190.
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient because it has two different surfaces in terms of softness - high stiffness and slightly above average.
The product includes only high-quality and premium fillers that have proven themselves exceptionally well.
Springs: At the center of the model is a block of independent springs called "micropacket".
This means that there are 2000 coils in the bed that work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that provides a unique pinpoint adjustment.
"Microcoil" is the highest frequency of all the variety of spring blocks from "Dimax", therefore it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: above and below the springs, combinations of layers of coconut coir and natural latex are installed.
The only difference is the order of the tiles.
"If one surface has latex, then the other has coconut coir."
Such a tandem of fillers has long been carrying the status of classical, as it imparts to the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If the coil provides proper back support, then latex provides adaptation of the surface under the human body.
Cover: The model comes with a quilted Aloe Vera knit cover.
At the client's request, it can be made both removable and stationary.
The overall height of the product is 27 cm, and the recommended weight capacity for the sleeping area is 170 kg.
Guarantee and safety: the warranty period is 3 years.
The mattress has obtained all necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in use.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress has the CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus.
"The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in its atmosphere," Aktualnaya Camera reported on Sunday.
The goal of missions launching in five years is to assess the habitability of the clouds of Venus and then search for life there.
For the Tartu project, scientists from Tartu proposed tools for measuring acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
Until now it was thought that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally a terrestrial planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus is expected to arrive.
Let's suppose that if we find life there, then the main question will be - is it similar to earthly life or different.
If it is very similar, then it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
"If it is different, then it is possible that it becomes more likely that life originated on Earth," said the head of the Estonian team of the "Venus Life Finder" project, Mihkel Päusalu.

Multiverses will change Russian business.
The topic of metaverses became popular in the fall of this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
So, business in Russia, as well as around the world, will invest in creating their own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Multiverses should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions in the conditions of a pandemic, since people are tired of isolation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is a consequence of businesses' striving to develop ecosystems and adapt their operational models to them.
In the third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art, and even money transition into a digital format.
Anya, you are right, changing your diet is a conscious process.

You can eat with a spoon, try it - and that's enough.
After all, there really are ten days off ahead, so you can prepare any tasty and healthy dishes.

The British economist was unable to provide a forecast for 2022.
British economist Jim O'Neill couldn't provide a forecast for 2022, as he believes that such attempts would fail.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change direction.
He believes that the most important factor is still the coronavirus pandemic, and in second place is inflation.
O'Neill also admitted that he doesn't know if the price increase on goods is temporary or not.
As indicated by the specialist, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of endless generosity of central banks has already outlived itself" and it is time to return to relationships where interest rates, taking into account inflation, will correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, continuing the ultra-soft economic policies could lead to a new surge of inflation, according to some experts.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of increasing productivity, as well as the increase in poverty levels and climate change, summarized O'Neill.
Earlier, the head of global research department at "Otkrytie Investitsii", Mikhail Shulgin, reported that positive expectations for the US dollar exchange rate in 2022 still remain, although the potential for growth will be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar exchange rate, Shulgin named the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, the dynamics of oil prices, and concerns against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic.

Russians gave about 4.5% of the country's GDP to car dealers.
According to the statistical data from the Russian Automotive Market Research agency (NAPI), Russians spent 2.784 trillion rubles on purchasing new cars in the first 10 months of 2021, which is 28% more compared to the same period last year.
To understand the scale - approximately the same amount (around 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the government to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, during a meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization countries, President Vladimir Putin stated that this amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's GDP for 2020.
In terms of income on the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is leading.
During the first 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than the previous year.
The related Kia brand of Hyundai has an even larger growth of over 35%, and the revenue from car sales is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
This brand is in the lead position in terms of increasing the average weighted price of the car - for the year, Hyundai's price has increased by almost 21%, up to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had a stronger increase in price.
At the same time, sales volumes for Korean brands did not increase significantly: according to statistics from the Committee of Automobile Manufacturers of the Association of European Business in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more cars in quantitative terms for the same period than the previous year.
Hyundai - nearly by 12%.
Japanese Toyota is closing the top three leaders in terms of sales volume in monetary terms - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than the previous year.
Mercedes-Benz follows the Japanese with a turnover of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has experienced growth in both sales volume (by 37%) and the average price of the car (by almost 28%, up to 8.2 million rubles).
"At Mercedes-Benz, we are seeing a good growth in sales and average prices - more than, for example, BMW - hence the greater growth in financial capacity," explained the CEO of NAPI, Tatiana Arabadzhi."
"Chinese brands are demonstrating fantastic sales growth rates, and have significantly increased their financial capacity this year."
The Russian brand Lada demonstrates average market growth dynamics in terms of income (plus 28%), with Russians spending 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months.
Companies whose car sales in units fell in 2021, such as Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, and Nissan, are at the same level of financial capacity as last year.
UAZ is even in the negative - over 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand, compared to 12.4 billion rubles the year before.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of auto components and production disruptions that have affected the entire global automotive industry, car companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AvtoVAZ" raised the cost of Lada models seven times a year, with the latest price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurring at the end of November.
Other car manufacturers regularly update the prices of their products.
The volumes of the Russian automobile market, in monetary terms, will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation and the desire of car companies to make up for past losses contribute to this, experts believe.
In conditions of a shortage of cars, I think that many car manufacturers were able to partially shift the costs of past periods onto the consumer, which they could not include in the price of cars before.
Says VTB Capital analyst on the automotive industry, Vladimir Bespalov.
I believe that in financial terms, automotive manufacturers are feeling very good right now, maintaining high sales margins.
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rates of the cost of cars observed during 2021, with prices for new cars rising faster than inflation, according to the expert.
In the long term perspective, the market will grow both in quantity and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the increased complexity of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
As supply grows, possibilities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian automotive market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the increase in the cost of cars slows down. Car manufacturers will be able to generate their income through volume, notes independent automotive consultant Sergei Burgazliev.
"Given the high demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are currently striving to get the maximum profit from each sold car," notes Burgazliev.
An increase in the volume of car production is not expected for at least the next six months, and in Russia, the hype is also fueled by citizens' uncertainty about the future.
Against the backdrop of the situation that has developed in the market, cars have turned out to be a good investment object - an expert notes that a car that was bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its initial cost.
Biden spoke about the redeployment of US military to Ukraine in the event of Russia's invasion.
The US leadership never considered sending American military to Ukraine in case of a "Russian invasion."
President of the United States, Joe Biden, made such a statement.
"There were never such plans," said the head of the White House, responding to a journalist's question about whether the U.S. had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalates, Russia will face economic consequences.
He emphasized that the US and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in case of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American forces unilaterally to defend Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the US will relocate forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Estonia).
"We will have to redirect more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries which we have a sacred obligation to defend against any aggression from Russia," Biden declared.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov emphasized that Moscow has no intentions of invading the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use of drones supplied to Kiev by Turkey, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory".
I immediately leave such interviews.

Promtex-Orient Monolit Combi mattress 16 100x185 cm.
The Promtex-Orient Monolith Combi 16 mattress of non-spring construction with an average height is made of alternating layers of natural latex and coconut coir.
One side is medium-firm, the other is moderately firm.
Elegant white jacquard cover quilted with polyester padding and enhanced with a zipper around the perimeter.
Two types of filler.
The sandwich model consists of eight layers of fillers.
Thin plates of coconut coir are laid between latex plates.
The layered structure of the mattress is characterized by increased wear resistance, durability, and resistance to loads.
Natural latex is a dense, elastic and breathable material.
The filler maintains its shape and quickly recovers after loads.
Coconut fiber strengthens the durability of the product and naturally possesses antimicrobial properties.
Combining these two materials allows for the creation of a durable and orthopedic sleeping place that will serve buyers for many years.
Universalism and orthopedic support.
The mattress is suitable for people of different body types and ages.
The medium firm surface is versatile with a balanced combination of orthopedic support and comfort.

A moderately firm sleeping surface is more relevant for those who need to "unload" their back and maintain a healthy posture.
The mattress is suitable both for a single person and for a couple.
The last ones will especially appreciate the presence of a stable surface and the absence of the "wave effect" when vibrations on one side of the mattress can be transmitted to the opposite side, disturbing a person's sleep.

If a scammer calls from a number like this, claiming to be a "worker of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another law enforcement agency, it is not effective to immediately hang up, but rather to add the number to the blacklist, which you may not have time to do.
Because in order to confirm his lie about involvement with law enforcement agencies, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to scare and persuade.

And from the looks of it, I can even smile at you.
But I remember that thoughts are material!

The film "Student" by Alexander Sokurov won the European "Oscar" for Best Editing.
The Russian movie "Unclenching Fists," which was nominated for an Oscar, has been awarded the European Film Academy Award (also known as the "European Oscars") in the "Best Editing" category, according to "Moskovsky Komsomolets."
The competition jury, who voted online due to the complicated epidemiological situation, evaluated the outstanding skills of the film creators.
The film "Quo Vadis, Aida?" by Jasmila Žbanić (Bosnia) received the highest number of awards this time.
The main character of the film is a translator for the UN mission who tries to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for the drama "Unclenching Fists", directed by Kira Kovalenko (a graduate of Alexander Sokurov's workshop), this film is about the complex relationships between an authoritarian father and his growing children who want to break free from his guardianship in North Ossetia.
It was previously announced that this film was nominated for the Academy Award as the Best Foreign Language Film.
As regular friendly meetings of the Presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey show, in my opinion, you are not up to speed, to put it mildly.
