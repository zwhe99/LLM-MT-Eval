"I just don't feel like watching TV anymore because there are things like that."
Does that mean that becoming a comedian has become too difficult? Because TV is filled with comedians.
Yesterday, I watched "Iroha Chidori" on Netflix, but there were quite a few scenes where the staff behind the scenes would laugh out loud even when the conversations weren't particularly interesting.
It's really eerie how they try to flatter and laugh at everything a popular comedian says, even if it's not really funny, just because "they're a successful comedian".
"But if the staff don't laugh, it might hurt the comedian's mood and make things awkward in terms of work relationships."
That industry is like an old black company and it seems like a lot of people there have a sports team-like mentality. Some entertainers have big egos and can show unpleasant attitudes. They probably have to do that to survive.
On the other hand, there are a lot of cases where comedians themselves excessively emphasize the difficulty of their work and insist on the "don't underestimate comedians" argument.
"I know that the income is considerably low until one becomes popular, but even if people keep saying that being a comedian is one of the most difficult jobs, it doesn't really matter to me."
It sounds like a justification for beautifying one's own career and the excessive stature of comedians in the media and society.
To be honest, there are some tough parts in the industry I work in, but I feel like things related to the world of entertainers are becoming increasingly difficult to handle.
I'm sorry for complaining so much.
I felt like it's not good for my body if I don't let it out like a fart...

The item I ordered from Tsukumo Net Shop was replaced without my permission.
Summary: I ordered a wireless mouse that had become cheaper, but received its wired version. They asked me to return the product if I wanted a refund.
It's not so much about building your own PC as it is about problems with online shopping. I can't come to terms with it no matter how I think about it, and since it's from a well-known place, I'm going to write about it here.
The trigger was discovering that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was being sold for 3,280 yen (preserved link) at Tsukumo Net Shop's Tsukumo Day Sale which started from the previous Friday.
At the store, the wired version was the same price, so considering the possibility of a pricing error, I also checked the page for the wired version and found it was 5,071 yen (archive link), so I considered the possibility that it wasn't a mistake and placed an order.
The order email was received correctly and the shipping email was also received the next day.
The name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written in both of these emails and in the purchase history on my page.
I thought the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive at this point because there was no indication of mistake or cancellation notice from ordering to shipping.
The problem starts from here, and a few hours after shipping, an email arrived saying "there was a mistake in registering the product".
According to that email,
They were selling the wireless version at a sale price, but in reality, it was a wired version.
"We have already shipped the wired mouse."
1. Refuse to receive and cancel everything.
2. Return only the mouse and receive a refund.
3. Use the wired mouse as is.
Choose the appropriate response.
The product pages for the wired and wireless versions are separated, and despite the purchase history, email, and invoice all stating "wireless version," it seems they sent the wired version without permission.
Isn't it terrible to be sent something different from the purchased item without agreement, and then be asked to return it if you want a refund?
"Even if I ultimately accept a refund, I want to strike back somehow. Please lend me your wisdom."
If you were looking for a partner or doing marriage hunting, would you not want to date someone who has a bad relationship with their family?
Or is it unrelated?
If you don't mind me asking, why do you care?
For example, people who have cut ties with their parents or siblings.
It doesn't matter.
The reason why relationships can be bad is because there are various personalities and unreasonable people, whether they are parents or siblings.

Isolated twice...The only bridge connecting the district was washed away by a typhoon and heavy rain. Residents have tripled their emergency food supplies. <Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture> (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News.
Mr. Yoshirou Matsumoto from Takaharu district, Yaba-cho, Fukushima prefecture.
The 2019 Typhoon in eastern Japan greatly impacted the life of 8 people living in 3 households.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: "At first, it's like 'Seriously?'."
"It felt like it was so easy to break or get swept away" The only road leading to the Takachihara district, "Takachihara Bridge," was washed away by Typhoon Hagibis, leaving 30 people from 11 households in the district stranded.
The residents who were forced to have their water shut off continued carrying necessary supplies by using the JR railway bridge, which is normally not allowed for passage.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto said, "Normally, cars can come up to the garden, but over there, we have to get off the car and carry or carry on our backs, and walk over the iron bridge to get here. So, we appreciated the convenience of having a car for transportation." The temporary bridge, which was completed a month later, was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months, and the area became isolated again for several days until a temporary bridge was set up.
"Two years have passed since the disaster and restoration has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto continues to implement measures based on the lessons learned."
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases."
"For now, I thought it would be good to secure at least 2-3 days' worth of food," they said. They have prepared about 3 times as much emergency food, such as canned food and cup noodles, as before the disaster.
Ms. Misako Matsumoto said, "It's not just about someone else's problem. We never know when a disaster will strike ourselves, so I feel it's important to have some emergency supplies and preparations." On the other hand, Yabu Matsuri town experienced an "unexpected disaster" where bridges were washed away.
To not forget the lessons, we started our own town initiative from 2021.
Yamatsuri-cho Education Department, Chief Ryuuichi Takahashi: "We have established 'Yamatsuri-cho Disaster Prevention Day' and have also announced that we would like to continue to make October 12th a day to consider preparation for disasters starting from next year."
"I think awareness of the possibility of unexpected events happening has increased more than ever before."

"Experience the Paramarathon in VR (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! News."
On December 12, 2021, Tokyo held an event where people could run the Paralympic marathon course that was recreated digitally.
This event was held to allow people to experience the new excitement of sports and the charm of Tokyo's tourism through digital means.
At the venue, running machines and road bikes were prepared, and visitors to the venue wearing dedicated equipment were racing through a marathon course of the Paralympics that was reproduced in a virtual space.
On each tablet where a virtual space is displayed, a personal avatar appears, and participants from both domestic and international locations can compete while running on the marathon course, providing an experience where they can enjoy tourist spots in Tokyo as well.
The participants said, "...the scenery changed so much and it was really fun."
"While running through the streets of Tokyo like this, it can be tough while running but it's so much fun to be able to enjoy it. Also, I'm glad I was able to keep going until the end while competing with everyone." The city official said, "In the future, we hope to make it enjoyable even at sports gyms, and we plan on installing it early next year."

The text is asking whether high school students are also eligible to apply for recruitment that is advertised as being open to students in general, including college students, through apps or other means.
In general, when we say "student" it refers to college/university students.
In case of high school students, they are called "seito" which means "student," but they can also be referred to as "gakusei" which also means "student."
Therefore, it is faster and more reliable to confirm such things directly.

The pitfalls of the "Building Condition Survey System" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
● The newly established "building condition survey" system towards revitalizing the second-hand housing market has resulted in a strong performance for second-hand housing transactions.
Both detached houses and condominiums are seeing an increase in prices and the home renovation market is also expanding.
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, there has been an increasing trend towards owning one's home. At the same time, there has been a surge in popularity for properties represented by words such as "near the station", "large-scale", and "tower", which have become more expensive, leading to a relative shortage of affordable new properties.
[View images of this article] However, compared to overseas, the share of existing (used) housing distribution in Japan still remains at a low level.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) partially revised the Land and Building Transaction Law and started a building condition survey, known as inspection, aimed at secure and safe transactions of used homes (https: / /www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which a skilled architect familiar with residential construction checks the current condition and status of the building, including its deterioration, and then summarizes the information in a report to be presented to the buyer.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism explains that the introduction of inspections benefits both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid post-delivery claims by conducting a property investigation before the transaction and giving the buyer a sense of security.
This ultimately leads to differentiation from competing properties.
On the other hand, it is an system where buyers of used homes can understand the condition of the home they plan to purchase and make a satisfactory purchase. At first glance, it is a system with great advantages.
Simply put, under the current system, mainly the seller has the authority to lead the investigation of the condition of the building.
In addition, I would like to draw attention to the fact that only the notification of the inspection system has become mandatory.
In other words, a real estate agent responsible for intermediation has an obligation to explain whether or not they can introduce an architect to conduct a building condition survey during property intermediation, but actually implementing it is not mandatory.
While there are concerns related to seller-led inspections, on the other hand, if we look overseas, in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom where the secondhand market is thriving, similar systems have already been established.
In the preliminary stage of buying and selling a house, there is a system where the buyer requests a building inspection from a specialist referred to as an "inspector" or a "building surveyor."
For example, in the case of the United States, depending on the state, inspections are conducted in 70-90% of used home transactions.
The nature of the Japanese-style inspection, which is mainly focused on the seller, is significantly different from the point that the "buyer" takes the lead in conducting the inspection.
Sellers try to make the condition of the building look as good as possible and sell it quickly and at a high price if possible.
On the part of the buyer, they are carefully examining the inspection details and are considering living with peace of mind by making appropriate repairs.
Even though it's the same inspection, there is a discrepancy in both parties' goals and intentions.
Therefore, the following points have been pointed out as concerning risks regarding the Japanese system.
● The scope of the inspection based on the seller-led standards set by the country is kept to a minimum.
Because it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking important issues. For inspection companies, intermediary companies (sellers) who introduce clients are considered customers.
Therefore, there is a possibility that an "inspection" with "consideration" may be conducted, such as not reporting inspection results that are disadvantageous to the seller.

As it was only the second time in the year, I thought I could take a break for about a month and easily say goodbye to the crummy company. However, the illness turned out to be more severe than I thought, and the medicine didn't work well. It lingered on for a long time.
Anyway, it's important to seek proper treatment at a psychiatry department and keep a record of your visits (very important).
If you have a medical history of visiting the hospital, even if you quit due to personal reasons, you can have it changed to being laid off due to company reasons based on the doctor's judgment at the Hello Work office, so the hurdles to receive unemployment insurance and so on will drop significantly.
Even if you can't find a job easily and want to take a little break, you can still have some financial and mental flexibility.

Ginza was an island?
5 trivia facts to talk about while wearing a silver mask (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
"This place used to be a peninsula."
"As proof, being able to show off even a little bit of trivia is something unique to Ginza."
Let me introduce some interesting Ginza trivia that you will want to share with someone for sure once you know it.
Go above Ginza?! (This is not a complete sentence, so the meaning may depend on the context.)
First infiltration into the gold seat.
When you walk in Ginza, you can see traces of the history that Ginza has engraved everywhere, such as peculiar place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines.
While walking in Ginza with her, suddenly in the midst of silence, he said "You know, this place used to be a peninsula a long time ago."
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
"Ginza" in Tokyo's Chuo ward is a symbol of a bustling commercial district that has created "xxx Ginza" throughout various regions in Japan.
In the first place, "Ginza" refers to a mint that produced silver coins, and in 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza office that had been located in present-day Shizuoka City was relocated to Edo.
At that time, it was called "Shinryogae-cho", but when it moved to the Oyster Shell Town, it came to be called by the nickname "Ginza".
By the way, it is said that the Ginza area used to be a "peninsula" that protruded into the sea.
From before the Edo period, there were inlets extending from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and from Nihonbashi to Ginza there was a peninsula called "Edo Maeshima."
The tip of that peninsula corresponds to present-day Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu established the shogunate in Edo, he filled in the bay and progressed the development of the Kyobashi district.
Furthermore, Ieyasu established city blocks and dug moats surrounding them to promote water transportation.
And so, they dug out the moat, broke down Mount Kanda, and filled in the bay.
There is a monument called "Birthplace of Ginza" indicating the former site of Ginza City Hall (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku) around the front of the Tiffany & Co. flagship store in Ginza. Those who are interested may want to try and find it.
"The Holy Land Pilgrimage" of Ginza, known to those in the know.
In Ginza, there is a well-known annual event called "Ginza Haccho Shrine Pilgrimage", which is a pilgrimage to a sacred site known only to the initiated.
Among the more than 10 holy places, the most eye-catching is probably the "Kabuki Inari Shrine" in front of the Kabuki-za theater.
On the right end of Kabuki-za, there is a shrine where many people offer prayers before and after watching the performance.
Meanwhile, the "Ryuko Fudo" is located on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuya, and the "Ginza Shusse Jizo" is located on the 9th floor Ginza Terrace of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
The "Hodoto Inari Shrine," "Azuma Inari Shrine," and "Toyo Iwa Inari Shrine" are located in the back alleys and are not very noticeable, but the "Toyo Iwa Inari Shrine" is known for being revered by the famous Kabuki actor Ichimura Uzaemon. Additionally, the "Success Inari Shrine" located in the entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building 1F is not open to the public except during the Hachiman Shrine pilgrimage.
This shrine tour includes places where Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bodhisattva are enshrined, but most shrines have Inari as the main enshrined deity.
The "Inari Shrine," where a fox greets you in front of the main hall, is often built in areas with many farmers because it has the benefit of a rich harvest of the "five grains" or "bumper crop."
As a result, in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, it came to be said that there were blessings of prosperity in business, and even in Ginza, Japan's leading commercial district, faith began to spread.

They said it was to reduce the pain quickly.

Did most of the military personnel during the Greater East Asian War consist of national civil servants?

As the military itself is an organization of the state, those who have been drafted through conscription can be considered as state officials within the organizational structure.

A man's body was found in the Shonai River in Moriyama Ward, Nagoya (Chukyo TV NEWS) - Yahoo! News.
On the morning of the 12th, a man was found lying face down and dead in the Shonai River in Moriyama Ward, Nagoya City.
"The police are investigating the identity and cause of death of a man."
According to the police, on the morning of the 12th before 11:30 am, a passerby found a man lying face down in the Shonaigawa River in Nakashidami, Moriyama-ku and reported it to 110 (emergency phone number).
The man was rescued from the river, but it has been confirmed that he died at the scene.
The police are hurrying to confirm the identity and investigate the cause of death, among other things.
On the other hand, a man in his 70s was found lying in the river in Fukuoka-cho, Okazaki City and was confirmed dead.
There were no signs of disarray in the man's clothing, but it was reported that a bicycle had fallen nearby.

According to Korean news, Posco International, a South Korean company, has acquired Senex Energy in Australia, expanding its overseas gas field operations.
On the 12th, Posco International announced that it had entered into a stock purchase agreement with Australian company Senex Energy, as well as an investment agreement towards the acquisition of Hancock Energy and Senex Energy.
Currently, there are procedures remaining such as approval from the local companies and the approval at the Senex Energy shareholders meeting, and the acquisition process is expected to be completed in March of next year.
This acquisition will become the largest global merger and acquisition (M&A) case for POSCO International since its integration into the POSCO Group in 2010.
The acquisition amount is 770.9 billion won in total, of which POSCO International decided to invest 50.1%, and Hancock Energy decided to invest 49.9%.
POSCO International explained that it decided on this acquisition because the demand for natural gas is expected to continue to increase sustainably even in the era of energy conversion, and blue hydrogen based on natural gas infrastructure is anticipated to split the market with green hydrogen in the hydrogen market.
Posco International will acquire 802 billion cubic feet (802 Bcf) of natural gas reserves in Korea, which is equivalent to 44% of the country’s natural gas consumption in 2019, and also secure onshore gas field human resources in Australia.

Originally, there was only one national holiday in February, which was on the 11th to commemorate National Foundation Day. However, because the current emperor was born in February, the 23rd of February has become a national holiday.
However, the previous Emperor's birthday on December 23rd fell on a weekday, so the number of days in the year did not change.
That knee pain, perhaps it might be "osteoarthritis of the knee"?
"Medical treatments vary depending on the cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News."
Editorial department: Lately, I've been experiencing ongoing pain in my knees.
What are the possible illnesses?
Mr. Maruyama: The causes of knee joint pain vary, including injuries, rheumatoid arthritis, gout attacks, and others.
Among them, the most common among Japanese people is "osteoarthritis."
Editorial department: Does it mean the joints are deformed?
Maruyama Sensei: Yes.
In its natural state, the surface of the joints is covered by cartilage, which plays a role in cushioning impacts and making joint movements smoother.
However, due to factors such as aging, obesity, and intense sports, cartilage can wear down or become deformed.
As a result, it leads to joint deformity or inflammation.
Editorial Department: Does osteoarthritis occur in areas other than the knee?
Maruyama sensei: Yes.
It can also occur in joints such as the fingers, neck, waist, big toe, and hip joint, not just in the knees.
However, the most common case is when it occurs in the knee, and it is called "osteoarthritis of the knee."
Editorial Team: What is the structure of joints in the first place?
Mr. Maruyama: Joints are formed by the concave and convex articulation of two bones.
And the part where these two bones meet is covered by "articular cartilage", and the area around the joint is surrounded by "joint capsule".
Editorial Department: It is a complex structure, isn't it?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes, that's right.
There is tissue called synovium on the inside of the joint capsule, which produces synovial fluid.
This synovial fluid plays the role of a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
The reason why it is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for making the movement of the knees smooth is for that reason.
Editorial Department: What symptoms occur when you develop osteoarthritis?
Mr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage has viscosity and elasticity, and plays a role in preventing direct contact between bone and bone.
In other words, it plays a role like a cushion.
However, if this is worn down or distorted, it can cause joint deformation or inflammation, resulting in pain.
"Do you wear pajamas when you sleep?"

Real Sound presents 3 selections of gambling and games from the "Kaiji" series that you can actually experience - Yahoo! News.
The "Kaiji" series, a gambling manga that boasts explosive popularity, mainly among men.
One of the highlights of this work is a game that pushes the limits and risks one's life.
[Photo] Just by looking at it, my legs freeze... Challenging the iron beam crossing!
So this time, I want to verify Kaiji's games that can actually be played, or those that have been put into practice in planning videos.
"Swamp" - It's a pachinko full of traps that appeared in the manga/anime series "Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor".
In the original work, a high rate of 4000 yen per ball surprised Kaiji.
In this "swamp", there were large traps set up such as "nail forest", "movable obstacles", and "3-layered cranes", and it was considered almost impossible to conquer them.
However, using every trick in the book, Kaiji resorted to a risky move at the end - he placed a vinyl tank on the building's foundation, causing it to sink and tilt. He successfully conquered the challenge.
"The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appears as a pachinko machine, and many people are playing it."
Of course, there is no such thing as "one ball for 4000 yen," and the difficulty has been reduced, but you should be able to experience the feeling of being Kaiji.
The wealthy held a "Star Side Party" as a form of entertainment where they made debtors, including Kaiji, compete in a human horse race across a steel beam.
The debtor proceeds while devising a way not to fall from the thin steel frame installed 10 meters above ground, competing for speed.
12 people are participating, and only the top 2 can win the prize money. However, there are only 4 steel beams available, and the safety measures are insufficient, making the possibility of death quite high.
This steel beam crossing is highly dangerous, but it has been developed as a VR game, and you can also have an extremely close experience with the "Eagle Bridge" installed at the home of the professional baseball team, the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi".
At a height of 20 meters (equivalent to a 7-story building), there is a single iron bridge extending from this Eagle Bridge, and beyond that, the "Sky Swing" and the "One Victory Bridge" are prepared, and you walk towards them.
Of course, safety measures have been implemented.
Japanese comedian Koala Koran gained fame when he posted a video on his personal YouTube channel in which he walked on the Eagle Bridge and claimed that it's an experience of crossing steel structures that one can only have in Japan.
E-Card is a two-player card game.
Use one Emperor card, 8 Citizen cards, and one Slave card for a total of 10 cards, and play divided into the Emperor side and the Slave side.
This game is very well made and has the characteristic that the emperor is strong to the citizens, the citizens are strong to the slaves, and the slaves are strong to the emperor.
In the story, Kaiji faces Tonegawa under the harsh rule of "If you lose, your own ears will be cut off."
Even though he had a tough time, Kaiji realized that he was being psychologically read when he noticed a device, which was like an earphone, was attached to his ear and destroying it. The device sensed changes in his pulse and body temperature and transmitted the data. He shaved his own ears to the extreme and manipulated his body to abnormal levels, confusing Tonegawa and ultimately winning the game.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased on Amazon and other websites.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of himself playing cards with Tatsuya Fujiwara, who played the role of Kaiji in a movie, and it became a hot topic.
"Would you like to experience the feeling of being Kaiji?"
"Nobody wants to experience a situation like Kaiji's, but the fact is that even just reading the manga can give you a sense of what it feels like."
Why don't you try feeling the worldview through games?
One step towards the new year, gently pushing forward with a large tiger Ema at the Ken Gokoku Shrine | Yamagata Newspaper.
A large "Ema" (a wooden board with wishes written on it) depicting the zodiac animal for the next year, "Tiger," has been unveiled at the Kenkok Shrine in Yamagata City, where preparations for the new year are underway.
On the 11th day, Tohoku University of Art and Design students who designed it visited the same shrine, and a dedication ceremony was held in front of the shrine.
The same shrine has been commissioning original designs for ema (votive tablets) from students of Geiko university since the year before last.
This time, out of the artworks created by 9 students in the Japanese painting course taught by Professor Toshiaki Suenaga, the work of Yui Tsuchiya (22 years old), a third-year student, was adopted.
The big ema is 3.3 meters wide and has a height of approximately 1.8 meters at the center.
It is said that Mr. Tsuchiya painted an image of "sakura gently pushing the back that steps toward the new year".
The sight of a tiger stopping to gaze at cherry blossom flowers carries the wish to be able to appreciate the beauty of nature amidst the rapidly changing world.
Tsuchiya's designs are also depicted on ema that are generally distributed.
Gon Nenki Chiba Kenichi (44), a Shinto priest, said, "I think it will be a help for everyone to overcome difficult times."

"Let's think about how to continue living in Tamano" - Workshop for 4 high school students in the city to provide proposals: San'yō Shimbun Digital.
What kind of town will Tamano be in the year 2030?
Representative students from four high schools within Tamano city are working together to participate in a workshop to consider "Tamano that we want to continue living in".
As part of the research and policy proposal project of the mid-term support organization "Tamano SDGs Future Creation Center", we will gather the raw voices of young people and present them as proposals to the mayor and others.
"What makes you happy?"
In response to the facilitator's question, the students answered eagerly with things like "when I'm socializing and having fun with many people" and "when I'm playing the drums."
The first meeting was held at Hinode Fureai Kaikan on November 13th.
A group of 18 high school students and local residents discussed topics such as "interesting town," "livable town," and "town that provides a sense of purpose" while moving to different "islands" designated for each theme using the World Cafe method.
Write down your thoughts on sticky notes and organize them by pasting them onto a large sheet of paper.
"The town with many young people seems interesting. For livability, transportation like trains and buses are essential."
Let's see if we have any common ground and discuss further.
"Tamano high school student (18) said 'I thought Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle by the seaside is attractive.'"
The third-year students (18 years old) from Binnan High School said, "Although there are few shops and transportation is inconvenient, it's good to have a place rich in nature," and through discussions with adults, they seemed to recognize not only the issues but also the charm of the local area.
For the second meeting in December, only high school students gathered to organize the content of their proposals.
We plan to invite the mayor, superintendent of education, and others to make an announcement in February of next year.
The director of the same center, Rie Higashiri, says "If we can cultivate high school students' love for their hometowns and provide opportunities for young people to actively participate in town development, it would be great."

"How to find it: New ways to wrap a stole (Sankei Newspaper) - Yahoo! News"
It's a must-have in winter, but do you ever feel like the fabric of your scarf is too bulky around your neck?
After wrapping it, it is good to balance while looking at the mirror, but sometimes we hear voices saying that they don't know the trick.
I was thinking, "If only there was a stole that wouldn't be too bulky and could be wrapped up quickly.." then I found something new and innovative.
The brand "COTTORI (Kotori) " makes scarves with a compact size feeling, with the longest edge being approximately 1 meter, shorter than the usual ones.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Can it really be wound up so short?"
If you look closely, the fabric has been cut into long and narrow strips and knitted together to create one piece, resulting in a mesh-like texture overall.
The mesh has a space for the end of the scarf to pass through.
So, even without tying the ends together, it can be wrapped and secured.
Made of fleece material, it is very light and warm.
This year, sleeveless vests (also known as "vests") are popular even as outerwear, but many people combine them with a stole to keep their shoulders warm.
I think it will be convenient to have such a stole.

The Beatles documentary on Disney Plus is super interesting.
It's something that Peter Jackson directed called "Get Buck".
It feels fresh and realistic like life-sized Beatles in various ways.
We are experiencing some tension because it's right before the dissolution, but it's not the dramatic tension that I had imagined.
While managing tasks with diligence, there are pesky Pauls who say things like, "I know I'm annoying, but..." and Georges who whine, "But, you know..." There are also Johns who seem to lack motivation as they arrive late despite giving sensible opinions and jokes in a relatively calm manner. The peacekeeping apple doesn't interject much, sitting in the back making a troubled face and saying things like, "Oh dear..."
"Well, it's not like we hate each other enough to fight like that, but there's definitely a sense of 'well, it's probably not possible for us to work together anymore' kind of atmosphere, and it's interesting that The Beatles had the same kind of feeling. It's like dismantling a legend, or something like that."
And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance begins, everyone is truly overflowing with talent.
The process of creating "that masterpiece" while exchanging phrases like "how about this?" is awesome.
Especially the moment when the title track, "Get Buck," is completed is amazing.
The scene where a casual hum gradually turns into that "Zucha♪Zucha♪" with lyrics is firmly recorded and amazing.
"It's amazing to be able to see the process of composing music like this since it's not something that is often seen."
Well, it goes without saying, but since everyone is fully oiled up, just watching the performance scene makes me happy.
It seems that we are still in the first of three episodes, but the impression at the moment is that the biggest cause of dissolution was not the Beatles themselves, but the environment surrounding them.
The four of them, despite making complaints here and there, seemed to have fun once they started composing music.

"I think it's tough to keep on living just a little bit now, isn't it?"
I come from a sales position, but became mentally ill and changed jobs. Although I'm not good at initiating sales activities myself, I realized that I'm really suited for sales activities that are demanded by customers, so I chose a different industry and changed jobs. Since then, I have become much easier to work with.
I think that if you can find something you are even slightly good at or capable of in your own way, even if you are asked to do something you couldn't do, your future life will become a little easier.
Of course, I think it's good to consider this after taking a slow break and having some peace of mind.
I believe that in our daily lives, it would be helpful to consult the company union, industrial physician, or a counseling service, as they may have some kind of system available. It would be good to try consulting with them at least once to see if there are any systems in place.
It would be nice if we can live our lives with a bit more ease from now on.

"Tornado outbreaks cause great damage in America, affecting warm temperatures and strong cold air out of season (Weather News - Yahoo! News)".
On the night of the 10th (Friday) and into the 11th (Saturday) local time, multiple tornadoes occurred mainly in the southern region of the United States.
It is believed that the atmosphere became extremely unstable due to the strong cold air mass that moved southward into an area that was record warm for this time of year, and as a result, cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed.
Warm air flowed into the southern United States from the southwest, resulting in record high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, on the 9th ( Thursday) and 10th ( Friday) the local time, the highest temperature is rising up to nearly 30 ℃.
Due to a strong cold air mass dropping below -30℃ at around 5,500 meters high, amidst the record warmth, a vigorous front was formed due to a large temperature difference. As a result, cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed along the front.
It is believed that tornadoes have occurred one after another in the surrounding area.
The southern region of America is originally a susceptible area for tornado occurrence, but the high season usually falls from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases of extensive damages during this period.
During the winter season, the tornado warning was issued nearly 150 times in a single day, reaching a record-breaking number.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States received reports of over 400 tornadoes and gusts of wind on just the 10th (Friday) local time.
According to this, it is known that there are two distinct concentrated areas divided broadly by a south line from Kentucky to Texas and a north line including Illinois.
In the state of Kentucky, it is believed that the tornado reached an EF3 level on the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF Scale), which has 6 levels and corresponds to the third strongest level. Momentarily, gusts of wind of around 70m/s were blowing.
Depending on future investigations, there is also a possibility of classifying it as an EF4-5.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese version of the Improved Fujita Scale) is used, which is based on the Improved Fujita Scale but adapted to the situation of Japanese buildings.
JEF3, which is equivalent to the tornado in America this time, has a high possibility of occurring in Japan and can cause the collapse of wooden houses.

"Bizarre tornado "the biggest in history" cries for help live broadcasted even under the debris (Nikkansports) - Yahoo! News"
Regarding the tornado damage in the Midwestern and Southern United States, President Biden solemnly expressed his opinion on the 11th (12th Japan time), calling it "one of the largest tornadoes in US history."
Reported by American CNN television and others.
Mr. Biden emphasized that "we will do everything as the federal government."
"I explained that the full extent of the damage, such as the number of lives lost, is not yet known."
There is a fear that the number of dead may exceed 100.
[Photo] Residents carrying furniture and household goods from damaged houses in Kentucky, where more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least six states including Kentucky from the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th.
Regarding the range of damage caused by a tornado, there is a recorded range of 219 miles (approximately 350 kilometers) that caused damage in Missouri in 1925. However, according to a weather expert from American news network CNN, it is estimated that this recent tornado had a maximum range of approximately 250 miles (approximately 400 kilometers).
In Mayfield, Kentucky, which suffered significant damage, a candle factory that was operating around the clock to prepare for the Christmas shopping season was also heavily affected.
At that time, 110 people were working, but the building was destroyed and disappeared without a trace.
In the darkness, a woman became trapped under debris approximately 1.5 meters thick and unable to move. She felt the weight of rescuers searching on top of the debris and sought help through a live Facebook broadcast from her smartphone.
In the live broadcast that was made public, in addition to the screams of a woman calling for help, the sound of screams and another woman singing "Happy Birthday to You" while crying is believed to have been heard to distract from the fear.
Amber Brown, a convenience store employee living in Mayfield, hid with her 5-year-old son in the basement of their home due to a tornado warning and was unharmed.
"He looked back and said, 'Many people describe it as the sound of a train, but it was actually a terrifying sound that was more like an explosion.'"
The police officers of Mayfield City Police Department will continue the search operation until there is no longer a need for it.
"I don't know if it was several weeks, months, or years, but they continued their diligent rescue efforts."
In the state of Illinois, a warehouse of the internet shopping giant Amazon partially collapsed, and at least six deaths have been confirmed.
Trains have been derailing due to shocks so strong that the train cars become disconnected, and highways are being repeatedly closed due to overturned vehicles and other effects.
According to a US web media, about 400,000 houses, including 130,000 in Tennessee, are experiencing a power outage.

The idea that there are different interpretations of the star rating evaluation system has been around since ancient times.
The argument is that while other countries subtract points from a standard of five stars, Japan adds or subtracts points from a neutral standard of three stars.
"At the baseline, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars can have completely different meanings between 'there are deductions' and 'not a masterpiece, but a good work'."
If the rating system is based on a five-star scale, both "works with no flaws" and "works at the highest level in every aspect" would be listed in the same category. If such a tendency exists, then it would be considered a flaw in the rating system to not indicate the meaning behind the stars. However, since such a system is currently being used for such purposes, the request is to please not give a three-star rating (negative reviews).
Therefore, when trying to refute the arguments of those who assert such views using the two-choice evaluation of Steam, the conversation becomes disjointed.

Is there an underwater pump that can be powered by USB and can fit the size of a typical hose?
The capacity of the power that can be obtained from USB is roughly up to 2A with 5V, so the maximum is only 10W.
The power consumption of a submersible pump depends on the type, but at least it will consume around 500W, so it's impossible to use it in this case.

The Chapter About Making Your Own Radio
I made an AM radio with a homemade capacitor and coil, but there was a lot of noise and it wasn't clear to hear.
I was able to hear the sound of the radio, but I heard a different radio station from the one I tuned to.
There is a possibility that the tuning was not accurate and it may not have been heard well, but it was different from the intended station.
The actual point is that I made an AM radio here, but it seems like I can hear FM radio instead.
What do you think is the reason? Does such a thing really happen?

"Saga Food Diary: 'Hakobune's Tempura of Seasonal Fish and Shrimp Caught in Nearby Waters with Homemade Tartar Sauce' | Lifestyle・Culture | Saga Newspaper News | Saga Newspaper LIVE"
Bento box featuring seasonal fried fish and shrimp from the nearby sea, served with homemade tartar sauce.
"Hakobune" is a take-out specialty store for colorful bento boxes made abundantly with vegetables and deli dishes.
"With the intention of allowing people to experience a restaurant-like atmosphere even at home," Mr. Takayuki Katsuki (39) and Mrs. Yumi Katsuki (38) opened last year in August."
One of the popular lunch menu items is "Seasonal fried fish and shrimp caught in local waters with homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
Fish are chosen based on what is good at the time in the market.
"It's said that to understand the texture of the ingredients, the breadcrumbs used for frying are made to be as thin as possible," says Takayuki, "and the crunchy texture of the shrimp fry can be directly felt."
The bento comes with several side vegetables, about four kinds of deli, Hinohikari rice from Saga Prefecture with mixed grains, and soup.
We purchase vegetables from the nearby homemade fields and local direct sales outlets within the prefecture.
The side dishes may vary depending on the season, but Kikko-san has trained in French cuisine and adds color with dishes like ratatouille and ratatouille.
On the other hand, they blend Japanese and Western flavors to appeal to a wide range of generations, while also providing a familiar and comforting taste, such as in the case of dashimaki tamago (according to Yumi-san).
"Bento box "handmade hamburger with domestically produced ground beef" (1000 yen) is also popular."
Starting next year, a processed meat product set called "charcuterie set" that goes well with wine and other alcoholic beverages will also be released for sale.

I happened to come to Haneda Airport and saw something interesting, so I tried using it.
Ride comfort is not that bad, but occasionally it shakes (not enough to make someone feel sick).
Speed is naturally slow.
Safety - I think it's relatively safe because I slow down or even come to a complete stop if there are people around, but depending on the location, I thought it could be dangerous.
The gaze from the surroundings is painful. Being looked at is good, but it hurts my heart when I feel like they're looking at me as if I were a nuisance.
Overall, it's not bad, but there is still room for improvement.
It's unfortunate that it would be more user-friendly if there were fewer people or if they were considerate enough to move to the sides.
Specifically, I thought it would be good to create dedicated lanes and make sure they don't obstruct people who are walking.
However, because I'm leisurely, I thought it would be a better ride if there were a little less people because you can take your time while enjoying the scenery.
I wonder if this kind of autonomous driving will become mainstream in the future. It's a difficult mode of transportation that requires a fairly patient person to endure the excitement of the near-future feeling and the pleasantness of being the center of attention from those around you.
I was so embarrassed.

If you take a closer look, you might understand a little, but this is a fake eel rice bowl that doesn't contain any actual eel.
Actually, it's "eggplant!" (The answer will appear when you tap it.)
I like eel, but I thought that everyone basically just eats it with sauce and that the actual cooking of the eel didn't matter much. But then I realized that the texture and quantity of the eel are actually important.
"I don't want eels to become extinct, but I just wanted to eat eel."

"Long journey of a family who established environmental protection activities in the remote border areas of China." (JBpress - Yahoo! News)
(Kato Yuki: Hong Kong company Find Asia business consultant) China, with its vast land, is important in terms of biodiversity, with the world's largest variety of mammalian species and the third-largest variety of plant species.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and promote not only environmental protection carried out by the local government but also the activities of environmental activists in their region.
Yunnan Province's Xishuangbanna (Sipsongpanna) located in southwestern China is one of these regions.
My younger sister, Li Wanda, is currently working as an actress. The region of Sisophon is where Laos and Myanmar share their borders, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the Tai ethnic group, who share roots with the Thai people of Thailand.
The source of the Mekong River that flows through various Southeast Asian countries is flowing.
Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture: Although Xishuangbanna's territory accounts for just around 0.2% of China's total area, it is home to approximately 25% of all wild animal species and 20% of all plant species.
On this occasion, I had the opportunity to meet Rihwakwa Lee, who is engaged in environmental conservation activities in Sisapanma, and listen to her talk about the details of her activities on-site.
My husband, who is German, and I started environmental protection activities - we have been doing this for 20 years.
What was the trigger for that?
Mr. Li, our environmental protection activity "Tenmoku" has been active since 2000.
The reason for that is my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and he came to Chiang Saen for a joint UN and China science project.
This is the only tropical rainforest region in China and boasted high biodiversity.
However, on the other hand, there was a delay in economic development.
Therefore, in order to establish industries in this region and to produce rubber, which was in short supply within China, large-scale deforestation of tropical rainforests had previously been carried out.
My husband was dispatched from Germany here for the restoration of natural resources and research on biological resources.
And then, I met and married a journalist here.
"Before that, did Mr. Li not have any interest in nature conservation?"
Li-san, I am from Sisavang, but I was not interested in the significance of tropical rainforests or biodiversity.
As a result, I ended up promoting the project with my husband without any knowledge of it.

[Personal Memo / Reminder] It caused a CTD (crash to desktop) in my MOD environment and it took about a month and a half to identify the cause.
"Until March, we had stable data, but since around Golden Week, we haven't been able to play much and we have experienced CTD caused by multiple factors. It has been very difficult to identify the root cause as we have only been able to investigate during holidays."
"Why didn't you analyze the logs with .Net Script Framework? (You would understand in a few minutes)"? Well, some of the errors related to .dll series or mesh issues don't show up in the crash logs.
Main timings of CTD
"All .dll plug-ins of the type that leave logs such as Papyrus or .Net Script Framework do not leave any trace in the logs."
If the accumulation of NPC killings/attacks occurs, it may activate even with the console command "kill." In order to improve this issue, turn off the Essentials be Gone plugin (SKSE plugin/powerofthreeSE updated version). However, there is a possibility that this issue may be a misunderstanding.
During camera work for activating kill moves against some NPCs, the basic improvement is to turn off kill move settings by PC through the .ini file. There may be conflicts in the settings between DAR and Nemesis, but the limit has not reached even up to 10,000 DAR animations.
(Basic outdoor) While moving in the field and activating some magic (e.g. freezing runes), if NPC is hit: after 5 consecutive trials with all settings for Dirt & Blood v 2.0's SPID application for NPCs turned OFF (upper right of MCM), all issues will be resolved.
Is it caused by a shader setting error for additional armor and body meshes worn by some actors/NPCs? Also, although there is a formatting error in the default .ini file for SPID usage in 2.0, it should result in the intended effect of applying prerequisite Perks to NPC.
At first, we focused on checking for false accusations in motion/combat MODs related to part attacks or OnHit (.dll), but we ended up with results like this.
I think there were no similar bug reports at least at the level of English, German, and French.
If there happens to be anyone who is experiencing a similar CTD problem in a Japanese language environment, I thought it might be helpful to post this as a reference for future use.
Most people are doing it with their mental state just barely holding up.
No one around notices it, not even colleagues let alone family.
Sometimes I look around and think optimistically, "That person seems to be struggling but they're doing their job with great energy."
However, he probably also has a mental state that is on the edge.
I did not quit my job under the pretext of mental health, but I think I was at my limit just before quitting.
Thoughts on the Importance of Psychiatric Home Visit Nursing - After Today's Visit.
I have been receiving home nursing care for a long time due to my bipolar disorder, and I have built a very good relationship with the nurse (a female) from the home nursing station that I am currently using, as we have been acquainted for a long time.
Every week, we have various conversations.
Of course, they take care of things essential to medication management such as unit dosing, but above all, during today's home visit nursing, I deeply realized how important enjoyable communication is for people with mental illnesses.
Today, we ended up discussing gender theory and such, or rather, chatting about the differences between men and women.
We also have conversations about topics like sexual desires of men and women, or reasons why someone's girlfriend got divorced - some people wonder if it's appropriate to discuss those things during home nursing visits.
Sometimes, but not often, I crossdress.
However, I have heard from an acquaintance that in the case of the visiting nursing station operated by a psychiatric hospital, there may be older female nurses who can no longer work on the wards and only provide administrative support. Additionally, there have been instances where occupational therapists visiting for nursing care are given orders in a condescending tone, such as "We are providing medical care here."
The small home healthcare station that I am using is run by a social welfare corporation, but I think the nurses there are really good because they treat me, someone with a mental illness, as an equal and face me openly.
By the way, (she) is beautiful, haha.
There may be people who are receiving psychiatric home care nursing, and there may be people who are considering receiving it.
Home nursing is very beneficial for people with mental disorders.
If the doctor approves, please definitely go for it.
And, let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
Previously, there were some cases where I just couldn't get along with them and I had to terminate the contract myself.
I'm sorry for the poor writing.
"I know it's a false alarm, but I got scared when it appeared in English."
Why is it coming out in English?

Issue with language detection.
The browser settings are prioritized in English.
The ranking of the least frequent appearance in the lottery number for Loto 6 is all odd numbers.

South Korea's hydrogen technology patents only 1/5 of China's... "Delay in fulfilling hydrogen economy roadmap" (Chuo Nippo Japanese version) - Yahoo! News.
The South Korean government announced a hydrogen economy roadmap in 2019.
The content was to popularize (cumulative) 65,000 fuel cell vehicles by 2022, and operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6,000 won (approximately 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, fuel cell vehicles are only at 27% of the target (around 17,000 units) as of November this year.
The goal for the widespread schedule of hydrogen stations for core infrastructure is 38% (approximately 117 locations) and the price of hydrogen per kilometer is around 8400 won, which is not significantly different from the time the roadmap was announced.
It was found that the Japanese government's fulfillment status of the hydrogen economy roadmap is significantly below target values.
The Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) released a report titled "Current Status and Policy Direction of the Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem" on the 12th.
According to the report, the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mainly dependent on countries such as the United States and Japan.
The core materials for fuel cell vehicles such as carbon fibers are supplied by Toray (Japan), platinum catalysts by Kyocera (Japan), membrane films by DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), 3M (USA), and others.
The number of hydrogen technology patents among the six leading countries in the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has been increasing at an average annual rate of 14% since 2014.
In the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells, Korea is ranked fifth in the world for the number of patents filed (cumulatively from 2014 to 2020).
However, the Japan Business Federation (全経連) conveyed that "in fact, six countries occupy the majority of the global hydrogen market, and it means that Japan ranks low among the competing countries."
The ranking of patent applications by country is as follows: China, United States, European Union, Japan.
Since 2017, China has surpassed the United States and has been widening the gap between the two as the number one.
The number of patents registered in 2020 ranked South Korea in 4th place with 1,033 patents, surpassing Japan's 974 patents, but this is only at 22% level compared to China's 4,721 patents.
Zenkeiren proposed that "hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'national strategic technology' with a large tax deduction for facility investment and research and development costs."
I had surgery to cut the muscles in my finger and it has been a month and a half since then.

It will heal naturally, but it takes a considerable amount of time.
Even if it hurts, if you don't do rehabilitation, you won't be able to move, so let's do rehabilitation, shall we?

Were there fewer elder sister-type wives during the Meiji to Showa eras compared to now?
I think there were many elder sisters who became wives.
It's because the term "ane-san nyobo" has become popularly used these days.
And, in the old days, it was said to even search for a wife who is one year older than oneself, even if it meant wearing golden straw sandals. So I think that in the Meiji and Showa periods, there were more wives older than their husbands than there are now.

Is it a crime for a store to sell items higher than the suggested retail price?
Today, the PS5 was sold on store shelves for 70,000 yen.
It is legal.
Since it is a free competition, for example, if the value of a brand item becomes rare and increases from the original price.
For example, it is considered legal for the price of a painting to rise as a painter becomes famous.
The fact that Ps5 is being sold at a high price is only due to its rarity value, and its value has increased above the regular price.

"Parliament on Sunday?" (This sentence is not complete and may require more context to fully understand its meaning.)
Creating leaflets in the style of a TV program, parliamentary reform is underway in Takasu, and a "report card" for members of parliament is also being prepared: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin Digital Edition.
In Takasu, the town council is working on unique parliamentary reforms, such as creating unusual flyers to announce regular meetings and introducing a "report card" system for citizens to evaluate their members of parliament.
The aim of the town council election is to get the town's residents interested, as it has been uncontested for three consecutive terms.
On the 9th, we distributed approximately 1,800 new flyers through newspaper inserts to notify people about the Sunday council meeting scheduled for the 12th.
"Starting from the morning with fresh raw fish, Tetsuko's room, and Sawaguchi Jin's exploration series..."
The flyer distributed to all households by the town council on the 9th features wording that conjures up the names of popular television programs.

"US aid weapon ammunition arrives in Ukraine, also engaged in troop training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News."
(CNN) Officials from the US State Department reported on the 12th that equipment, including small arms and ammunition, based on the security assistance plan approved by President Biden has arrived in Ukraine.
Military aid totaling $60 million (approximately 6.8 billion yen) will be transported to Ukraine, including four radars that can identify launch points for mortars and other equipment, by the beginning of next year.
According to Kirby, the spokesperson for the US Department of Defense, these aids include lethal weapons such as anti-tank missiles "Javelin".
Military assistance aims to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities in response to Russian military reinforcement near the Ukrainian border.
The United States is increasing its vigilance against Russian military movements, and is consulting with NATO member countries to formulate a response plan in case Russia invades Ukraine.
President Biden had approved military assistance when President Zelensky of Ukraine visited the White House on September 1st this year.
US military aid to Ukraine reached approximately $450 million this year.
Since Russia forcibly annexed the Ukrainian Crimea peninsula, the total amount of aid has exceeded 2.5 billion dollars.
The US military is also engaged in training tasks for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, according to the joint training plan for Ukraine assistance, the National Guard of Florida in the United States was dispatched.
According to the statement by the US Department of Defense, the US Special Operations Forces in Europe are playing a significant role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US special forces operating within Ukraine has not been revealed as a matter of operational confidentiality.
On the 7th of this month, President Biden had an online meeting with Russian President Putin, but there were also tense exchanges regarding the situation in Ukraine.
The United States is also ready to impose severe economic sanctions if an invasion occurs.

The fate of the "review" of inheritance and gift taxes that restricts pre-death gifts, as well as an interview with Akira Amari, former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's taxation committee.
The first feature of the December 18th issue of "Weekly Diamond" is "Talking with Family during the Year-end and New Year Holidays!"
It is "Pre-death gift and last-minute inheritance techniques" in English.
As the debate over the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax advances, although it was a concern, it was postponed in the tax reform outline for fiscal year 2022. However, in the near future, there is a high possibility that the conventional method for inheritance tax countermeasures, which is gifting during one's lifetime, could become a forbidden move.
What are the rules for inheritance and how will they change?
We will teach you everything from the basics of giving and inheriting gifts for the discounted last-minute rush in time for the end of the year, to tax-saving techniques, along with a direct hit on Liberal Democratic Party's former tax committee chairman and Member of the House of Representatives, Akira Amari.
(Diamond Editorial Department, Keiaki Miyahara)
"Prohibiting the use of lifetime gifts, from wealthy individuals to urban corporate employees, towards the tax system's neutral design for the timing of asset transfer in regards to a more integrated approach to inheritance and gift taxes. We will carry out thorough examinations towards the establishment of a neutral tax system."
A sentence in the tax reform guidelines for the fiscal year 2021 announced by the ruling party last year caused significant anxiety not only among wealthy people but also among the middle class.
Because the intended purpose is to completely change the rules of inheritance, and to prohibit the "pre-gift" which is the mainstream inheritance tax measure, in order to greatly increase inheritance tax.
The golden rule of tax-saving measures for high progressive inheritance taxes is to "reduce the taxable property."
The strongest trump card of giving gifts while alive has been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by company employees who own homes in the three major metropolitan areas, where even a small amount of inheritance tax is generated.
The discussion of "integration of inheritance tax and gift tax", which came out of nowhere.
Although there were concerns about the fastest introduction, the tax reform outline for fiscal year 2022 announced on December 10, was set aside. However, the policy towards integration was reaffirmed with more detailed language such as "reviewing the current inheritance tax system and annual gifting system", and "the tax-free measures for gifting tax do not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within family members within the limit and will be reviewed continuously".
According to an interview with the editorial department, former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Tax Research Committee and former secretary general, Akira Amari, said.
"The most important thing is to eliminate advantages and disadvantages based on the timing of property transfer and to have the same tax burden regardless of when it is done."
"Currently, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise through integration. If it's the quickest revision, there are three opportunities left for lifetime gifts."
Even if [the situation] is not [the case] already, it seems highly likely that a significant move will soon be made towards invalidating pre-death gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So, what specific changes will occur in the rules for inheritance tax and gift tax?

"Haru, the protagonist, is played by Yukawa and Rise, the heroine, is played by Yamatani Hanajun."
Rie, a college student, meets her senior colleague, Kairi, at her part-time job.
Haru, who suffers from insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who, for some reason, can sleep soundly when leaning on Rie's shoulders.
Rise becomes attracted to Kairi, who resembles her estranged brother, but she begins to wonder if he is a killer due to certain circumstances.
Yudai Furukawa's drama "My Proper Big Brother" will be broadcasted on terrestrial television from January 10th!
For those who couldn't watch it on FOD, please look forward to it, and for those who have already watched it, I think you can understand the complexity of Hairy and Rise's psychological portrayal, their conflicts, and the changes they go through by knowing the plot. You can know this work more deeply by watching these aspects.
I would be happy if even fans of the original work could enjoy it.
Please look forward to it!

[ NFL ]: Team that won with only three passes in a game - What did the players feel and think? (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
In this game, Jones threw a pass for the Patriots only three times.
This was the lowest number since the Buffalo Bills recorded only two passes in their game against the New York Jets in Week 3 of the NFL in 1974, over the past 50 years.
In the 1974 Bills, there was a once-in-a-lifetime talented RB named O.J. Simpson who exceeded 2000 yards in a season, a historic first in the previous season.
Bills overwhelmed the Jets with the runs of Simpson and another RB, Jim Braxton.
"The biggest reason the Patriots played such an extreme offense this time around was the weather."
Buffalo is a town close to the border with Canada, and its latitude is similar to Kushiro in Hokkaido.
And on this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, and there was a strong wind with a speed of 18 meters per second, and it was snowing heavily before the game.
Bills didn't change the play selection much, probably because they were local.
"Out of 30 passes, there were 25 runs."
Allen's pass was 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no interception, and it was certainly not incompetent.
In 10 offensive series, there were 4 red zone penetrations and scoring opportunities.
Especially in the latter part of the third quarter, we advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, in those three attempts, we were only able to score three points in FG.
Defending in front of the goal during the final stages of the game.
The Bills, who were trailing by 4 points, committed a penalty on 3rd and 9, resulting in 3rd and 14.
The goal is 18 yards away.
"On 3rd and 14, QB Allen was surrounded by the Patriots defense rush, so he stepped out of the pocket and flowed to the right."
And he threw a pass aiming for TE Dawson Knox in the end zone, but it failed.
In this play, the ace WR Stefon Diggs who was positioned on the right outside had run a shallow cross route and had become free in front of the end zone, but it seemed that it did not catch Allen's attention.
On 4th & 18, Allen aimed for WR Gabriel Davis who ran into the end zone from the outside left, but the pass was knocked down by Patriots DB Miles Bryant in front of him and failed.
Bryant was covering Bills' WR Cole Beasley man-to-man, but he let him go after seeing Allen's movement and reacted to the pass instead.
Allen, who overlooked two receivers, threw a pass twice aiming for the end zone.
The pass on 4th down may have been predetermined, but there was no need to aim for a TD on 3rd down.
You just need to take a first down in two plays.
"It was only two minutes before, so if they had gone for 4th & short, Allen's ability to run would have made a difference."

It's almost time to "throw away" and "replace" 3 items that tend to be left in the kitchen for long periods of time, according to Harper's BAZAAR, as reported on Yahoo! News.
Sponge.
No matter how frequently it is changed, it is likely that sponges are not replaced as often as recommended.
From research conducted in 2017, it has been shown that even if a kitchen sponge is sterilized every day in the microwave, it can still harbor a large amount of bacteria (however, sterilizing it in the microwave is still recommended).
The German researcher who conducted this study recommends changing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
Cutting board.
The US Department of Agriculture recommends replacing cutting boards once they begin to wear down and develop scratches or grooves.
Once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean and bacteria multiply.
If it's still okay, don't forget to frequently disinfect with a solution made by dissolving one tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach in one gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in liquid and leave it for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water, then air dry or lightly tap with a clean paper towel to remove water and dry.
Chipped or cracked tableware.
It may be painful to dispose of your favorite mug, but the chipped surface could become a new breeding ground for bacteria and germs.
Also, it can be a cause of cut lips or spilled drinks in the missing parts.
Yes, this is a chance to buy a new favorite mug!

Yu Jin: "Yes sir!"
"I heard that even if 30,000 arrows rain down on him, Yu Jin won't die."
"Yo" or "Hey" (casual greeting in Japanese)
"I heard that they say they wouldn't die even if run over by a tiger tank."
"Uss" (Note: "Uss" is a slang greeting used in the Japanese military and among young people.)
"I won't die even if I'm swallowed by the turbid flow of the Han River."
"Ouss" or "Yo" (a casual greeting in Japanese)

Community markets and trading are two different things.
"In the community market, we use the Steam payment system."
This function allows you to engage in cash transactions with complete strangers, and there have been cases where people have been victims of fraudulent schemes where they are only left with the item without receiving any payment.
This means that it will not happen.
Trading is a function that allows you to exchange items or give them as gifts, and there is no buying and selling function.

Help me, FlashBIOS won't finish.
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X, so I replaced the B550 and Tomahawk that I bought in September.
I went all the way to the BIOS setup screen once, but after saving the settings and restarting, the screen turned black with a white cursor-like dot and it has been stuck in a state where it won't start blinking.
"I tried using FlashBIOS to rewrite it, thinking that the BIOS might be damaged, but it's taking forever to complete."
According to MSI's blog, it seems to finish in about 5 minutes, but it doesn't finish even after 1 hour.
Possible causes are either that the tested USB memory is too old or that the one using an SD card converter is causing the issue.
Did I leave my Tomaho (handheld console) idle for too long and now it's broken?
Is there any other possible cause that seems likely?
Do you dislike men who always have a serious expression?
Oh! There was someone I know.

For some reason, I feel ashamed of owning brand-name products.
I can carry things that don't stand out, but I cannot carry things with bold monograms like those of Louis Vuitton with Lv written on them.
Why is that, I wonder?
I think it's best to match something to your own size.
By the way, I think it would be good in Japan.
If it's Japan, then it is .
"Doesn't matter if it's foreigner style (Gaijin-fuu) or not."
It's better to say it early, "Why are you calling me by my first name or using casual language?"
If someone asks you if it doesn't matter because you're a foreigner, it's better to simply say that you find it unpleasant.
I don't think anyone dreams of being uncomfortable with a reasonable probability.
I was living abroad for a while, but among the Japanese people who went outside, including myself, there were a fair number of people who were uncomfortable with the traditional Confucian customs of hierarchy. Some of us got carried away and mistakenly thought that we could say anything we wanted to the locals.
I think if they appear to be Westerners, they are doing so with a friendly gesture or a kind of dependence, rather than pure malice.
Even if they're my friends, if they're from Western countries, I usually call them by their first names, but sometimes I'm a little hesitant about whether to do so when speaking in Japanese.
Well, it's still okay if it's a friend.
Originally, it might just be that they are doing things in a pure and normal way, but if we turn a blind eye to the exceptional treatment they receive simply because they are foreigners, it could become uncontrollable. That's why it's better to say it now.
"I was wondering if you could speak using Japanese rules since we are in Japan."
Edit: "This isn't related, but my White friend who naturalized always raises their glass higher than younger people when making a toast at drinking parties."  Translation: "Editing: This is unrelated, but my White friend who has naturalized always raises their glass higher than younger people when making a toast at drinking parties."
"I am definitely aware of it, but I think it's a good habit to behave that way because it prevents me from being underestimated or treated like a Japanese person by both younger and older people."
Regardless of one's personality, there are people in Japan, including myself, who pay attention to the finer details, so it can be a pain.

Thank you to the 50 subscribers!
I opened Reddit today and found out that this newly created subreddit has surpassed 50 subscribers.
I'm so happy.
Thank you to everyone who has subscribed!
Actually, as of yesterday, the number of subscribers was only 25, so I thought it would take a little longer to reach 50, but for some reason, 25 people subscribed just today, so I'm extremely grateful.
If you subscribed to this subreddit today, please let us know in the comments where you learned about it. We would really appreciate it! (I don't have any clue, so I'm really curious.)
Currently, I am the only one who is creating threads, so it would be appreciated if everyone else could create threads as well.
It would be encouraging if you could leave comments and such even if you don't make a thread.
I wonder if there are fewer people who use Twitter than those who use Reddit.
"If you are using Twitter, please also consider making a forum thread!"
Finally, thank you very much! The last time I made a subreddit, people didn't gather as I had hoped and I quickly gave up, but this time, thanks to all of you, it seems like I can keep going without giving up.
We will continue to work hard to maintain the wiki and rules, and make the subreddit easy to use. Thank you for your continued support!

"I only have a basic ability to understand English, so I will rely solely on the translated text to make judgments."
"I feel a little awkwardness in the translated text, but I think the message can be understood and it doesn't affect the gameplay level. However, this is just how I feel, so it might be good to ask others as well."
I often see this level of translation in games produced overseas, and if it's a small company, I feel like it's well translated.
I think that for non-native Japanese speakers to understand the subtle nuances of Japanese language, it may take a long period of time studying and practicing to reach that level of comprehension.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you're looking for a level that Japanese people don't feel uneasy about, it's probably best to look for someone else.

Analysis: "Demon Slayer" - Training is the Battle.
"'Equal exchange for effort' is a hymn to humanity" <Anime "Yukakuhen" starting commemoration> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News.
Among recent boys' manga, what is particularly unusual about "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba" is that there are "a lot of training sessions."
In general, it has become an established theory that training arcs where there is no battle, regardless of whether it's day or night, are not popular with readers.
In the same Jump manga "ONE PIECE", the Straw Hat crew were separated for 2 years of training, but it can be inferred from the fact that only touches were drawn and the rest was skipped extravagantly.
Well, one of the charms of One Piece is its eccentricity in traversing various lands, so staying in the same place for training doesn't always have a good compatibility with it.
Now, it can be said that the training of the protagonist, Tanjiro Kamado, in "Demon Slayer" began when he prostrated himself before Giyu Tomioka, who had saved his life, and begged for the life of his sister, Nezuko, who had tried to take his life. Tomioka exclaimed, "Do not let others hold the power of life and death over you!"
The weak have neither rights nor options, they are all forced to submit to the strong by force.
While saying that, it was the kindness of Giyuu who introduced Sakonji Urokodaki, the "trainer" who trains the hopefuls of the Demon Slayer Corps, without explaining his intention (he is also bad at communicating and doesn't explain things well).
The first contact between Tanjiro and Rengoku was when Rengoku asked, "What would you do if your sister ate a human?" Tanjiro was at a loss for an answer, and in response, Rengoku slapped him and remarked, "You're slow to make decisions."
A seemingly unreasonable exchange that has become a topic of conversation even among fans.
However, walking with a younger sister who has become a demon contains the possibility of being forced to make such judgments at some moment.
It could be said that entering into the training from the mindset is like an initiation.
However, the inexperienced and untrained Tanjirou is taken to Mt. Sagiri by Rui, who orders him to come down to the bottom of the mountain by dawn.
Mountains are full of traps, including pitfalls, catapults, and traps, on top of having thin air, making it seem like one is likely to die before starting the training.
Nevertheless, with their innate sharp sense of smell, they manage to barely avoid traps made by human hands by detecting the faint scent of them, which has become a kind of "protagonist's privilege".
Still, the essence of Demon Slayer is evident in the statement "But just because of that, it's not like our physical abilities suddenly increase to the point where we can avoid everything!!" made by Tanjiro, which implies that even with training, one cannot completely avoid everything, showcasing the true nature of Demon Slayer.
Ordinary humans do not suddenly become stronger without any basis, and awakening only allows them to use the power and skills that they have polished up until then to their original potential.
The "equivalent exchange of effort" states that those who make an effort will receive rewards in proportion to their effort, while those who do not make an effort will receive nothing. This principle is not based on supernatural powers like those possessed by demons, but is a human song of praise for consistency and an unwavering rule that is present throughout this work.
Translation: Is this old?
It is a way of sleeping where you lay a futon mattress directly on the floor of your house and sleep with a futon bedding set as opposed to sleeping on a bed.
It's because the house is not a condominium.
"I do that too."
If you want to use the room more spaciously, it's better to sleep on a futon than a bed.
I think there are a lot of people like that.
"Are you greedy?"
I am working as a part-timer, but is it greedy for someone to work at other stores and desire to work full-time?
No, I don't particularly think so.
In that case, it does not correspond to what I think of as "greedy".
I consider attempting to gain profits beyond the invested efforts with minimal labor as "greedy".

South Korean company Samsung Electronics establishes a new "DX department" that integrates home appliances and mobile, emphasizing user experience. (Wow! Korea) - Yahoo! News.
Following the integration of its CE and IM divisions as a set division, Samsung Electronics announced on the 12th that it has decided to name it DX (Device eXperience) and will reflect this in the year-end organizational restructuring.
The intention of enhancing user experience through a variety of services ranging from mobile to home appliances can be inferred from the text.
Samsung Electronics revealed that its newly established DX division, which combines CE and IM departments, consists of business units such as VD (Visual Display), home appliances, medical equipment, MX (Mobile eXperience), and network.
An official from Samsung Electronics explained that the name change this time reflects their medium- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and efforts to strengthen global leadership.
In addition, it emphasized the intention to enable consumers to easily enjoy an optimized experience through services and solutions that reflect the needs of customers, not to mention products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication equipment.
The strategy of creating synergy effects on a company-wide scale by crossing organizational boundaries and building a foundation for differentiated products and services was reflected in the name, taking advantage of the establishment of an integrated leadership structure.
Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy to enable users to freely access content and services through the interconnection of devices such as home appliances or smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) via the "Multi Device Experience (MDE) Consortium".

This place is a bit unnatural.
The larvae of the mantis waits in ambush in the sand at all times to catch its prey, exposing only its disc-shaped head from the sand.
I think it should be.
The concern is
Did you refer to other documentaries?
Are you looking at it from an ant's perspective?
"Is that so?"
If we translate "armoured heads" as "disc-shaped heads," I think the part that says "it is a giant beast wearing a helmet on an ant's scale" would disappear.
Aichi: 24 vehicles collide, trailer driver has no illnesses, was it due to negligence? (TV Asahi Network (ANN)) - Yahoo! News.
It has been revealed that the driver of the trailer, who was arrested and sent to prosecutors for causing an accident in which 24 cars collided in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, did not have any pre-existing medical conditions and is believed to have caused the accident due to some kind of carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles including trucks and passenger cars collided on National Route 41 in Komaki City, and 12 people suffered minor injuries.
The police arrested and sent 54-year-old suspect Masaya Nomura, who was driving a trailer and suspected of causing a rear-end collision that injured a 71-year-old man, on the morning of the 12th.
The trailer of suspect Nomura continued to move without braking even after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that Nomura temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, it has been determined that there were no pre-existing medical conditions with Mr. Nomura, and instead, it appears that some form of negligence was the cause.
The police are conducting a thorough investigation by searching the homes of relevant parties and examining the situation at that time.

Review of Kiniku Man by Ogino X [Volume 4 Edition] (Weekly Playboy News) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which began in Volume 3, concludes in this Volume 4!
In contrast to the previous volume that depicted everything from the opening to the semifinals in one go, this volume focuses on only one game and is filled with new ideas and approaches!
●"Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Review by Reviewer Oginuma X ★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ●The world of superhero wrestling begins even before the match starts!
To put it simply, this 4th volume carefully depicts the final match between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but it's important to note that it's not just about the match in the ring.
Starting from the signing ceremony, there are battles of restraint between each other and training scenes, quite different from before, but it is never boring despite the fact that the match doesn't begin easily.
The feeling in the story that the tension is gradually mounting as the highly anticipated battle of the century is about to begin is definitely contributing to the readers' excitement, and I am thoroughly impressed that even this period was orchestrated with calculated precision.
And, before the important finals, another must-see event is the 3rd place match between Teriyaman and Ramenman.
Not only the splendor of the match, but what I like is Ramenman pointing at Kin-kinman's poster backstage before the match saying, "Now I am the target!"
And try to strike with a chop.
However, Terrierman who happened to pass by at that time intercepted the blow with one hand, and silently stared down the attacker, ending the scene with just that.
"What's amazing about this is that both of them have already been eliminated, so there is no chance for either of them to fight against Kinikuman within this tournament."
But there are people who are troubled and worried about that Kinnikuman issue.
When I see something like this, I cannot help but think about my future achievements.
"This is a moment that reminds me, as a manga artist, what it means for a character to stand out!"
The fight between those two was not very long, but the memorable scene was Ramenman's tearful plea after the match.
"Please do not rely only on extraordinary luck for your strength in Kinnikuman!"
It's a line of dialogue.
This is more like a grand meta-statement about the work itself. Up until now, I think the readers have had a vague sense that Kinikuman always wins because he's the protagonist, and that he's somehow managing to win through means other than his actual strength.
However, by having Ramen Man make this statement, Professor Boiled Egg has nailed it himself that he can no longer use that method anymore.
With this word, the reader thinks, "Wait, so does that mean Kiniku Man will actually defeat Robin with his strength?"
"How do I do it?"
You'll be stirred up with more imagination towards the unfolding story that we can't see the end of, and looking at it from the perspective of the author, this is a dialogue that seems like Mr. Yudetamago, who creates works, has imposed restrictions on himself.
"This is impressive."
I definitely think this is one of the major points of this volume.

Shin Kazuhara, a renowned trumpet player who performed on the first-ever opening theme song for the TV program Friday Roadshow called "Friday Night Fantasy," has passed away.
I was 74 years old.
I was in charge of performing the music for "Lupin the Third" series and "Castle in the Sky" - "The Boy and the Dove".
I respectfully offer my prayers for your peaceful rest.
I am thinking of going to a nail salon for my coming-of-age ceremony.
However, the round and small shape of my nails makes me feel self-conscious about going out.
Is there anyone who understands my feelings? (>_<)
Is this your first time at a nail salon?

If you don't have any hobbies, life wouldn't be enjoyable, right?
It's enjoyable to have something you're passionate about or something you want to do with dedication, not limited to just hobbies, whether it's in work or anything else.
Winter Illumination to be held on weekends at Aobayama in Takahama Town, Fukui Prefecture (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News.
At the Aobayama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama, the first winter illumination has started, and the park is wrapped in soft light.
(December 12th) The winter illumination, which started on November 26th, includes 50,000 LED bulbs scattered around the walking paths, lawns, and a 20-meter tall tree.
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture said, "It's been a while since we came to Fukui, and we were surprised to find such a place."
"She was saying that it was really beautiful and it made her feel relieved."
The illumination was first planned to provide a healing experience while avoiding crowdedness, and it is lit from 5pm to 8:30pm on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25th.
Also, on the final day of the 25th, a Christmas event is scheduled to be held, where button hot pot will be served and a movie screening will also take place.
I think there are limited people who can read and comprehend documents in order.
I have a friend who is a really good reader and can read quickly. I asked him about it and he explained that he had built up his skills by starting with the basics of Linux and working his way up through practice, rather than just reading documentation. He typically reads reference books by browsing through the table of contents and selecting topics that interest him.
In reality, it is more applicable and easier to understand to learn from Linux or something before touching high abstraction level technologies like Docker suddenly.
"It's quite tough to suddenly understand everything without skipping any part."
If you understand, that would be great but...
"You don't have to do it in order."
"The main point is not to remember everything, but just vaguely remember the parts that were skipped while reading beforehand, so that they can be read when necessary."
"I gradually started reading as I repeatedly practiced without reading anything and breaking things suddenly."
The child has developed a rash on their body.
Day by day, it is getting bigger in size.
Is this a case where eczema has developed due to dryness?
It's better to see a dermatologist as soon as possible.
"The clinic will be closed during the New Year's holidays, so it is better to take quick action for your child."

Net broadcasting, promotion of agricultural and livestock products: Okitama Agricultural Promotion Association broadcasts from Yonezawa | Yamagata Newspaper.
The Okitama Agricultural Promotion Council, which includes cities and towns in the Okitama region and JA, conducted a PR campaign for agricultural and livestock products using "live commerce," which sells products while streaming videos on the internet, on the 11th.
The "National Collaboration MINATO (Port) Market TV" planned for the first time by the Minato Ward of Tokyo was remotely attended by Yamanashi Ai no Busho-tai and they delivered the attractiveness of the region along with local specialties.
Through the collaborative initiative between Okitama region and Minato ward, the "Okitama x Minato Port Opening Project", an opportunity for business has been decided and relayed from the Satoyama Vision House in Minamihara Shincho, Yonezawa City.
Mika Kuroda, who is active as a "Satoyama sommelier", introduces the charm of the region surrounded by nature, wearing a stole from the Yonezawa weave brand "nitorito".
We also shared the atmosphere of the sweet potato party with the Military Commanders of Love.
At the Tokyo studio, comedians Tanpopo's Emiko Kawamura and YouTubers with over 300,000 subscribers tasted local sake, wine, Miyagi beef, and Tsuyahime rice from Okitama.
When conveying the deliciousness to the viewers, comments praising the experience such as "Even though it's a broadcast, I can smell the aroma" and "So many delicious things to enjoy with alcohol, it's the best" were flying around.

I am thinking of planting some bellflowers in the garden.
Is the balloon flower resistant to summer heat?
If so, when the flowers finish in spring, let's cut the stem leaving 10-15cm.
Branches grow from the base of the leaves, so please look forward to it.
Happy New Year!
I just got home from visiting a shrine or temple for the first time this year with my girlfriend.
Her smile is beautiful even in the new year.
Question.

Please tell me.
Happy New Year!
"Lovely dovey is good, isn't it? ＼(^o^)／"
This morning, unfortunately...
"My NAS PC's power won't come on anymore 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉"
"What happened?"
1.) Open the window for ventilation in the morning.
At this time, the PC is powered on.
2.) After returning to the room after a little while, I noticed a sound like a pink rotor coming from my PC, and I shut it down for the time being.
At this point, it was thought that the movement of the fan had only deteriorated due to a decrease in room temperature (by 6 degrees Celsius).
So, I decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) Not starting up.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp lights up and the fan also moves for a moment, but immediately stops.
After that, there was complete silence and no one said anything.
Try unplugging the power plug and give it another try, but it still turns on only for a moment.
4.) Tried connecting only the motherboard and ATX20-pin, 4-pin and removed other parts to test, but it did not boot.
5.) I have been suspecting that the PSU might be the cause of the buzzing sound that sometimes occurs because it seems like the fan of the PSU is hitting something.
I will find an extra ATX power supply and try it out at a later date.
Probably.
I wonder what to do if it doesn't work out.
"Should I replace the case and the motherboard together?"
Have you recently (within the past 4-5 years or so) seen a wild rabbit?
Where did you see it?
"Are you surrounded by nature?"
I live in Tohoku region.
They can be found anywhere near my house.
They are also in the garden or the company's parking lot.
"2021 Emoji Ranking of Frequently Used Ones (Gizmodo Japan) - Yahoo! News"
"My most frequently used emoji is the crying loudly face."
I think that emojis are an essential communication tool for modern people.
Recently, many messaging and chat apps have enabled emoji reactions instead of just stamps.
Speedy, easy, no reply needed, and with a soothing element.
In modern communication, emojis are essential for creating a soft atmosphere that is highly valued.
So, I wonder what kind of emoji everyone is using.
[See all images] Ranking of popular emojis used in 2021. The top 10 most used emojis worldwide in 2021!
Overall, positive and bright emoji are ranked.
According to the source of Unicode, 92% of the world's internet population uses emojis.
First place accounts for 5% of the total usage of all emojis!
"The crying and laughing emoji in first, third, and fifth place are very convenient to use, aren't they?"
When it's fun, happy times, and of course, I've done it!
Sometimes, even when you feel like there's nothing you can do about it, there are still many people who use self-deprecating language.
If you have never used any of the top 10 emojis even once, that would be considered extremely rare.
I want them to stick to that style.

How do you dispose of computers and peripheral devices?
PC farm.
I have only brought it in once, but even though it is located in Misato City, Saitama Prefecture, they refuse to collect it for free from Saitama Prefecture.
(If it is relatively new, there is a free option)
Inverse net.
I haven't used it before, but apparently Sagawa offers completely free shipping with cash on delivery.
I'm thinking of trying it out, so if anyone knows about it, I would like to hear their feedback.
Instructions: Translate the following Japanese text into English. Japanese: * 粗大ごみ等（有料） 、追記＞自治体の回収ボックス（小物家電 無料）  English:  * Large waste items (for a fee), additional note> Municipal collection boxes (small appliances are free)
Sell it secondhand.
Addendum> Mercari, Hard-off.
I wonder if there are people who sell things on flea markets or auctions? I have never sold a used PC before.
Selling while it's still valuable might also be a wise choice.
Addendum> Information provided by /u/CheetahPresent8059, Linnet Japan.
Broken printers, old UPSs, and the like that no one will take are starting to get in the way.
It's probably not going to cost any money because it's not oversized garbage, but it's been put off for some reason.
I collect coins as a hobby.
Please, someone who knows how much these coins are worth, let me know.
Coins circulated in foreign countries have no value.
In Japan, paper money can be exchanged, but coins cannot be exchanged.
If it's a commemorative gold coin, it contains gold and therefore has value.
"Do you ever dislike someone even though they haven't done anything wrong?"
Yes, it's natural for humans to have likes and dislikes.
"(I don't know why), I just dislike it." Those who dislike something are like that.

It's not about the face, it's about the heart.
However, it's sad that things can be judged based on appearance.

What did you do with your school gym clothes after graduating?
I wear it as casual clothing ^_^
I threw it away immediately after graduation.
My wife used to wear roomwear until we started living together, haha.
Can a person become a "リア充" (someone with a fulfilling social life) at any age, even at 90 or over 100 years old?
Desire and youth are all lost eventually.

Men's volleyball advances to the tournament finals for the first time in 29 years! / Men's fencing's Frere finishes in fourth place, missing out on a medal.
Japan's men's volleyball team, "Ryujin Nippon," makes it to the quarterfinals for the first time in 29 years! Coach Nakagaki says, "It was a big goal."
At the second referee challenge, I thought it was over when they took the third set, but we won in the full set.
Men's fencing foil team fails to win a medal for Japan, as they lose to the United States.
I think they were exceptional compared to the opponents up to the semifinals, but why is such an opponent in the 3rd place playoff?
I would like to plant trees that can serve as a privacy screen in my garden. If you have any recommended species, please let me know.
As a hope, it would be good to have an evergreen tree that is easy to take care of and, if possible, produces fruit.
Nice to meet you / Please be kind to me / Thank you in advance (This phrase can have multiple translations depending on context, as it is a common phrase used in various situations.)
To bear fruit on a feijoa tree, it is recommended to plant other fruit bearing trees nearby such as olive, blueberry, plum, etc. This will help the feijoa tree to bear fruit.
What amount of savings do we need for us to be able to live together without any difficulty?
It depends on the person.
It depends on where you live and what kind of relationship you have.
It's better to not live together.
There is a high possibility of breaking up.
It is better to properly arrange a matchmaker, hold a betrothal ceremony, visit various bridal shops, and have a wedding ceremony and reception.
There are no benefits to living together.
I think it would be better to stop...
Today, I went to the game center and played an arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Ganbarizing.

I think it's an ant.
