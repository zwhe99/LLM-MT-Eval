Is there a way to punish him?
To avoid such incidents happening again.
Or how much longer until the restaurant is ready? Can you help me ask?
At the Zhejiang University Academic Annual Meeting, students took the leading roles and their research results sparked people's imagination - Xinhua News Agency.
Wash hands with air, diagnose disease through exhaling, and precisely search for the source of haze. At the opening ceremony of the academic year 2016 at Zhejiang University last night, a series of innovative academic achievements received recognition.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, and their research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life sciences, and humanities education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with practical value, and some of these projects have already won awards both domestically and internationally.
Bio-sensors: your home check-up doctor.
The team of doctoral student Zhang Diming from the School of Biomedical Engineering showcased an intelligent cellphone-based biosensor, which is only half the size of a regular smartphone.
"Just breathe into this device, and it will preliminarily detect your health condition from the composition of the exhaled gas."
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors can be connected to a smartphone. After exhaling gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
The smart wearable devices that can detect health conditions in the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
And this set of biological sensors uses a new material called graphene, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "sense of smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the state of one's health.
Intelligent surgical light: doctor's high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, intelligent surgical lamps are also being used in the operating room.
This invention received a silver award at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition in Switzerland this year.
Master students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, have opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lights, and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
"Many diseases cannot be detected and removed in the early stage, and it is related to the type of lamp used in the doctor's operating room."
Shen Junfei said that for example, when checking for early-stage cancer, if doctors cannot timely identify all tumor tissues, then cancer cells will continue to spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical light has four lamp heads and can enhance the differentiation of different tissues under the illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgical process, doctors can adjust the size of the light spot, brightness, spectrum, color evenness, and shadowlessness according to surgical needs and personal habits.
This type of intelligent surgical lamp has already been tested in hospitals such as Zhejiang University School of Medicine's affiliated hospital, Shao Yifu Hospital, and Zhejiang University School of Medicine's affiliated children's hospital, and has received positive feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: save water and be cool.
Ordinary people wash their hands by just rinsing them with water and perhaps rubbing some soap or squeezing some hand sanitizer. However, Li Qizhang and his classmates have invented a "handwashing device using air" system.
As long as we stand on the device of the sink, our weight can compress the air and come out.
"It's like a pump."
The compressed air forms a fluid at the water tap and combines with the water.
"Like this, we can wash our hands clean!"
The color reaction and bacteria residue test prove that the effectiveness of washing hands through this method is the same as that of the regular hand washing method.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can guarantee the cleanliness and save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many world-renowned universities and won the only gold award.

A very meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate.
This is one of the important skill certificates besides my driving license that I think is essential.
Just to clarify: first aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures taken when unexpected incidents occur, that is, rescue measures taken before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is actually a period of time between the occurrence of an accident and the arrival of the ambulance, and it is precisely during this period that is the most critical.
This is the time when emergency aid is needed.
If I really suffered a heart attack, stroke, or sudden respiratory failure, then our window of life would only be four minutes - the golden four minutes!
So it's really important for the people around us to know first aid!
When someone collapses beside us, we can use our professional knowledge to perform first aid on them instead of standing there doing nothing and feeling helpless. This feeling of helplessness is too terrifying.
"In China, according to official data, there are three million deaths due to accidents every year, and the most dangerous one is called sudden cardiac arrest."
On average, 15% can be saved in the United States nationwide.
"At the casino hotels in Las Vegas, 70-80% can be saved from gambling addiction, while in Shanghai and Beijing it's less than 1%."
This is said by Lu Le, founder of First Response.
If a person experiences sudden cardiac arrest, and there is no breathing or heartbeat, stimulating the acupoint between the thumb and index finger (known as the "Hegu" point) will have no effect.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed in order to save someone's life.
I found that not many people have the awareness to learn first aid now, but when things happen, it's too late. So, I still appeal to everyone to learn this skill so that we can react timely when facing emergencies.
Maybe it can save a life!
You can register for a first aid certificate at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai and there is even a discount for students.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals that I want to achieve before I turn 25. Adding a first aid certificate to the list is something I did a few months ago and I have indeed completed it!
Next, I plan to take other certifications that I want to take. I'm thinking of obtaining a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is also a diving first-aid certificate. It seems that one must have a first-aid certificate to take this other certificate, so in reality, first-aid certification is quite useful!
I have ordered ##NUMBER##.
"Only one shrimp dumpling for 13 yuan?"
Never tried.
Why is #NAME# not writing clearly?
Is it 13 yuan for one?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed sending the food items, and this time they only gave me one shrimp dumpling to eat!?
Because clearly I saw that the code I inputted before was valid.
First of all, speaking of the conclusion, I personally think that "Four Seas" is a comprehensive bad film, in every sense of the word.
But if you were to say that this movie doesn't have any highlights, that's not entirely true. At least the music score was selected well.
There are many types of bad movies, including ones that make you fall asleep in the theater and ones that make you leave filled with righteous indignation. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei, capable of igniting your fury in countless ways.
When it comes to insulting the audience, Han Han is truly gifted.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it seems like a creation from a Kafkaesque novel, indescribable and full of plot holes, just like the windbreaker on Little Ma's body.
"Even after watching it, you may suspect that there are hidden meanings implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you'll realize that it's actually just a piece of shit."
First, let me briefly explain some plot points that are difficult for me to understand.
The male protagonist's place of residence should be on a small island in the south, where he depends on his grandmother for survival.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and then the plot arranged for an old man in the neighborhood to drive her to Northeast China to see the snow in a small van.
"Old elderly people take a minibus from South to Northeast to see snow??"
He and his father are still very reassured about this.
Then the old man didn't continue speaking.
How did the female protagonist's brother obtain a business license to operate a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the street gang on the island who ride motorcycles easily block off a section of mountain road?
Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road stopped at the roadside, and even the truck driver could not be found around it.
"This prop feels too obvious, right?"
Why would a small-time criminal with a bad credit rating and suspected illegal activities become an auxiliary police officer?
Why don't people report loan sharks to the police? In the movie, the police even ask if there are any difficulties involved.
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone may not know how to use a room key card to unlock the door in a hotel, and then may forcefully try to find the hotel owner and end up sleeping outside the room for a night.
This kind of inexplicable plot fills the entire movie. Due to the plot being too absurd, even when I recall them, it makes me feel painful.
Apart from the plot, the worst thing about the movie is its theme, or rather, this movie doesn't even have a theme; it is a hideous patchwork monster.
At the beginning of the movie, you may think that it's going to be a comedy. After 20 minutes or so, you might guess that it's an inspirational film. Halfway through, you might think it's a drama about the struggles of young people in small towns. But after finishing it, you won't have a clue what you just watched, and you'll deeply question yourself - why did I spend my New Year's Eve watching a movie about poop in the cinema?
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcycle rider, you would use inspiration and comedy to tell the audience how a talented rookie takes steps towards success.
If you want to film a love story, then be honest and tell the story of the love and hate between a young man who likes riding motorcycles in a small town and a waitress.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot can't have things that contradict the normal world.
(For example, the character in the new motorcycle drama played by Yin Zheng, who can still sing after his motorcycle was burned), can't go for some mind-boggling ideas that even Kennedy couldn't stand to watch.
As for the female protagonist, although she is not mentally handicapped, she can behave like a 5-year-old in some aspects. I really don't know if this is due to her acting skills or the director's requirements.
There's one thing that I also can't understand. As a racing driver, why is Han Han so dedicated to adding crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this movie being scheduled for the Chinese New Year holiday season intended to cause trouble for the audience?

Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment. Introduction to Zhengzhou Well Brick Module Equipment.
Zhengzhou Yixin is a domestic manufacturer of equipment for concrete inspection well module brick machines, inspection well block machinery, and modular machinery for well wall and wall modules specializing in production, from semi-automatic to fully automated production lines.
Through years of practice and development, we now have high-quality products, mainly producing a series of hydraulic, mobile, and fully automated inspection well equipment and supporting devices.
Inspection of Concrete Module Production Equipment for Manhole Covers; Assembly Site of Zhengzhou Manhole Brick Module Equipment.
Features and Advantages of the Zhengzhou Well Brick Module Equipment for the Production and Processing of Concrete Modules for Inspection Wells.
The Yixin inspection well brick machine equipment is widely applicable to the new masonry materials of municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, gas, etc.
For example, various inspection wells, rainwater inlets, square grooves, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls and so on for drainage and water storage facilities.
The advantage of using concrete modules for building inspection wells is that the modules have concave-convex grooves on all four sides, which can be combined to form a chain-lock structure.
The shear resistance of a wall constructed with the form of well-wall masonry is far superior to that of plain friction masonry.
The module is a hollow structure, with longitudinal holes communicating with each other and transverse holes intersecting with each other after combined masonry. After pouring the core of the hole, it forms a cast-in-place concrete mesh structure, which plays a role of secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The modules have grooves for inserting reinforcements both horizontally and vertically, which enhances the overall structural strength.
In addition, inspection wells and drainage wells built using concrete inspection well modules are not easily prone to collapse, sinking, and leakage. The module's mechanical performance is stable, the operation is simple, and the formed size is standard.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine is equipped with intelligent control and data input/output devices. The one-button touch LCD display can monitor the entire mechanical operation process, achieving the desired human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of material comparison, density operation, safety logic control, and fault diagnosis system.
The well wall module machinery hydraulic system uses single-cylinder hydraulic transmission and dual-cylinder hydraulic transmission.
An independent hydraulic integrated station avoids the influence of the main engine vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system operation.
The concrete inspection well module brick-making machine equipment fabric box traveling module box is lifted off the mold, the material box door is closed, and the automatic conveying tray is completed independently by the hydraulic system, thereby reducing mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment uses imported computers and electrical components, sealed hydraulic components, and is equipped with comprehensive and stable performance assurance.
The well wall and panel module mechanical vibration platform uses integral plate steel, and the table top is cut and molded without welding points, allowing the filling box to swing freely and reducing mechanical wear to a great extent.
Reduce the workload of the mold, combine the filling and compacting amplitude, and adopt integrated, fully synchronized vibration for both the table and mold to ensure a solid vibration effect.
The wall module mechanical vibration machine for well walls adjusts the amplitude automatically through computer control according to the cost-effectiveness of the raw materials, without any wear and tear from braking, thereby extending the service life and reducing costs.
The well wall module has a dual function of mechanical automatic control and manual control.

Chongqing Vocational School Pilots Modern Apprenticeship System, Enrolling Students as Prospective Employees of Enterprises - Xinhua News Agency.
Yesterday, it was learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship system" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students trained under the pilot program will simultaneously have the status of apprentices and after enrollment, they will be pre-registered by pilot enterprises as unit employees.
The Municipal Education Commission requires standardized enrollment and employment procedures for secondary vocational schools and enterprises, clarifying the dual identity of apprentices as both secondary vocational school students and prospective employees. They are expected to follow the principle of mutual selection, sign a trilateral agreement amongst the apprentice, school, and enterprise. For apprentices who are over 16 years old but not yet 18, an agreement must be signed by the apprentice, guardian, school, and enterprise to determine the specific position, teaching content, and rights protection for on-the-job apprenticeship training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt the modern apprenticeship system and collaborate with partner companies to provide on-the-job training and job-transfer training to employees.
The pilot schools need to reform the talent cultivation mode.
Collaboratively design talent development programs for schools and enterprises, develop professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program has a training period as a pilot cycle. During the internship period in enterprises, students will follow the talent development plan according to their majors, and the on-the-job internship usually lasts for six months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented. Based on the characteristics of different professions, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group, ensuring that students master the skills required for each training position.
According to the plan, from 2016 to August 2019, our city will establish 60 pilot projects for modern apprenticeship system in vocational schools at the municipal level, in three batches. Each pilot project will have around 50 participants, with a total of approximately 3,000 students (apprentices) being trained.
Following the principle of trying first and then promoting, gradually advancing from point to surface, we explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for school-enterprise joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education to effectively enhance students' job skills, improve students' employment rate and quality of employment.
My app shows "delivered" but I haven't received it yet.
I just ordered takeout, and I don't know if it's hung at the doorstep.
Then ask for a resend.
I live in Sheung Shui, why is the order in Seaview Garden?
Did you get the address wrong?
I have been considering this vacuum cleaner for a long time, and finally decided to buy it. The suction effect is good, and there is noticeably less dust in the house. However, it is a bit heavy when using it with just one hand, and the wet mopping function could be improved as it leaves traces of dust when going back and forth. Overall, I am still very satisfied with it.
The food processor is quite heavy and looks high-end. It's suitable for someone like me who is new to the kitchen. My child says that the food I make with the processor tastes better than when I cook it myself. I've made two meat dishes and two vegetable dishes, and the sweet and sour pork is especially delicious. It takes a bit longer to cook but other dishes are quick and the noise level is low. I don't have to worry about burning the food or not knowing how to cook it!
Received the goods and couldn't wait to stir fry three dishes at noon. It's really amazing how technology has changed our lives. With precise control of heat and seasoning, the taste of the dishes has been upgraded to a professional chef level. It's a great tool for those who are not good at cooking. I recommend buying it!
I have added a new member to the kitchen.
An intelligent cooking machine that can automatically control the fire and automatically stir-fry.
No more fear of being scalded by hot oil, no more fear of overcooking or undercooking the food due to poor control of the heat.
The dishes cooked by someone else are much tastier than the ones I made myself. The tomato and egg stir-fry is particularly flavorful and the eggs have a great texture.
This pot was bought at good value.
The item is good, worth buying, and very good.
As a whole, it's very good, very clear and consistent with the description.
Worth having.
The customer service is also very good.
The screen is large and clear, easy on the eyes, and no other abnormalities have been discovered at the moment.
Compared to mainstream monitors nowadays, it is thicker with slightly wider borders and larger gap between the border and the screen. However, the screen display effect is good and accessories are complete.
Fast logistics speed!
The service attitude of the merchants is good!
After using it for a while, the quality is good, and the screen resolution is also very clear.
Stock trading is fantastic, 4 cents per share, it's too perfect.
Fast logistics, good products, this is indeed a good thing as my second purchase. The display screen is of high quality and does not distort even though the screen is large. It has a complete set of interfaces.
The sensation is good, the color restoration is good, and the quality is acceptable.
The China Children's Center will hold a series of events to let children celebrate "Children's Day" with "high-tech" - Xinhua News Agency.
Beijing, May 20th (Huang Xiaoxi and Zhou Shanshan) - According to the news from the China Children's Center, a series of activities including children's maker experience, children's visual arts festival, and parent-child book carnival will be held by the center from May 28th to June 1st, before and after the Children's Day, allowing children to spend a delightful "Children's Day" in the charm of cutting-edge technology.
It is understood that during this year's Children's Day, the China Children's Center will hold activities including the "Love Family Creative Cool" Children's Future Learning Carnival, the first Children's Visual Arts Festival, the "Bookish Carnival" activity, and the "Whole Family Love Reading" picture book series activities.
On the media communication meeting for the 2016 Children's Day held on the 20th, Li Zhongming, the deputy director of the China Children's Center, introduced that the "Love Home Cool Creation" Children's Future Learning Carnival is the key activity for celebrating Children's Day at the China Children's Center this year.
The activity focuses on the organic combination of social innovation and personal creativity in families. By involving children and families in experiencing various innovative educational activities, innovation practices become a cultural gene for the general public family, and "hands-on work" becomes a new learning and lifestyle for many families.
It is reported that the "Love Family Cool Creation" Children's Future Learning Carnival includes dozens of cutting-edge technology experience contents such as the "Douguo Maker" experience activity, the Old Cow Children's Exploratory Museum anniversary celebration and the "Exploration of the Whole Family Love Children's Playful June 1st" activity, the VR National Experience Program, the "Maker Tribe" interactive workshops, etc.
"Stir-fried pork belly rice becomes pickled pork belly rice."
"Do we have to spend $100 or $200 again to be able to use it?"
It's worrying, how much longer do we have to wait to complete it.
Okay, thank you.
"Did the same rider deliver it to me?"
May I ask if you can help follow up?
The restaurant says that the food has been cooked for more than half an hour.
But no delivery driver came to the store to pick up the food.
South African doctor: Although Omicron variant spreads quickly, it is mostly mild cases.
Many doctors and healthcare experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, despite the fact that it spreads more quickly.
According to reports from the Associated Press, with the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng Province, South Africa, have reported that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughs similar to flu-like symptoms.
The organization's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees several dozen patients every day, but so far no patients have needed to be hospitalized.
Pilai said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said that this includes elderly patients and those who have health issues, who are more likely to develop severe symptoms if infected with the coronavirus.
He said that compared to the previous wave of Delta epidemic, the new coronavirus patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels".
"Many people will have to be hospitalized within a few days."
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although collecting sufficient data still requires a few weeks' time, the doctor's observation and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, in recent weeks only 30% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have severe symptoms, which is half of the proportion of the previous outbreak. The average length of hospitalization has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days. In recent cases of COVID-19, only 3% have died, while the death rate was as high as 20% in the early outbreak in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Research Institute, cited data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports, stating, "Currently, almost all indications suggest that this is a milder disease."
He also said: "It's still early stages, we need to gain data from later stages."
"Usually, hospitalization and death occur later, but we have only been in this wave of the epidemic for two weeks."
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta variant remains a major strain of the COVID-19 virus worldwide, Omicron cases are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, in the first week of December, newly discovered cases in the province of Haodeng increased by 400%, and tests showed that more than 90% of the cases were of the Omicron variant.
Thank you to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been given out!

Education commentary: What is needed to save abducted children?
If we draw an analogy to the famous public service announcement that "no trade, no harm", then in a good environment without a high demand for child abduction, community prevention and control, and the entire society's efforts to combat kidnapping, will make kidnapping behavior unprofitable, risky, and costly, and this type of crime will not happen again and again.
Recently, the Child Trafficking Investigation Office of China's Ministry of Public Security launched an emergency release platform for missing children.
This is an internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for publishing information on missing children and to promptly retrieve abducted children.
Upon hearing that this app is called "Reunion", I suddenly feel a heartwarming sensation.
The new techniques not only have poetic names and are full of emotions, but also utilize information technology appropriately, making them practical and effective.
The top priority of cracking down on abduction and trafficking is to find the missing children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
Next is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can list many "big words".
But before the trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
Different matters have different levels of importance and urgency. Under the urgent goal of "rescue", topics that have sparked heated debate and controversial views, such as "whether child abduction should receive the death penalty uniformly," can be temporarily set aside for careful discussion. However, we cannot delay in helping rescued abducted children, etc.
Based on the investigation experience of such cases, human traffickers tend to leave the crime scene as soon as possible after a successful operation.
If a kidnapping operation is delayed by even one minute, the child may be one step further away from their parents and the difficulty of solving the case will increase.
In this situation, taking actions such as using platforms like "Tuan Yuan" directly helps solve cases and recover missing children, which is indeed a practical approach.
After all, "anti-trafficking" is a big task that requires the entire legal system to work well.
To combat crime, protect the rights of children and parents, it is necessary to implement the care of "protecting the young and supporting the weak" in every aspect, from the improvement of legislation, to the assurance of judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement of law.
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be done even better from the family to the society.
For example, in a common case, a family of three is resting at a train station, with the parents asleep and only waking up to discover that their child is missing.
We cannot expect a two-year-old child to have enough self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, we should at least have a certain level of awareness of protection.
Parents taking turns resting, or placing their children under adequate protection, are the bare minimum measures to prevent children from being abducted.
Looking at the other side of cracking down on trafficking crimes by the police, the party who purchases the kidnapped children should also be monitored and punished.
Individual illegal behaviors are often just a link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory penalty for the crime of kidnapping and trafficking of children is 5 years; in cases of particularly serious circumstances, the death penalty may be imposed, and property may be confiscated.
With the trend towards lighter sentencing, the crime of child trafficking clearly belongs to the category of more severe punishments, with high starting points and maximum penalties.
Even until now, there are still a considerable number of trafficking cases happening every year.
It is evident that some people have outdated ideas about raising children and a weak awareness of the law.
Legal education for this group of people should be synchronized and kept up-to-date.
To effectively control human trafficking crimes, strict law enforcement by the authorities is not enough.
If the rampant "market" for child abduction exists, the abductors are blinded by greed and constantly innovate their methods, leading to a confrontation with law enforcement. Anti-abduction actions are bound to become inefficient and bogged down.
Therefore, getting rid of backward thinking and popularizing legal knowledge can also help eradicate child trafficking and purchasing crimes.
Yang Haodong gave a speech on the spirit of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial Party Congress at Malanshan.
Draw strength from the Communist Party's century-long struggle for progress.
On December 10th, according to the unified arrangement of the provincial committee, Yang Haodong, a member of the provincial standing committee and the minister of the provincial propaganda department, gave an interactive speech on video and cultural creativity at the Malan Mountain video and cultural creativity park to deeply learn and implement the spirit of the 6th plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, the important speeches and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping on Hunan, and the spirit of the 12th provincial Party Congress. This news was reported by the Hunan Daily on December 10th.
Yang Haodong comprehensively and systematically expounded the core essence and practical requirements of the Full Session's spirit, combining his personal insights and experiences from three aspects: ideals and beliefs, original mission and self-revolution, youthfulness and leading the party, and the party's ideology. He did so in an easily understandable manner.
He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the plenary session with the important speeches, instructions and comments made by General Secretary Xi Jinping on Hunan, as well as the spirit of the Provincial Party Congress, to enhance our ideological consciousness, political consciousness and actions in defending the "two establishes" and "two maintainings", to thoroughly understand and apply these teachings and move forward resolutely in the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
During the interactive communication session, grassroots cadres, business representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between three historical resolutions, the decisive significance of "two establishings", how cultural enterprises can grasp the guidance, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the Party's century-long history. Yang Haodong answered each question in simple language and vivid examples, earnestly urging young party members to draw inspiration from the Party's century-long struggle history, closely unite around the Party Central Committee, and steadfastly follow the Party, using their youth to dedicate themselves to responsibilities and contributions.

Unable to trace.
I hope you guys can understand/learn about it.
Because the delivery time was 30 minutes earlier than displayed.
There isn't any, thank you.
Yes, we've already changed the delivery rider.
He has been waiting for a long time.

Waited for several hours.
The International Olive Oil Council divides olive oil into two major categories: virgin olive oil and refined olive oil, with five different levels.
Extra virgin olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is the oil extracted directly from fresh olives through mechanical cold pressing, and after filtering out impurities.
According to the different acidity levels, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
The taste is superb, with a subtle and pleasant plant fragrance, and acidity not exceeding 1%.
High-quality extra-virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%. The taste is pure and aromatic.
Ordinary virgin olive oil: The taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained by refining extra virgin olive oil with acidity exceeding 3.3%, also known as "second oil".
Extra-virgin olive oil can be classified into two levels:
Regular Olive Oil: Refined olive oil blended with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to adjust taste and color. Its acidity is below 1.5%, and it appears as a transparent light golden yellow color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil is olive oil extracted from olive pomace through a solvent process, which is then refined.
As someone who has checked the grading system, you may have already noticed that acidity is a very important indicator of olive oil.
You should know that olive fruits are like grapes for making wine. Olive fruits from different growing regions and different olive varieties will produce olive oil of different standards.
The optimal growing area for olive oil:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions, such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity, and precipitation, for the growth of olive trees.
Apart from the Mediterranean coast, only sporadic planting can be done in other regions within the suitable habitat zone.
Main production areas / origins (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and so on, as well as countries with similar climates like Argentina, Peru, and South Africa located far south of the equator.
Harvest season of olives:
From March to June every year is when olive trees bloom and bear fruit, and from July to October the fruit starts to develop and ripen. The fruit transitions from green to red, then purple, and finally becomes black.
From November to February of the following year is the season for harvesting fruit (freshness is very important for olive oil).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in a variety of monounsaturated fatty acids, including oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered the most nutritionally suitable oil for the human body among all oils discovered so far.
The democratic summit has come to an end, and Biden claims that the fire of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy", convened by US President Biden and attended by government officials, civil society leaders, and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, concluded on Friday, December 10th.
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of freedom burns in the heart of every person in the world, and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also stated that there are plans to hold the second Global Democracy Summit next year.
Taiwan government representative and political affairs commissioner Tang Fenghe and Hong Kong democratic human rights activist in exile in the UK, Nathan Law, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the work ahead of us is."
But we also know that we can meet challenges, because as I said before, as demonstrated by this summit, democracy is everywhere in the world.
"An authoritarian regime can never extinguish the small flame of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all around the world."
Biden also said that defending democracy requires joint efforts from the whole society.
He said, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the democratic barriers, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, resist the buffering and impact of authoritarianism, and those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public interest."
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" are defending human rights, consolidating democracy and resisting authoritarianism, and fighting back against digital authoritarianism while affirming the value of democracy.
This day happens to be "International Human Rights Day".
UN Secretary-General Guterres also stated in his opening speech on that day that the democratic cause is facing challenges worldwide, particularly challenges brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said, "Now is the time to reaffirm our common values and stance, as well as the resilience of democracy."
This requires deepening social dialogue, resolving inequality issues, combating corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist, Joshua Wong, gave a speech to the summit via pre-recorded video, reminding attendees to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong and Chinese minorities such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has been experiencing China's rise, but no mechanism has been established to hold it accountable."
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must collaborate.
"We must use everything (resources) we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority task."
Lawmaker Nathan Law also called for solidarity among the free world to fight against the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party.
He said, "Perhaps some of you are afraid of angering General Secretary Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, and perhaps some of you haven't realized the threat that (the Chinese Communist Party) poses to our democratic values."
And this is the reason why we failed.
"This is also the reason we must change."
Taiwan's Executive Yuan's Minister Without Portfolio, Tang Feng, emphasized Taiwan's position at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and dictatorship during a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values" by releasing a video statement titled "National Declaration".
He also shared his experience in combating the new coronavirus epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said, "At a time when democracy in Taiwan is flourishing, we remain steadfast in standing at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leadership role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights."
During the epidemic period, authoritarian governments in various regions use public health and collective interests as a reason to justify violations of human rights, indicating a global regression of democracy.
However in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without locking down the city, and we can defeat fake news without taking it down.
On the second day of the "Democracy Summit," the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea and a few other countries who were found to have seriously violated human rights. Additionally, there were investment restrictions imposed on a Chinese company that was found to be assisting in human rights violations using surveillance technology.
I have already taken photos and uploaded them to you.
I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why it keeps delaying the delivery time.
Original meaning: To require/need #NUMBER#.
Anyway, I won't call anymore.
Not eating anymore.
I will definitely make a complaint.
"If you can't deliver it, why didn't you tell me earlier?"
Waited for you for so long.
No, I did not receive a call.
Please inform him to deliver it to our company again.
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes anymore.

I want to cancel the order.
Why not cancel it?
Hello, the saliva chicken delivered by the restaurant is raw.
I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a practice partner of similar price first.
Unfriendly. In fact, price often correlates with friendliness. If you cannot distinguish, then the more expensive option will usually be friendlier than the cheaper option. These so-called "beginner racquets" are actually industrial garbage.
"Their strength is very low, and when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very strong. The hard ball is difficult to control, even for skilled players."
The logic and hidden meaning of their existence is to deceive you with cheap goods, knowing that tennis is difficult and that you won't learn it, and that you will not want to spend money on expensive equipment. They want you to buy their cheap racquets and play a few times, but then give up on tennis altogether, so that you won't feel bad about the low price you paid.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means you have improved. Then come to me and buy the expensive ones, and I will make twice the money.
Suggestion: Spend a similar amount of money and buy a secondhand, better quality racquet. Choose brands like Prince or Dunlop, as they are not well-known enough to drive up the price of good racquets. A new racquet priced at 500 or 600 is good enough, while a secondhand one priced at 200 can give you the same enjoyment as a thousand-yuan racquet, isn't that great?
It is quite friendly to beginners, but it becomes mediocre once the beginner stage is over. However, most people, particularly girls, cannot get past the beginner stage.
The delivery time of the order has been delayed multiple times.
May I ask if you can help follow up on something?
Delay
Thank you.
So, you mean to say that I already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order next? Should I ignore the previous order?

Actually, there are many details to pay attention to when it comes to dressing for girls with slightly chubby bodies.
Girls with a fat body should not wear skirts that are too short or too long, the length should be around the knee to cover the fat thighs.
A skirt that is too short will reveal the fat on the legs.
If it's too long, it will give people a short and fat feeling.
If you wear clothes that visually separate into three sections (upper, middle, and lower), it will make you appear taller naturally. For example, using different colors for your top, skirt, and knee-high socks will create a sense of elongation.
Actually, many dark-colored clothes are the go-to choice for slightly overweight girls (the author deeply understands this). Dark colors are also a good way to disguise your body fat. A noble and elegant black mini skirt is also the top choice for slightly overweight girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially a short black skirt, will make people feel that you are thinner.
If your calves are too fat, do not wear socks and shoes that draw too much attention.
The more popular it is, the better, and the color should not be too bright.
To avoid giving people the impression of obesity when they pay attention to your legs and feet.
For slightly chubby girls, it is important to talk about the tips for dressing well and matching clothes.
Girls who are slightly overweight should never wear tight short skirts. Also, their tops should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, as it would make people feel uncomfortable. If their legs are thick, they should wear black long stockings or fishnet stockings (the ones with small grids). Choose a soft printed A-line skirt, paired with a loose neck top, which can cover up the shortcomings of overweight girls very well.
Of course, there are also considerations when a slightly chubby girl wears a short skirt.
A chubby girl wearing a short skirt should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which will make your plump figure appear taller.
Short skirts paired with high heels can make your legs appear more slender. This is the most fashionable combination during the summer season.
If you have a chubby upper body but slim legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous style dress.
Not only can it cover up the big belly, but it can also showcase your strengths.
An A-line skirt will make you look slimmer, and it is more suitable for chubby girls. Choose a tighter-fitting top to create a layered feeling that will make you look even thinner.
Simply wear a white t-shirt with a short skirt, even plus-sized women can give it a try.
Curvy girls can also wear fashionable clothes.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing well, slightly overweight girls will also be the focus of attention.
After making changes in clothing matching, we should also exercise more in life, and strive to get rid of the label of slightly chubby girls as soon as possible. 😄

Xinhua All-Media+ | Beijing Youth Ice Hockey League fuels enthusiasm for Winter Olympics - Xinhua News Agency.
On December 11th, Pang Yaotian (center), a player of the Beijing Dreaming ING team, took a shot during the game.

Girl offers herself as target for fundraising for her elder sister: "I just think it's just skin and flesh injury" - Xinhua News Agency
In Wulin Square, Hangzhou, a girl was standing in front of a large wooden board that had the words "human target, ten yuan per arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl willing to be a target for fundraising for her sister" went viral in the social media circle.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a slightly taller wooden board at Hangzhou Wulin Square. The board is labeled "Human Target, 10 yuan per arrow", indicating that passers-by can pay to use a bow and arrow to shoot at it.
The action has sparked a heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xicheng Sub-Bureau of Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to a reporter of the Beijing News that the police have confirmed that the girl made such an extreme move as soliciting donations for her sister. However, this kind of behavior is not worth promoting. After being admonished, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl warned for soliciting donations with a "dartboard" on the street
In the circulating picture, a long-haired girl stands in a "person" shape in front of a large wooden board, on which is written in black ink "Human target, ten yuan per arrow". Another wooden board in front of her has her bank account and WeChat, Alipay account and other information written on it.
The image posted online has caused controversy.
Some netizens think that this is a "begging behavior to attract attention", while many other netizens expressed sympathy for it.
"We discovered the situation around 10 AM on the 23rd while patrolling near the square. At that time, there were already quite a few onlookers."
The police officers from the Tianshui police station near the incident site, in an interview with local media, stated that there were two girls setting up stalls, both around 20 years old, dressed in a youthful and beautiful manner.
Among them, the girl who played as the "human target" has been crying and asking passersby to play the game. Another girl was helping to shout on the side, saying that her friend's sister has leukemia and urgently needs surgery fees, asking everyone to help.
"We have contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the person in charge of publicity for the Xicheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told a reporter from the Beijing News that the girl's name is Jilia and she is raising funds for her older sister Jia Yan.
But as the treatment still requires more than 300,000 yuan in expenses and there was no good way to fundraise for it, that's why they resorted to this behavior.
He said that during the whole process, there were two girls involved, one acted as the target and the other assisted in shooting, but they did not actually participate. It was not found that anyone shot an arrow during the process, only some people watched and took photos which were then posted to Weibo.
After being appraised by the public security department, the bow and arrow used do not fall within the scope of regulation.
The responsible person expressed that "they do not promote the use of this sensationalist fundraising method".
After being admonished by the police at the police station, she has already left the police station.
Heat dissipation effect: good. Lightness degree: convenient. Appearance material: satisfactory. Acer has always had a high cost performance.
The new machine is very good.
Stable performance, no problem with the four air outlets for cooling, recommended.
This Acer Predator Dragon Gaming Laptop is pretty good, with solid workmanship and materials. You can trust the brand!
The price of Acer Predator Helios Dragon is not considered expensive.
Personally, I think Acer's Predator Helios 300 is really good. Its gaming performance is smooth and it can handle most games easily. My FPS in PUBG stays high and stable, making the gameplay very smooth. Even games like League of Legends and CS:GO are a breeze to play, and it can handle most AAA games.
Cooling Performance: The cooling performance is good, the fan is strong, and it works quietly. Even with all game settings maxed out, the fan is still not too loud.
Appearance and material: The appearance is quite cool and stylish, as expected for a gaming laptop. Display performance: The screen is very clear, 1080 resolution is enough for gaming.
I think the notebook I bought is really great. It is mainly used for design and has a high cost performance. It is lighter than I imagined and looks better than I imagined too. The red color on the bottom is a very nice wine color, not too flashy. Overall, it exceeded my expectations and is a very worthwhile purchase. It is also suitable for female users.
Started using the Acer Dark Knight two years ago, and after using it for two years, it has a good price-performance ratio and is of high quality!
I also recommend my friends around me to purchase this product!
We have already purchased three machines from this series!
The appearance is beautiful and nice, and the configuration is also very good.
Bought it for my nephew, originally planned to wait for the 418 bank event, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance, and missed the big bank event, feeling a bit regretful.
However, the cost performance is quite high, and the logistics is also quite fast. Let's come back for a follow-up review after using it for a while.
Brand new and original, a high cost-effective gaming laptop with great design style that is already installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
Display effect: Bought for the child to do 3D rendering, software already installed, child said it can be used without problems, this computer has good performance for doing 3D design work.
Bought for my son, he said it's very good.
The computer is quite good, especially the customer service has a great attitude. They will answer any questions you have and I recommend buying it.
Not bad, the graphics quality of the game is really great.
What is the hottest trend in 2021?
Undoubtedly, it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, an article titled "Look! Project Managers Can Compete in Olympic Events" was very popular, which mentioned that project managers are definitely capable of being at the forefront in many projects, and no one can match them: manual labor, business trips, and staying up late are all part of the project manager's daily routine, and handling emergencies, taking responsibility, and apologizing are even more commonplace.
Although seemingly a joke or banter, this article reveals the daily struggles of project managers, and represents the frustration they feel in their inability to effectively manage projects.
And those who are engaged in project management work gradually choose to take some actions to free themselves from the difficulties in their work.
From the increasing number of registrations for the PMP (international certified qualification for project management professionals) every year, it can be seen that more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the "Chinese Project Management 20-Year Development Report (1999-2019)," as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® exam takers in China was nearly 600,000, with around 420,000 people certified as PMPs® and approximately 300,000 holding valid certifications, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMPs® worldwide.
In the past decade, the number of PMP certified individuals has been increasing year by year, which indicates that more and more project managers have realized that relying on simply copying past "old experiences" to work is no longer feasible. The rapidly changing work environment has taught us that we must learn how to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the path forward.
However, does taking the PMP exam guarantee that there will be no obstacles in project management work?
Many beginners in project management say that by learning related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the ten domains of project management and five process groups, but they still feel confused when actually doing project management work.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: inadequate understanding of project management, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theory but not knowing how to put it into practice; lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to implement it in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control sensitivity, projects are delayed constantly; unclear division of labor among team members, difficulty in handling experienced team members, poor communication and collaboration across departments, making it difficult to push forward with the project...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and research and development management for more than a decade, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting has helped many excellent enterprises cultivate a large number of research and development key talents such as product managers and project managers, and has won honors such as "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base". Now, it comes with the online course of "Special Training Camp for Research and Development Project Managers".
"Research and Development Project Manager Training Camp" online course. This is a form of online fragmented learning that combines a variety of practical cases, tools, and methods from many research and development-oriented enterprises to help you master the essential knowledge and standard actions required of a project manager and advance in your own project management career.
This is also an opportunity for businesses to promote the development of project managers with lower costs and less investment, and to bring about efficient operating results for the company.
"Talk is cheap, let's see what other students have to say about this course: This course is not only taught by the Zhongtian Huaxia expert team (formerly the Huawei R&D management team), but also combines international advanced project management methodology and numerous well-known business scenarios to provide in-depth and easy-to-understand professional explanations of the course content."
It also provides scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms, and helps students translate and apply the content to practical work after class.

"Jeanshin advocates for rational consumption to consumers on the eve of 'December 12th' - Economic Observer Network - a professional financial news website."
This year's "Double Eleven" shopping festival saw a national online payment transaction amount of 1.77 trillion yuan, reaching a new high compared to previous years.
The various forms of reduced-price red envelopes and eye-catching live-streamed sales promotions have once again made consumers shout out in benefit. This consumer frenzy makes people marvel at the ever-strengthening national consumption power, but at the same time, it also makes us reflect on the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer population.
On the eve of "Double Twelve", JDC Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "JDC") issued a call for rational consumption, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good awareness and habit of consumption, and to refuse blind and excessive consumption.
According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in financial consumption, but there are significant differences in financial behavior and skills, which require further improvement in basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of both elderly and young people is relatively low, and "the young and the old" will continue to be the focus of financial education. Nielsen's report on the debt situation of young people in China and CCTV's report on youth consumption in 2019-2020 show that the younger generation has tremendous consumption potential, with credit consumption becoming an important way of upgrading consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a trend of rational consumption, which is far from the "excessive squandering" label attached by the outside world, some young people do exhibit overconsumption and herd behavior, leading to excessive financial pressure and debt risk, and even increasing social problems. Financial enterprises should be brave enough to undertake social responsibility and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Cofidis has always been committed to assisting people in building their own happy lives through quality and considerate services. It advocates that consumers establish good and correct consumption views, and actively responds to regulatory calls to promote consumers, especially young people, to have a rational consumption consciousness through practical actions.
In the past few years, Jie Xin has continuously carried out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities aimed at young people, including college students. Through various forms, such as collaborating with top domestic universities to launch innovative practice competitions, it subtly guides the consumption needs of young people, helps them establish rational consumption concepts, reasonably plan their consumption needs, and ultimately helps them accumulate wealth for their lives.
As the Double Twelve approaches, Citi reminds all consumers to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and a correct view of money. Resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid consumption loan misunderstandings to avoid affecting personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, it is important to plan ahead, within one's means and make repayments on time.
If you are overdue, the record of being overdue will be recorded in your personal credit report, which may have an adverse impact on your future economic life such as buying a car or buying a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose legitimate institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Jie Xin will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated financial products to provide consumers with services that are more in line with their needs and diversified. Jie Xin will continue to help improve the financial knowledge of the public, and help consumers cultivate a concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, making Jie Xin a lifelong trusted partner in consumer finance.

Vietnam People's Newspaper Website - Gulf Cooperation Council responds to common challenges.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit of Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar in the middle of 2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive blockade on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tension has seriously affected the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blockaded land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
This crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, with all Gulf countries signing an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait aimed at moving towards "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are working to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in Qatar from both countries.
The resolution of the Gulf Arab countries' differences with Qatar and the restoration of their relationship is derived from the necessity for all countries to unite for their own interests and regional stability, aimed at addressing common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, both sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two neighboring Gulf countries.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor linking the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens and the integration of supply chains of the two countries.
The Public Investment Fund (PIF) of Saudi Arabia plans to invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' companies have signed 13 cooperation memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Gulf countries coincides with Iran negotiating with world powers regarding the Iran nuclear deal named the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - an agreement that Gulf Arab nations have condemned for failing to address Iran's missile issues.
Gulf countries have always viewed Iran as a long-term "competitor" and regard Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
Each Gulf country believes that failing to address the issue of Iran's missiles and not taking action to curb its activities in the region is flawed.
Against the backdrop of the failure of major countries' negotiations with Iran to meet the wishes of Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia held direct talks with Iran.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors that slows down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first summit of GCC countries since some member countries resolved their dispute with Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess its diplomatic achievements in promoting the restoration of GCC unity, and to propose measures to enable its member countries to collaborate fully in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of Gulf countries.

Claimed to have the loudest exhaust sound in the New Mountain District for supercars!
This time, our team brings you a car that is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is almost 2 million Malaysian ringgit, with an annual road tax of tens of thousands of Malaysian ringgit. It has four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Well, I don't really know either, but the data shows that the 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds. That means when my Myvi reaches 30km/h, the other car would have already hit 100km/h.
The low and aggressive body, the bold scissor doors, the huge intakes around the body, and the 6.5 V12 engine under the glass that allows a clear view, perfectly interprets the Lamborghini style.
There's no need to say too much about the car models, you can just Google them yourself. However, the assistant has compiled some explanations that Google may not necessarily provide.
Being too much in the spotlight, everyone is watching wherever I go, making me feel uncomfortable! (Actually, it's a bit exhilarating)
The cost of one kilometer of fuel is around RM1 (car owners don't care at all).
You should practice the proper way to get in and out of the car, otherwise it might be a bit awkward (because you might crawl out of the car and get stuck halfway).
"The sound of the engine is too loud. After getting off, you will instantly become deaf. (But it's still enjoyable.)"
"The car is too big, and it will be very narrow when parked in a regular parking space. I am very afraid of being hit by the neighboring car when they open their door!"
Feeling a bit lonely because there are no opponents on the road (I'm saying this myself, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha).
Everyone please don't misunderstand, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos for their beloved cars, please feel free to contact us!
More car news that you don't know about can be found in The Car Guide / People's Automotive Journal.
Involved in a car accident worth millions of dollars in value!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are both well-known to car enthusiasts. The Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, while the Porsche 911 is also in the million-dollar price range!
On that day, abroad, within just a few minutes, a million-dollar Porsche 911 and a ten-million-dollar supercar Chiron were crashed.
"Looking at the results, being expensive makes sense!"
Resonate the spirit of university with the spirit of the times - Xinhua News Agency.
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational philosophies and value pursuits that have been accumulated and formed by a university in its development process, and is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present day, the spirit of the university is essential for the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, the university has shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For China's universities, rising in the autumn of national danger, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changing times, advocating the values of "enlightenment and service to society, cultivating personal character and governing the country, and promoting learning to strengthen the nation" patriotism.
Currently, the trends of informationization and internationalization in higher education are becoming increasingly obvious. The global competition in education, technology, and talent is constantly intensifying. As an important supplier, the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
Especially the proposal of the "Overall Plan for Developing World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines", which not only demonstrates China's confidence and determination to advance from a large country of higher education to a strong one, but also presents higher and newer requirements for university development.
How to make great efforts to break into the ranks of the world's top in a shorter period of time, and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a batch of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap, and achieve "overtaking on a curve"?
In addition to having confidence in their goals, pathways, and abilities, universities should also fully leverage three advantages. The first is the advantage of being a latecomer, which can be achieved by continuously introducing outstanding academic talents from overseas and learning from the advanced experiences of top universities in the world, to significantly improve academic standards and quality of education. The second is the advantage of cultural heritage, inheriting the wisdom and essence of Chinese civilization accumulated over 5,000 years, promoting and developing excellent traditional culture to unite strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image. The third is the advantage of the system, by tapping into the superiority of the socialist country's system, strengthening goal-driven action, pooling consensus and efforts, optimizing resource allocation, and providing sustainable solid support for universities to catch up with and even surpass the world's advanced levels.
It is particularly important to realize that building world-class universities cannot be accomplished with a one-size-fits-all approach. While each school plays to its strengths, it must also showcase its own personality and characteristics.
The characteristic of running a school should not only have the common characteristics of Chinese culture, but also reflect the unique goals, traditions, and resource endowments of each individual school.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we focus on highlighting three aspects of characteristics in our education: Firstly, we emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, building an integrated education environment that combines science and education as well as school-enterprise cooperation to form a full chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem. Secondly, we promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system by highlighting the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, creating a system environment for interdisciplinary convergence, and actively cultivating emerging interdisciplinary fields and iconic interdisciplinary achievements. Thirdly, we highlight the characteristics of our education system and social services, carrying out in-depth international exchange and cooperation, and accelerating the formation of a comprehensive Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always uphold the spirit of the university, and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University consists of the motto of "Seeking Truth, Pursuing Innovation," the shared values of "Diligence, Virtue, Discrimination, and Practicality," and the shared principles of "Embracing all rivers and seas, cultivating noble character and great virtues, leading technological advancement, and building our motherland."
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of education, constantly accumulate cultural height, and gather spiritual strength. It is rich in content and has profound significance.
"海纳江河" emphasizes open-mindedness and inclusiveness, reflecting an attitude of "utilizing talents from all over the world" and drawing on high-quality concepts of education from prestigious institutions worldwide. "启真厚德" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and pursuing goodness, which means that universities should not only pursue truth, but also cultivate virtues and foster personality. "开物前民" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, including the pursuit of new knowledge, scientific research innovation, as well as reform and development. "树我邦国" emphasizes a spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always be closely aligned with the fate of the nation.
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuits is precisely the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
"The intelligent listen in silence and perceive before it takes shape."
Chinese universities should further establish themselves in the overall context of China's socialist cause with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the historical mission and era orientation of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to human care and independent freedom, let the spirit of the university interact with the spirit of the times and the national spirit, providing inexhaustible power to realize national prosperity and rejuvenation, and to achieve the common ideal of humanity.

"Guangxi University students can take a break for entrepreneurship for up to 5 years - Xinhua News Agency."
NANNING, May 19 (Xinhua) - According to the Education Department of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Chinese universities in Guangxi will implement a flexible education system, which will extend the leave of absence for college students who want to start their own businesses by 2 to 5 years on the basis of the original academic system. The period of leave of absence for entrepreneurship can be regarded as practical education time.
To enhance the entrepreneurial and innovative abilities of college students, various departments in Guangxi including education and human resources have jointly constructed entrepreneurial platforms, created more off-campus practical teaching bases, university science and technology parks, entrepreneurship parks, and incubation bases, thus providing external support for college students’ entrepreneurial endeavors.
According to the requirements, by 2020, the innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases in all universities should have an area of over 3000 square meters for undergraduate institutions and over 2000 square meters for vocational institutions.
The government encourages universities to establish credits for innovation and entrepreneurship, and gives priority to students who perform well in innovative and entrepreneurial practices to transfer majors.
University teachers are required to have at least two months of practical training in industrial enterprises every two years to improve their awareness and ability in innovation and entrepreneurial education.
The Education Department of the Autonomous Region requires that all universities in Guangxi deeply implement the program of innovation and entrepreneurship training for college students, striving to ensure that every college student participates in at least one innovation and entrepreneurship training program during their school years.
Colleges and universities should actively organize students to participate in various innovation and entrepreneurship competitions at all levels and provide financial support.
NEWS GOV-MO: Macau awards honorary doctoral degrees to seven outstanding individuals.
The University of Macau held its 2021 Honorary and Higher Degree Conferring Ceremony today (11th), awarding honorary doctorates from UM to Liu Zunyi, Chen Kaixian, Nakamura Shuji, Li Lanjuan, Li Xiaoliang, Zhu Lilan, and Jiang Zhaohui in recognition of their outstanding achievements and significant contributions to society and education.
At the awarding ceremony, the Chief Executive and Macau University's supervisor representative and Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, Ao Yangyu, awarded an honorary doctoral degree with the presence of Macau University's Board Chairman, Lin Jincheng, and President, Song Yonghua.
Professor Liu Zunyi was awarded an honorary doctorate in education, Professor Chen Kaixian was awarded an honorary doctorate in science, Professor Nakamura Shuji was awarded an honorary doctorate in science, Professor Li Lanjuan was awarded an honorary doctorate in science, Professor Li Xiaoliang was awarded an honorary doctorate in business administration, Professor Zhu Lilan was awarded an honorary doctorate in science, and Ms. Jiang Chaohui was awarded an honorary doctorate in science.
In his speech, Ouyang Yu first extended warm congratulations and profound respect to the seven outstanding individuals who received honorary doctorates, each of whom achieved extraordinary accomplishments in different fields and made outstanding contributions to the country's development and world progress. At the same time, Ouyang Yu expressed his sincerest wishes to the graduates and parents, as well as his heartfelt respect to the university's dedicated and academically excellent faculty team.
Professor Sun Yifeng, who gave a lecture at the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Macau, praised Professor Liu Zunyi, stating that he is a globally renowned economist known for his outstanding academic achievements and forward-thinking educational philosophy.
Apart from his achievements in economic development, economic growth, and leadership in the East Asian economy, he is also a visionary education leader.
In short, he has outstanding achievements in many fields.
Sun Yifeng announced during the praise of Nakamura Shuji that Professor Nakamura Shuji is a pioneer in sustainable energy technology.
He became one of the three Nobel laureates in physics in 2014 for inventing the blue light-emitting diode (LED).
Professor Nakamura's invention not only completely revolutionized the lighting industry but also contributed greatly to the well-being of humanity by spurring the production of white light-emitting diodes that are widely used in daily life and industrial production today.
Sun Yifeng read Li Lanjuan's praise and expressed that Professor Li Lanjuan, as a pioneer in China's artificial liver industry, created a unique and effective Li artificial liver system, which made significant breakthroughs in the treatment of severe hepatitis and liver failure, and significantly reduced the mortality rate of liver failure.
In the battle against COVID-19, her team's "four therapies and two balancing" plan, as well as the three technological advancements of artificial liver, microbiome, and stem cells that they brought, significantly increased the survival rate of critically ill patients.
When Sun Yifeng read the tribute to Li Xiaoliang, he stated that Professor Li Xiaoliang had laid the foundation for innovative research in operations management, shaped the thinking of supply chain theory and practice, and fundamentally changed business models around the world.

Finally, Chen Kai, as the representative of honorary doctorates, read the thank-you speech.
He is very happy to see that the pharmaceutical industry in Macau and the Greater Bay Area has set a good example: from the establishment of the first national key laboratory for traditional Chinese medicine quality research by the University of Macau to the flourishing development of traditional Chinese medicine in the Greater Bay Area, the University of Macau has played a huge role in integrating outstanding talents in the field of traditional Chinese medicine in the Greater Bay Area.
In addition, he thinks that the management team of the University of Macau has great vision and foresight, not only providing students with a fertile ground for scientific research academically, but also delivering a lot of responsible talents to society.
"He is honored to have the opportunity to exchange and cooperate with the University of Macau, and sincerely congratulates the university on its achievements in recent years."

At the time of NFT's rapid rise, the crypto community has come up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, where some residents who lost job opportunities due to the pandemic began to earn stable income through this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet development game based on blockchain technology, incorporating various gameplay including NFT. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume, and has exceeded 3 billion US dollars as of now."
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity's daily revenue has exceeded 8.2 million US dollars, approaching that of "King of Glory".
On August 6th this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active user count has exceeded one million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" is spreading a new "play-to-earn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer just a single role. In addition to enjoying the game and earning economic benefits from it, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game maker, but is ensured by blockchain technology.
After reading a piece of news about a friend's stock price, my biggest insight is about the choices companies make when it comes to investing in specific industries. Firstly, companies should choose industries with a large growth potential, with market sizes of at least 100 billion. Secondly, companies should choose industries that are expected to have good growth potential in the future, with the industry growth potential reaching an optimal state within the next 3-5 years. Lastly, companies should choose industries that receive policy support.
The width of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is smooth or rugged refers to the competition pattern of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the strategic layout for 2022.
The tactics lie in "doing things right", which means doing things correctly.
And strategy is about "doing the right thing," which means doing the right things.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics are about implementation. There is room for strategic thinking in most tactical considerations.
For example, when it comes to increasing the number of customers (tactical thinking), one can consider either continuing to deepen in the current field or expanding horizontally into new domains (strategic thinking). Similarly, when it comes to enhancing customer retention rates (tactical thinking), one can think about how to improve the retention rates for core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking). When it comes to increasing event participation (tactical thinking), one can consider setting the correct event KPI to achieve the correct event objectives, such as increasing the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and recruiting new customers. Finally, when it comes to increasing DAU (tactical thinking), one should evaluate the current growth to see whether it is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin welcomed several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7th, the small Central American country of El Salvador named Bitcoin as its legal tender, making it the first country or region to do so for Bitcoin.
On October 12th, for the first time in eight years, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares' Bitcoin ETF, which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. This marks the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to land on the US capital market, further expanding investment opportunities in cryptocurrency.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the main character.
On November 14th, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot". This upgrade improved the anonymity of transactions on the Bitcoin network and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the blocks themselves.

Thank you to all the staff who worked on our wedding photoshoot today. Looking forward to seeing the finished photos.
Taking wedding photos is simply a physical task, especially for the photographer who has to run and jump around.

Asian American groups file complaints of discriminatory admissions practices against Yale and three other Ivy League schools - Xinhua News Agency.
Washington, May 23 (Xinhua) - More than 130 Asian-American groups submitted complaints to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23, protesting against Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College for discriminating against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which spearheaded the appeal, held a press conference in Washington D.C. on that day.
The chairman of the organization, Zhao Yukong, said at a press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of prestigious American universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three prestigious American universities has remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities practice "long-term, systemic discrimination against Asian American applicants" in their so-called "holistic" admissions process.
Zhao Yukong introduced that in 2014, research by scholars such as Sanders showed that among these three universities, the admission rate for Asians was the lowest among all ethnic groups in proportion to the number of applicants.
Data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all the Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian-American students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope that after submitting the appeal, the US Department of Education and Department of Justice can launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after determining the facts.
They also hope that the complained universities can take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies towards Asians.
Currently, the three universities that were complained about have not responded yet.
The Asian American Educational Alliance was established in 2015. At that time, it had complained about Harvard University's discriminatory admissions practices, but the US Department of Education did not accept the complaint due to procedural reasons.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, the education groups participating in the appeal also include Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American groups in the United States.
Need tableware.
Just cancelled the order.
Why is it still in progress?
Can you help me check if there is any cancellation?
But I placed the order at 5:09 in the morning.
"That is the food ordering hotline, they don't know anything,"
Is there a phone number that I can directly contact them with?
In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a real estate agent. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu had a discussion with Lin, the relative of the property owner, regarding the details of purchasing the factory, and on the same day, he transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit through bank transfer.
Mr. Lin signed as the payee on the "Receipt for Factory Purchase Deposit" which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will go to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice, and both parties agree to sign the factory purchase contract within one week."
However, afterwards both parties failed to reach a consensus on the main contract terms such as the scope of factory sale and payment methods, which resulted in a delay in signing the house sale and purchase contract.
Considering that both parties failed to reach a consensus regarding the contract terms, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned a deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu.
After finding a house that he finally fell in love with, Mr. Lu paid the deposit and prepared the payment for the house. All that was left was to sign the contract, but the seller suddenly decided not to sell, leaving Mr. Lu feeling helpless and angry.
Therefore, Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to the Yuyao People's Court.
After review, the court believes that the failure to sign a formal contract is not solely the responsibility of the defendant, and should be reasonably presumed as a failure to negotiate a deal. Therefore, the penalty for breach of contract by returning double the deposit should not apply in this case, and the defendant is not obligated to bear this responsibility.
After the first trial verdict, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the second instance court upheld the original verdict.
[Lawyer's reminder] It is necessary to exercise due diligence and attention during the transaction process.
When signing a contract, as a buyer, you should exercise necessary caution and attention to details. For example, verify the information of the property owner and whether the property is occupied, and clearly specify the specific time and place for delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between both parties in the fulfillment of the contract.
After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, the spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry made a statement on Saturday (December 11th) stating that the United States' hosting of the "Leaders' Summit for Democracy" is "ideologically divisive and weaponizes democracy as a tool. It's a false democracy that incites division and confrontation and seeks to shift domestic contradictions." (Translated from German Voice Chinese website)
The Chinese government believes that for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, promoted "democratic transformation", imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated "color revolutions", which have led to disastrous consequences.
"Democracy" has long become the "weapons of mass destruction" for the United States to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action for Biden to fulfill his campaign commitment.
The two-day conference was conducted via video, and 111 global leaders from around the world were invited to attend, including the leader of Taiwan. However, China and Russia were not among the invitees.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its democracy problems and claimed that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of skepticism both internationally and domestically in the United States. For example, some criticized the invitation of leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as those from countries like the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some people doubt that the true intention of the Biden administration in organizing this summit is not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
Newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the online Democracy Summit.
Saturday's statement from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that "today's American-style democracy has fully displayed its pathology, with issues such as money politics, identity politics, party polarization, social division, racial conflict, and wealth inequality becoming increasingly prominent." American democracy is said to be a "game for the wealthy" built upon a foundation of capital.
US President Biden said in his speech, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the protective barrier of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, better resist the buffering and impact of authoritarianism, and those who pursue power nakedly before the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not a given, "we must constantly renew it in every generation, and in my view, this is the decisive challenge of our era."
Biden also said, "At a time when global democracy and human rights face continuous and alarming challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The United States has promised to launch a one-year action plan worth $424.4 million after this democratic summit to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific and public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the physical democracy summit planned for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let all of our countries fulfill our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year."
Okay, I'm worried he might send the wrong address.
Richsun Restaurant (Wudaokou Branch)
[Peppermint] Environment: Average. [Service Bell] Service: Food is served quickly. "Ancient Method Ma La Cake" is a must-try dish for me. Ma La Cake is too fragrant, soft, and delicious 😋. If you love desserts, you must try "Dongjiang Squid Stuffed Tofu Hotpot." The soup is very delicious, the tofu is very tender, and the squid...
Great taste, good quality meat, and friendly service.
I haven't been to Richang for a long time, but the fruit smoothies are still so delicious and full of quality ingredients. The first time I tried the barbecue pork buns, they had the soft wheat flavor of Southern cuisine that I love!
The clay pot rice is perfectly cooked, with just the right amount of moisture, and the serving size is very generous. The signature tin foil chicken wings are as good as always, and the soup is also not bad. The Chinese broccoli is also well-prepared.
Great taste, friendly service, and good quality meat.
Ri Chang Old Shop was also a popular place on the internet many years ago. It is a small building in Dongdan with wooden floors.
The clay pots used for the baozai rice that always takes a long time to eat at the entrance have all cracked.
I haven't been to Richang restaurant in several years, as the rise of various small Cantonese restaurants has dispersed the customer flow.
Rare to find a seat as soon as you arrive at the restaurant, the quality of the dishes is beyond words, as good as always.
Taste is great, the meat is good, and the staple food is great.
Ri Chang takeout.
[Rice] Meal: The dishes this time were a little disappointing.
Three-cup chicken: there's a bit too much side dish, and the chicken is slightly less in quantity.
"The taste that was adjusted is a bit off. The base flavor is not salty enough, so the sweet taste stands out. Everyone can imagine the combination of sweet and various spices as a side dish..."
What is the drinking method for red label whiskey?
Everyone has different hobbies. Some people enjoy collecting things, some enjoy food, and of course, some enjoy wine. Red Label whisky is one of the best-selling Scottish whiskies in the world, and it has won a gold medal at an international liquor competition.
Each bottle of Red Label whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don’t know how to savor it, isn't it a waste of its richness and fragrance?
So how do you drink red label whiskey?
The author will give you a brief introduction.
Red label whiskey drinking method:
The Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is blended from about 35 different Scottish whiskies, and has a strong aroma and traditional Scottish whisky characteristics, with a rich and sweet, smoky taste.
The taste is rich and refreshing with a slight hint of herbs and a strong smoky malt flavor at the entrance.
This wine can be added with ice and consumed directly, or mixed with your favorite drinks for consumption.
Red label whiskey has entered the country, and in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, mixing red label whiskey with Coca-Cola, Sprite, or other carbonated drinks such as Fanta has become a timeless fashion.
These sweet beverages not only serve to balance out the acidity, but also bring visual pleasure, and when added to alcoholic drinks, they have the effect of diluting the flavor and changing the mouthfeel.
Red label whisky + sliced lemon + sugar (can also use sugar), is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
The authentic Hongfangwei has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize the acidity, and lemon can bring a fresh aroma to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.
The above three methods are the best ways to drink red label whiskey. You can try them as reference, and I hope my introduction can help you.
Educational Thinking: How to Allow "Top Students" and "Underperforming Students" to Achieve Their Best in University Exams - Xinhua Net.
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders expressing their confusion about university exams and suggesting to increase the difficulty level of exams, change the exam question types, and fulfill the demand for exams to truly reflect students' practical abilities.
Indeed, for a long time, college entrance exams have been a hot topic.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world with varying abilities and different levels of learning, so their study situations can vary greatly.
Assessing a group with such diverse characteristics can inevitably lead to different feelings.
Of course, if the exam questions have a single and repetitive format, and if the questions are too simple, it will inevitably create a completely different feeling.
Students who are not diligent may pass the exam by concentrating on last minute study, but if they try other methods, they could achieve better results with less effort.
In this way, the phenomenon of "learning losers" who don't put in much effort but still pass or even score high, and "learning gods" who never miss a class, are great at homework and note-taking, but only perform marginally better in exams, appears.
From this perspective, the concerns raised by the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University about the problems in university exams are not unfounded, and I believe this situation is not unique to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
From this perspective, we should give a thumbs up to the three students who wrote the letter straightforwardly.
In fact, those who have attended college all know that the phenomenon of cramming for exams, attempting to extract exam questions from teachers through various means, trying to narrow down the scope of the exam, and seeking "key guidance" before exams is not uncommon. Even the situation of using cheat sheets during exams and asking teachers to be lenient after exams is not unheard of.
In the opinion of the author, as a guide for evaluating teaching quality, measuring the success or failure of a university exam depends more on the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as the scientific proposition based on this foundation.
Entering the undergraduate stage of university, majors begin to subdivide, and many courses focus on fundamental knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether one has a comprehensive understanding of the basic knowledge points of a subject is what college exams aim to test.
As for undergraduate knowledge, it mainly consists of subject foundational theories and basic common knowledge. In terms of knowledge points, there is not much room for variation, as it is mostly fixed.
As a teacher once said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics learned in university 20 years ago is still being taught and remains essential."
But the fact that the subject matter remains fundamentally unchanged does not mean that the examination question types are singular, and the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, exams are usually made up by the examination group, which is then organized by senior subject teachers to form the test paper. The examination grading is also participated by all teachers who are responsible for that subject, so as to overcome the problem of repeated questions to a certain extent.
However, in order to create a set of test questions that are in line with the practicalities of teaching and learning, the difficulty of the questions should follow a normal distribution based on students' overall learning situation. It is also necessary to comprehensively understand the teaching situation and analyze students' learning level, so that the test questions can dynamically grasp the level of difficulty and types of questions. The test questions should not only emphasize the examination of foundational knowledge, but also take into account the examination of students' abilities. At the same time, innovative design should be applied to the types of questions.
Examination is the baton of university education. Students will have corresponding preparation plans according to the type of examination. Over time, this will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Regarding the students' recommendation letter, the leadership of Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it and has already deployed a plan for improvement throughout the entire university.
Each teaching unit is required to organize teachers to conduct seminars and compare the final course exams with self-inspection, formulate examination paper propositions and related regulations, while strengthening supervision and inspection of the examination paper proposition and review process, refining the assessment of results, and strengthening comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
Addressing issues such as the lack of diversity in exam types and repeated questions is a topic that university exam administration must face from a systemic perspective. While implementing corresponding regulations is necessary, the key lies in daily efforts, as teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of teaching situations. Teachers not only need to fully comprehend the content being taught, but also the learning situation of their students. With such comprehensive understanding, teaching and learning can be better aligned, forming a positive interaction, and leading to exams that better reflect reality. This will allow "top students" and "struggling students" to each receive what they deserve.
If it is not possible to change the store location for me, can we switch to delivery instead?

Madame Jin's Wedding Photography (Nanjie Store) currently has no branch stores.
Before taking the photos, because we didn't schedule the time well, we changed the time twice. Consultant Lanlan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, they chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos.
"Madam Jin's staff, whether they are consultants, makeup artists, or photographers, are all great."
That was the first time in my life that I officially put on makeup. Wow~ I couldn't believe it, one day I could become so good-looking, haha.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry, I can't remember her name) have great patience in doing makeup, and the makeup they do looks very natural.
The outdoor scene was filmed in Jiangwan City. Luckily, the weather was good that day and I didn't feel too cold. During the photoshoot, the make-up artist kept an eye on our clothes and accessories, and would immediately help us tidy up if something was slightly amiss.
The photographer is also very humorous and feels happy after taking photos all day.
When selecting photos, because we saw many examples online, we didn't want to have the client delete too many photos. However, when we were selecting photos, the package included only 24 photos, and we didn't have the intention to add any more. (I heard that my cousin, who took wedding photos around the same time as me, added over 10,000 photos in a package worth over 7,000. I was shocked and worried that I would select too many photos.)
Today, the photos were edited and Lanlan sent them to me. I looked at them and found two that were not very good. They immediately helped me re-edit them.
Comparing the photos my younger sister took in the past, I feel very satisfied with our photos. They are simple and fresh, exactly the style I wanted.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Jin Furen for their wedding photos!
Package Price: 3999 yuan.
Madam Jin is grateful for your sincere well wishes and wishes you all a happy and fulfilling future, with bright prospects ahead!

Your name is Zheng Mian, and this is your second week of moving to Japan.
You were walking on the street when suddenly you noticed someone was following you. You got scared and started walking faster, and eventually you started running.
The person behind you chased after you and said in Japanese, "Miss, please wait!" You stopped your steps at the entrance of a convenience store.
"Miss...I am a director. I think you are very beautiful. Are you interested in participating in a reality show?"
You are very confused and afraid that this may be a scam.

3200 newborn babies in Sabah have no birth certificate due to shortage of custom anti-counterfeit paper.
(Kota Kinabalu, 11th October) The Sabah National Registration Department stated that due to the depletion of stocks of special anti-counterfeit paper, they have been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since early October. As a result, the number of affected individuals has accumulated to 3,200 people as of now.
However, Director Kaluaminus assures that all the information for the babies who have already applied for birth certificates has been recorded in the system, and they will be issued once the security paper arrives next week.
He made an explanation at a press conference regarding a report from an online media outlet that highlighted the issue of Sabah newspaper's paper printing problem, which persisted for 10 months.
He said that the issue had appeared two months ago and Sarawak was also facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeit paper have been affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed delivery to our country."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used for Sabah identity cards is different from other regions, so it is not possible to borrow stocks from other states.
Kailu Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper has been transported to Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
"The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday and immediately proceed with the final stage of printing upon returning to Sabah. It is estimated that it will take an additional 2 working days (December 20th) to hand over to the applicant."
"We will notify applicants to go to local branches to collect their birth certificates."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
"From a little after 7 o'clock until now."
Does that mean it's almost here?
"I mean food."
I am waiting opposite #PRS_ORG# again.
Okay, thank you. The restaurant said that it is ready.
People's Daily commentator: "14th Five-Year Plan" realizes a good start --- on learning and implementing the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11: People's Daily commentator article on December 12 - "A Good Start to the 14th Five-Year Plan" - on learning and implementing the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference.
"A good start has been achieved for the 14th Five-Year Plan." The Central Economic Work Conference held from December 8th to 10th highly evaluated the achievements of China's economic and social development over the past year.
General Secretary Xi Jinping made an important speech at the meeting, profoundly summarizing the economic work of 2021, conducting a comprehensive analysis of the current economic situation, making major deployments for the economic work of 2022, and providing fundamental guidance for us to do well in next year's economic work and welcome the successful convening of the 20th National Congress of the Party, pointing out the direction forward and providing a fundamental follow-up.
We are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, officially announcing the comprehensive completion of a moderately prosperous society and the achievement of the first centenary goal, opening a new journey towards the second centenary goal of building a socialist modernized country comprehensively.
We held the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to summarize the significant achievements and historical experience of the Party's century-long struggle. Through the third historical resolution in the Party's century-long history, the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Major Achievements and Historical Experience of the Party's Century-long Struggle," this is a political declaration for the Communist Party of China to remember its original mission, insist on and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. It is a guide for action to draw lessons from history, create the future, and achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Over the past year, the world has experienced unprecedented changes and the global pandemic of COVID-19 has had a profound impact, creating a complex and challenging external environment. Domestically, the tasks of preventing and controlling COVID-19 and promoting economic and social development have been extremely arduous and difficult.
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core insists on coordinating both the domestic and international situations, adhering to the general principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability, calmly dealing with the century-long change and the pandemic crisis, integrating epidemic prevention and control with economic and social development, accelerating the establishment of a new development pattern, strengthening the macroeconomic policy to regulate across cycles, focusing on promoting sustained and healthy economic development, and deepening reform, opening up and innovation. The Party and the state have achieved significant new accomplishments in various undertakings despite arduous tasks of development and reform.
The "14th Five-Year Plan" has achieved a good start, and an important aspect is reflected in taking new steps to build a new development pattern, and achieving new results in high-quality development.
Our country continues to maintain a leading position in economic development and epidemic prevention and control, showing strong resilience, great potential, and sufficient momentum; the national strategic scientific and technological strength is accelerating and major innovation achievements are emerging, with sustained improvement in scientific and technological innovation capabilities and new breakthroughs in key core technology research; the industrial chain is becoming more resilient, foreign trade volume and quality are increasing, and the structure continues to optimize, with new dynamics represented by new industries, new formats, and new models growing and expanding; reform and opening up are being pushed forward in depth, focusing on removing bottlenecks that hinder the matching of supply and demand and factor mobility, and creating new advantages for cooperation and competition through high-level opening up; people's livelihoods are effectively guaranteed, employment continues to grow in scale, residents' income growth is basically synchronized with economic growth, and annual grain production has exceeded 13 trillion jin for 7 consecutive years, achieving the "18th consecutive bumper harvest"; the construction of ecological civilization continues to advance, with comprehensive promotion of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, steady progress in green and low-carbon transformation, and new achievements in ecological environment protection.
The achievement of these results is the outcome of the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and the concerted efforts and hard work of the whole Party, people of all ethnic groups in the country.
Practice once again proves that the Party's establishment of Comrade Xi Jinping as the core of the Party Central Committee and the core of the whole party, and the establishment of the guidance position of Xi Jinping's new era of socialist ideology with Chinese characteristics, is of decisive significance for the development of the party and the state in the new era and for promoting the historical process of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

Super convenient, just like opening on a computer, it solves my problem of insufficient hard drive space on my computer.
Just arrived today, the brand new solid-state mobile hard drive cannot be read by the computer, and the computer does not recognize it, but it can be read with a USB drive.
The machine is easy to operate and has a stylish and beautiful appearance.
Today I used it for the whole afternoon. The heat dissipation is very good, and I basically don't feel hot. The operating speed is very fast, and it boots up quicker than 99% of users.
The battery is also very strong, with a standby time of 9 hours and should have no problem being used for 4 hours. In general, I feel very happy that at this price, I can buy such a high-quality machine. Other functions will be added later as they are discovered.
The appearance is very good.
In terms of performance, evaluate again after using it for a period of time.
The machine is fast, bigger than expected, and the rendering is excellent. I'm happy with it. I'll write a follow-up review after using it for some time.
Not bad, not bad. The serial number of this machine can be found on Hong Kong's database, so the quality should be okay.
The feeling is not about size, it's about weight. It's not actually that big that one hand cannot hold it, it's just a bit bigger than 15.6 inches. It runs very stably and smoothly, and I don't feel any lag. I love the sound of the fan for cooling, very refreshing, and it doesn't constantly run like a gaming laptop.
"The stuff is good, much cheaper than the official flagship store, and they even gave me a backpack. I think it's pretty good."
The service provided by the store was also good. They reminded me to update my BIOS and promptly issued a **.
Worth it!
Cooling effect: Excellent cooling, basically no heat. Portability: Convenient to carry. Appearance and material: Traditional Thinkpad design, satisfying.
The seller has good reputation and carefully inspects the appearance and all interfaces of the machine. There are no traces of refurbishment or previous use. It is indeed a brand new American version machine with the same configuration as advertised on the webpage.
Forgot to send the backpack, and immediately helped me reissue one. Although it was not the original factory backpack, the follow-up service proved that they are a conscientious seller.
If friends need to buy a laptop, buy it again.
Appearance Material: The appearance is atmospheric. Display Effect: The screen resolution is good, clear. Lightness: It has a good sense of quality as it is heavier.
Cooling effect: Tried it out initially, will evaluate again later.
Typing on the keyboard is quite good, and it also comes with a mouse and a converter. In comparison to those sold in the domestic market, this configuration is still very cost-effective. Overall, it is a good value for the price. As for machine performance, I will give an evaluation after using it for a period of time.
This screen is really comfortable!
"Smooth to use, will add a further review after using it for some time!"
Education news: Beijing tightens the proportion of middle school students with special talents enrolled in 2016 - Xinhuanet.
On the 21st and 22nd, the selection process for middle school students with special talents in Beijing was carried out by the education commissions of each district.
This year, all districts in Beijing have reduced the proportion of special talents in enrollment, making the competition more intense for these students.
Taking Dongcheng District as an example, this year, the proportion of special students admitted from primary to secondary schools in the district should not exceed 5% of the total enrollment plan for the entire district. The planned enrollment is 380 students, and the enrollment ratio should not exceed 10% of the school's enrollment plan.
All students who have talents in sports, arts, and science and technology and have registered online are eligible to participate in the selective recruitment examination for talented students.
For the convenience of students to participate in examinations nearby, Dongcheng District continues the examination arrangement method from last year, setting up 1-2 examination sites in each school district, with a total of 13 examination sites.
The exam sites are divided into exam rooms based on the exam regions, and are divided into time slots in hours. On the day of the exam, students will enter the exam sites during their designated time slots to take the exam in different exam rooms of the respective exam regions.
On May 23rd, the district education enrollment examination center published online the list of students who have passed the examination. Students can check the examination results online.
Can it be delivered within 10 to 15 minutes?
Did not receive food.
The key issue is that I haven't eaten dinner tonight.
If it can't be delivered, you can tell me early, okay?
Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee President: Confident that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics in exceptional times - Xinhua News Agency.
Sarajevo, December 11 (Xinhua) - The Chairman of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Krešimir Čosić, recently stated that Bosnia and Herzegovina is eagerly looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and firmly believes that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympic Games in these special times.
Recently, Chinese Ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina Ji Ping met with President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee Cvijanović.
During the meeting, Krzysztof Kwiecień spoke highly of the relationship between Poland and China. He mentioned that he visited China during the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and was deeply impressed with the excellent organization of the event by China. He firmly believes that China has the ability to hold a successful Winter Olympics during this special period. Poland is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics, and the Polish Olympic Committee is actively organizing their participation. Poland hopes that this will be an opportunity to conduct more extensive exchange and cooperation with China in the field of sports.
Jiping expressed that there is a special "Olympic bond" between China and Poland.
The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics was successfully held here, and in two months, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also begin, presenting a simple, safe, and wonderful event to the world.
Looking forward to the deepening of exchange and cooperation between the two countries in the preparation for winter sports events and athlete training. The Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue playing a bridging role in promoting the continuous deepening of people-to-people exchanges between the two countries, taking the opportunity of the Beijing Winter Olympics. Letting the two countries' people "move forward into the future" and wishing the Bosnian athletes success in Beijing.
Before the meeting, the Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina held the "10th Annual Best Athlete" awards ceremony, where Qi Ping was invited as a special guest to present the award for the best young athlete in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The promotional video of Beijing Winter Olympics is being played on loop at the event.

"State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issues requirements to strengthen epidemic prevention and control in port cities by setting up a "buffer zone" and requiring a negative nucleic acid test within 48 hours - Xinhua News."
Beijing, December 11 (Xinhua) - The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of COVID-19 in port cities. It requires that people who leave land border port cities (except for those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) must hold negative nucleic acid test results within 48 hours. People who arrive at land border port cities must undergo at least one nucleic acid test.
According to the notice, the time range for the above request is from the day when each province, region or city determines the range of port cities and announces it, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that port cities with conditions can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
The person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health Commission introduced that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and there is frequent cross-border travel between the two sides.
Implement differential management policies for different regions, transforming from a single line of defense against external outbreaks to two lines of defense. It's expected to move the first line of defense forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve maximal effectiveness in epidemic prevention and control with minimal social impact and lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been several local outbreaks of COVID-19 in our country, all of which were caused by imported cases through port cities.
The above notice points out that there are issues such as untimely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some areas, lack of implementation in the closed-loop management of high-risk job positions, routine nucleic acid testing being just a formality, inadequate disinfection measures in various links of cold chain items, non-standard management of centralized isolation sites, and insufficiently scientific and precise handling of epidemic emergencies.
According to the notification requirements, efforts should be made in nine aspects, such as improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, establishing a sound epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures. We should accelerate the remediation of weaknesses in the port city prevention and control system, and redouble our efforts to do a good job in prevention and control in a scientific and accurate manner, and weave a tight defense line against external inputs.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should synchronize research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control with guaranteeing the livelihood of the people, publicize and keep open the hotline for livelihood security, regularly investigate potential hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic life materials, and timely solve and proactively respond to prominent issues reflected by the public.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, and banners) where open land, water and air ports are located, as well as the cities (prefectures, leagues) and the municipalities where they are located. The specific scope is determined and timely announced by each province (autonomous region, municipality) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

"Oil Pipeline Video Exposes 20 Year Bloodthirsty Killing Truth of the US Army - Xinhua News"
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the war in Afghanistan under the name of "anti-terrorism," forcefully exporting American-style democracy through the war, 20 years of poverty, violence, bloodthirstiness, and indiscriminate killings, committing various crimes against humanity.
Abusing drones to carry out air strikes on civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distorts human nature and establish killer groups.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Afghanistan.
The US military established "black prisons" to inflict various tortures and indignities upon "suspects."
One by one, the crimes against humanity have stirred up more hatred among the people of Afghanistan.
As the video states, the American "war on terror" has become "more terrifying the more it is fought."
War has not brought peace, democracy, prosperity and hope to the Afghan people. It has only brought a country full of devastation and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video, let's together reveal the truth behind the bloodthirsty killings that the United States carries out under the guise of "counterterrorism," and expose the hypocrisy of American-style democracy.
Accidentally came across the following article which discusses from both a business perspective and a preservation perspective why a customer would want a logistics company in the bonded zone to assist in canning, although canning is considered deep processing and not within the business scope of the bonded logistics company. This article may provide an explanation for why the customer wants to do this.
I have visited many infant formula manufacturers and have been exposed to many production lines of infant formula.
Actually, the raw materials for packaged and canned milk powder are exactly the same, without any difference.
So everyone must be wondering: Why is the shelf life of bagged products one year, while the shelf life of canned products is two years or longer?
Or, another question could be asked: why is there such a big price difference between canned and bagged products?
Actually, many consumers, or mothers, start from this point and think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, it's just that everyone thinks that the expensive one is better.
Some consumers also eat with this mentality and react by saying that the taste or flavor of the packaged food is different!
Now let me first explain to everyone why the price of bottled drinks is expensive, and where the high price comes from.
Why is there such a big price difference when the raw materials are the same for them?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the price of bagged goods is too high, it will be difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low or non-existent. So, what can the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they have had a significant increase in pricing for their canned goods to ensure their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers promote canned products, rather than bagged ones.
Also, why do you think those manufacturers spend tens of millions or even billions on advertising every year? Where does that expense come from?
Everyone can imagine/Everyone can understand.
So, with the development of society, the promotional costs of the market, such as: the promotion personnel in the shopping mall, the display expenses in the shopping mall, the gift costs of the products, advertising costs, and so on, are also increasing continuously.
Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly introducing new products, which are also available in canned packaging, and their prices are continuously rising. In fact, this is due to the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the cost increase of their raw materials is not more than 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There is another group of brands that, in order to promote their products by any means necessary, collaborate with doctors in hospitals to help promote their products, earning profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per listen.
And the relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such methods of operation. In fact, this kind of practice is harming consumers.
It is suggested that everyone buy milk powder in bulk packaging and transfer it into a canister at home. This can save costs and improve the storage and sealing of the milk powder, without any negative impact on children.
Also, everyone should not think that the shelf life of canned goods is longer than that of bagged goods. If the shelf life of canned and bagged goods is the same after opening the package, it is just that bagged goods are not easy to store and are prone to moisture and deterioration after opening.
The delivery was late, the food became cold, and after becoming cold it became dry and hard, making it totally impossible to eat.
Moreover, the soup broth spilled out as well.
"Cancel immediately, everything that #PRS_ORG# sent as compensation must have gone cold by now."
I didn't take it!
#NAME# said that none of you went to get it.
We made a phone call.
"If you don't refund me, I will report it to the police."
I have used #PRS_ORG# several times, but today's experience was the worst.
Completely unacceptable.
Okay, no problem.
But also need to remind restaurants and delivery drivers.
Avoid it from happening again next time.
I want to know the exact delivery time.
That time kept delaying.
I don't know how long I have to wait.
If I cancel the order, can I get a refund?
How can I pay the service fee to the rider?
One rider was confirmed over an hour ago.
I don't want to wait anymore.
Don't let people be scared at the starting line - Xinhua News.
When strolling through the book market, one can often feel the popularity of success-oriented books.
The current success-oriented books often promote the "best principle," which means assuming or implying that you can "do it" first, and then telling you what needs to be done.
It's like jumping over the most important and fundamental part, which is "how to do it".
As a result, these books all have a common characteristic - either they work hard to do their best or they don't do anything at all; either they are 100 or 0; either you climb Mount Tai or you just stay where you are.
This "best principle" is recognized as "extremely correct" by anyone who sees it, but 99% of people will be frightened and intimidated before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates for a path of "you need to make a painful decision, become a new person, and go through a 180-degree transformation," and this happens to be the fatal weakness for many people.
For someone who sticks to old rules, is conservative and resists change, shouting in their ear to "change" is undoubtedly a futile and meaningless endeavor.
The vast majority of people are frightened by the word "change" and hesitate to move forward, finding it difficult to make a decision. Alternatively, some may impulsively decide to make a change and courageously take the first step, but often this does not last long and they quickly give up, struggling to maintain continuity.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross-talk "Starting from Tomorrow" vividly expresses this classic narrative of "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people, causing the vast majority of people to "sigh with regret at the door".
Perhaps, the "second best principle" is a way that may enable more ordinary people to embark on a path to relative success.
The core of the "second best principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories into big ones," which means that if you can't achieve 100, doing just 1 is still worthwhile: because 1 is always better than 0. If you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing a small sand dune outside your house is also good because it's always better than standing still.
In short, as long as you have done something, it is always better than doing nothing.
Due to the significant reduction of the threshold, there is now a greater possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as they persist, the probability of success will also increase.
Just following the "second best principle" to the path of success, the journey may be slightly longer.
In summary, although the "best principle" may claim to promote success for everyone on the surface, in reality it can only inspire a few. The "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.
So, do I need to place a new order now?
Phone is not answered.
Continual delays.
It hasn't been delivered yet.
May I ask, when will it be delivered?
How can we get in touch?
Please cancel the order.
"I can't wait any longer, thank you."
He missed two meals to deliver, but one order has been completed.
I would like to ask how to contact the rider.
Just now, the first rider told me that there should be another rider who will make the delivery.
The resource reserve of naked carps in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua News.
XINHUA News Agency, Xining, December 11th (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) - According to the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, the latest monitoring results show that the resource reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons, which is more than 40 times the cumulative growth compared to the initial protection stage in 2002.
The naked carp, commonly known as "Huang fish", is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, and plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological security and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" food chain within the Qinghai Lake basin.
During the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as excessive hunting, the degradation of aquatic environments for naked carps, the quantity decreased sharply. In 2002, the resource reserve of naked carps in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the "Red List of China's Species".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, organization, or individual from fishing naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, by artificial breeding and release as well as cleaning the main river channels that flow into Qinghai Lake and designing scientifically reasonable "fish passageway" measures, efforts to protect the lake have continued to increase. As a result, the reserve of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has increased year by year.
Yang Lin, the Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million artificial breeding and release of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has been carried out, and the contribution rate to the recovery of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake exceeds 23%.
The Three Rivers Source Area in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of western desertification to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and the Qinghai Lake water areas, and to protect aquatic wildlife and maintain biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued notices to ban fishing in key water areas of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and has established a comprehensive fishing ban management system for "one river, one lake, and one river".

The restaurant only gave me one bag to put the food in, and it's cold outside.
I want to ask, is the take-out packaged in a bag?
We only see one bag.
I want to know whether it was missed or someone took it away. Thanks.
It has already been 1 hour, and it still hasn't been delivered.
I just read an article about menstruation, and it was too long.
Give a science popularization to males who do not know.
Most girls will experience their first menstrual period suddenly between the ages of 13-15, and will stop menstruating around the age of 50.
Afterwards and under the premise of a healthy body, it will come once every month regularly.
But it's not regular enough to predict accurately. The margin of error is about a week. Preparation needs to be done in advance, and sometimes unexpected things can still happen (like suddenly moving things ahead by several days if luck is not good).
The length of time, amount of blood, and degree of menstrual pain vary from person to person. Some people experience it for three days, while others for a week. The amount of blood flow can also vary, with some having light flow and others experiencing heavy bleeding. Some may have little to no reaction, while others may experience such severe pain that they need to be taken away in an ambulance. Menstrual pain can change over time and just because someone didn't experience pain in the past, it doesn't mean that they won't experience it in the future.
The menstrual period cannot be controlled, and there is bleeding for 24 hours a day during the days from start to end. The only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to prevent the blood from flowing onto clothes or chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen promptly at the beginning of the physiological period before the onset of dysmenorrhea can effectively relieve monthly pain. It is not very helpful to take ibuprofen after the onset of dysmenorrhea.
Before menstruation, due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If you experience a sudden stomachache around the expected time of your menstrual cycle, it is likely that you will have your period within the next two days.
It's best to replace sanitary pads every two to three hours, otherwise it's easy to breed bacteria. Except for sleeping time, the worst case is to replace it six times a day, which is 42 pads in seven days of a month. If you add some prepared ones, it may be around 50 pads, but not necessarily using one every month.
(Revise this a bit, sanitary pads don't need to be changed frequently, approximately every five to six hours is enough, with the longest time being eight hours.)
During menstruation, hormonal changes may cause irritability, and during ovulation, unstable emotions can occur due to changes in hormones in the body, which is very unlucky and can trip up the body itself.
However, official crime rate data shows that women have a high ability to control their emotions and will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
What is flowing is not just blood; it also contains shed uterine lining.
After the end of menstruation, the endometrium (lining) of the uterus is thinnest, and then slowly thickens. This can be understood as the uterus being a house, and every month it builds a new house (thickening of the lining) to prepare for guests. If the guests do not come, the house is demolished (menstruation) and a new house is built next month, repeating the cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for several decades every month for several days, there is continuous bleeding for 24 hours, and there may be abdominal and back pain. Who would want this?
However, people are born because their mother has had their menstrual cycle. Menstruation is to prepare the house where you will stay for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should be thankful for their mother's regular and healthy menstrual cycle.
In the past, many things related to women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women into thinking that they were dirty and shameful. Everyone believed it was like that, but times have changed.
If someone finds menstruation nauseating, thinks that the female body preparing for childbirth is disgusting, and should not be spoken of in public, girls should stand up and not think this way. Men who have never experienced or don't have much understanding of it shouldn't be ungrateful and ignorant. How could they have the face to face their own mothers with such an attitude? How could they want their own children with such a mentality?
Finally, sisters, try using a menstrual tampon, it's really effective.
Today is the Winter Solstice festival. Sending the wrong thing can be quite disappointing.
Order separate meals for the children to eat.
Hope that the store will check the products even in the midst of a busy schedule.
Is it an electric shock if my feet feel numb while soaking in a foot bath?
Choosing the right foot bath tub can have a good therapeutic and health effect on your feet. Today, the Guomei editor will provide answers to this issue and hopes to be helpful to friends.
With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot baths are becoming increasingly popular among consumers, and a wide range of products with different grades are emerging on the market, ranging from foot baths that cost a little over a hundred yuan to those that cost thousands of yuan. This provides consumers with plenty of choices.
On the relevant data surface, compared with traditional household appliances, sales of health-care appliances such as foot baths are booming. However, foot baths do not have specific industry standards, therefore, there are certain safety risks.
"It's really too dangerous to soak your feet in water that is charged with electricity!"
Mr. Li told the reporter that recently he bought a foot bath tub as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness in the soles of his feet while soaking them.
Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused it, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness in his feet.
Mr. Li used an electric pen to test it and was surprised to find that the water in the footbath was electrified because the electric pen shone brightly.
Later, he contacted the merchant whose attitude was alright. Even though the footbath was returned, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that this long-popular foot bath now lacks a clear and detailed industry regulation in terms of the maximum temperature setting, applicable population, and materials that ensure safety.
But generally speaking, foot bath tubs will not have electrical problems, but there are also some products that may not have been strictly inspected during the manufacturing process.
Therefore, when purchasing, choose a split-style foot bath.
Hydroelectric separation, there is no safety hazard.
At the same time, you can freely use the electrical pen to measure.
The 13th Provincial Tea Fair is opened - Headline Perspective - Hunan Daily News Net - Huasheng Online.
On December 10th, according to Hunan Daily News (reporters Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, correspondent Liu Xiaoling, photography by Li Jian), this morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Expo and XinHua Black Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center to showcase the tea industry, innovate tea technology, promote tea culture, and accelerate the goal of achieving a billion yuan tea industry.
Hou Shunli, deputy director of the Council of China National Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation, and Ye Hongzhuan, deputy director of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced with great enthusiasm at the opening ceremony that the source of Hu Hong tea is in Xinhua, and the rise of red tea has injected new energy into the "colorful Xiang tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and the provincial government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoting the construction of a billion-dollar tea industry in Hunan and forming a development pattern of "Three Xiang, Four Rivers, and Five Colored Tea".
Within the province, the tea industry is enhancing innovation, with major tea types such as green tea, black tea, and red tea taking turns to make advances. The main tea-producing areas are promoting the integration of tea and tourism to stimulate an increase in income for tea farmers.
Fortunes alternate, and red tea gains momentum again.
According to tea experts within the province, after harvesting green tea, if tea farmers also harvest red tea and black tea, they can have income throughout the year and increase the output value of tea gardens.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded licenses to the fourth batch of companies authorized to use the trademark "Hunan Red Tea," and Xinhuaxi proudly took home the title of "Origin of Hunan Red."
At the Xinhua Black Tea Exhibition Hall, a Fujian tea merchant was taken with a high mountain tea called "Bing Li Chun" and immediately placed an order.
Wang Zhun, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said with happiness that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but looking at the scene of the Tea Expo, there are many highlights.
Xinhua black tea with a touch of red reflects the essence of tea culture, boasting popularity and trade volume. The Hunan tea industry welcomes a new spring.

Metaphysics refers to the study of problems that cannot be directly answered through perception, but are instead studied through rational deduction and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental law of philosophy, aimed at explaining the basic properties of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "Metaphysics" is taken from a line in "The Book of Changes • Appended Statements on the Hexagrams": "What is above form is called the Way, and what is below form is called an instrument." The term was translated into Japanese by Tetsuro Watsuji during the Meiji period.
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology, and its extended issues.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real entities that exist, and which nouns only represent concepts."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
The theoretical foundation holds that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural causes, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution theory.
The naturalism approach refers to a research method that does not mention God.
Philosophy of mind is the philosophical branch that studies the nature of consciousness and their relationship with the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought when discussing the relationship between the mind and body.
Epistemology is a philosophical branch that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline that systematically reflects on and studies human moral life; here, morality is defined as all behavioral standards recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (which abstractly studies ethical theory or critiques its nature) and normative ethics (which evaluates various moral views and provides moral criteria recommendations for correct or incorrect behavior).
It studies what kind of moral code people should follow, applies ethics (applying ethical theories to practical life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and describes ethics (collecting information about how people live, summarizing from observed patterns).
Its examination of ethics does not start from expected theories, but rather investigates the actual moral agents' real choices that have been observed, and all the moral factors that have contributed to these decisions. It examines the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, as well as medieval Christian ethics.
Part 1: The ethical ideas of humanism, represented by figures such as Valla and Montaigne.
Part two: The ethical thought of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
Part Three: Political Ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, Modern Ethics (17-18th century, British Empiricist Ethics represented by figures like Hume, 17-18th century, Continental Rationalist Ethics represented by figures like Spinoza, 18th century, French Enlightenment Ethics represented by figures like Voltaire, 18-19th century, German Academy Ethics represented by figures like Kant and Hegel, 18-19th century, British Utilitarian Ethics represented by figures like Bentham and Sidgwick, 19th century, British Evolutionary Ethics represented by figures like Spencer and Huxley, Late 19th century, German Neo-Kantian Ethics represented by figures like Rickert, Late 19th century, Neo-Hegelian Ethics represented by figures like Thomas Hill Green), Transitional Ethics (Irrationalist Ethics represented by figures like Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche).
Logic is a subject that studies "the principles and standards of valid inference and proof."
Logic typically consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning, and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline that focuses on the study of the essence and meaning of beauty.

Ding Zilin: To a Friend.
I would like to sincerely thank all of my friends for their humanitarian assistance during the more than 30 years since our loved ones passed away. Especially since my personal appeal for humanitarian aid to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, the assistance has not stopped until now.
Nowadays, the vast majority of the victims' parents have already passed away, and the orphans have grown up and found a job.
Your charitable act helped us, the families in distress, get through the most difficult time.
Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging the world, and most of the donors are already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you stop providing difficult relatives of ours with humanitarian donations to the Tiananmen Mothers group. This humanitarian relief activity should have ended long ago with a perfect conclusion.
I will always remember your kindness, and firmly believe that your righteous actions will be recorded in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way. I ask my friends for understanding.
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Regarding ceramics industry: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction of the 32-year history of the International Federation for Chinas Survival (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF), which have been engaged in humanitarian relief work.
In the process of engaging in humanitarian relief, the All-American Chinese Student Union and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations with frequent cross-over of project executors.

The rescue funds often cannot be successfully delivered to the hands of the victims of the June Fourth incident.
In 1994, upon the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was formed by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June Fourth Orphan Education Fund". After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June Fourth orphans graduated from university, MCDF subsequently established the "June Fourth elderly needy assistance fund for special hardship households" and has been implementing it ever since.
The funds for these projects mainly come from donations from the campus and society during the events of June Fourth, individual generous contributions, and support from the brother universities' democratic foundations.
Since 2018, we have also received support from the Labor Education and Research Foundation.
Until last year, after a gap of 31 years, the victims of the June Fourth Incident finally received a portion of the donations raised in the name of the incident from Hong Kong.
During this period, "China Human Rights" has also independently carried out its humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding stopped the donations for the June Fourth incident out of consideration for the donors. We are indeed retired elderly people with less income than before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Teacher Ding for his letter to friends.
We will respect the decision of the stakeholders and terminate this project within two years, and immediately resume it when necessary.
For those fellow companions who have always insisted on generously donating and risked sending humanitarian aid funds for years, gratitude and respect are also expressed together.

Please consider the actual viscosity of the sample liquid comprehensively and increase your flow rate parameter value from slow to fast accordingly.
After finishing the experiment with universal chips, please clean the internal channels promptly, otherwise it may cause blockages easily.
Microfluidic chips are consumables and cannot be repeatedly used for a long time.

Thank you for the rabbit's review. Originally, it was said that rejecting the antique style was not suitable for it, but the finished product came out so beautiful.
Thank you for Dan Dan's approval. Your satisfaction can give us energy to move forward, and we will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really great! I highly recommend all my friends to come and visit!
From reception, make-up, costumes, lighting, photography to post-production, everything is impeccable.
The makeup artist is particularly meticulous, and will match a makeup look suitable for you according to your style, using only top-tier cosmetic brands.
As for Teacher Tian Liang, let alone saying, he is extremely professional in photography.
The entire studio has a strong artistic atmosphere, and there are also two small cats accompanying and playing with everyone.
We work in Beijing. The better photo studios in Beijing require a six-month advance booking. Some of our colleagues have done their shoots in Beijing and we saw their photos, but we only found them to be just so so.
I specifically searched for this studio, which is a place with soul and attitude.
"Our facial expression management is quite poor. We feel that this is also a weakness for most people. Photographer Liang will capture and record the natural and wonderful moments."
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production designer, an excellent team.
Everyone around us praises it as soon as it comes out.
I have already recommended my best friend to go, and she was also very happy after watching the film.
I hope that such a studio will not be buried and that more people will discover it, shoot in their own style instead of following the crowd.
Thank you very much for the five-star reviews from Zhan Ying and Jing Ling. Both of them are very creative and innovative newcomers. We are a creative studio and we always do our best to satisfy our customers. We are grateful to have met and known them.
Sweet and attentive assistant, as well as lively and outgoing photographer teachers - everyone on the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shoot and an unforgettable experience. Moreover, the outcome of the shoot was much better than I could have imagined. Thank you so much to everyone for their hard work. 😘😘
Thank you for Xiao Yu's comment. It's also fate to meet you all. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the distance of trust between us is thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to know you all and hope to visit Qinhuangdao again next time.
How do I give you the money?

The restaurant staff is calling me now.
A programming newbie who wants to share personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, it's good to choose a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to learn on your own. After all, training costs a lot of money, and you also need to spend six months to learn.
But if you plan to break into this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who have weak self-discipline, training is an excellent choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First, you need to consider the teaching staff strength of this institution. If the teaching staff is not strong enough, then the training institution would be meaningless. Of course, the teaching staff of some newly established training institutions is not particularly strong.
Secondly, before making a choice, inquire about the training institution. It is best to inquire about the students who have come out of the institution because only the institution's students can know the quality of the institution, and whether the courses taught are good or bad.
Hello, to be honest, I am not sure how to answer your question because you haven't given any specific information about your own situation, and learning this thing is highly dependent on personal circumstances.
For example, your major, age, desired language to learn, and even the city you are in are all related to the industry you want to study or work in.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or if you have already graduated in computer science, I personally suggest self-study if you have enough time. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but the cost of learning is high and it takes more time, usually requiring concentration for 3-6 months.
However, if it's the situation I described, self-study is very convenient. There are many free learning resources available online, or you can also find numerous training resources on Bilibili. If you don't know how to find resources, you can contact me through the introduction to obtain free resources. Alternatively, you can also consult me in detail.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with video for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but you are able to pay certain learning costs in terms of time and money, it is recommended to go to a training institution for learning. This way, learning does not have to be difficult, and the teachers' explanations are also very detailed. There are also people available to answer any questions. Additionally, it can be helpful for learning planning and monitoring.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements and offer referral opportunities. After studying, they recommend you to the company, which saves you a lot of trouble in the job search and interview process.
The above are some of my opinions. The earlier discourse was only briefly introduced and not detailed because I did not fully understand your situation. If you have any other questions to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication and exchange.

It's hard to work in any industry nowadays!
But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude and enough perseverance and effort, I will be a little better than others, at least better than those who just complain and do nothing.
The plan for the day lies in the morning. All the good things begin from the morning. I hope you set off with happiness, luck, health, and good wishes, and maintain a good mood for the entire day. Good morning.
When we were young, happiness was something we possessed and having it brought us happiness. As we grew up, happiness became a goal that we strived to achieve in order to be happy. As we mature, we realize that happiness is actually a state of mind and understanding this brings us happiness.
Be your most genuine and kindest self, follow your heart, live your life with no regrets; Life is a journey, walk your own path; There are two treasures in life: a healthy body and a happy mood, live beautifully and live long!
At every stage of life, one will encounter different difficulties.
Often, what binds you is not your ability, but the courage to face things positively.
Since you cannot avoid it, it would be better to face it calmly.
The more you are afraid, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you face difficulties head-on, the problem will eventually be solved easily.
Curators from China and Saudi Arabia join hands to organize the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua net.
Riyadh, December 12th, Xinhua News Agency (reporter Wang Haizhou, Hu Guan) - The first contemporary art biennial exhibition in Saudi Arabia, the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial Exhibition, was officially open to the public on the 11th at the Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of the Saudi capital, Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other places participated in the exhibition.
This biennial exhibition was jointly planned by the Saudi Darat al Funun Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Tian Feiyu, the director of the UCCA, serving as artistic director.
According to the exhibition curation team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", which metaphorically represents the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transition and also reflects the current situation of Saudi Arabia's social and cultural development.
This biennial exhibition covers an area of ​​nearly 12,000 square meters, and the exhibition halls span six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones," "Inheriting as Experiment," "Thinking on the Edge," "Moving Towards the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art."
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total exhibits, including various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art; The works of 12 Chinese artists are also highly valued. Some artists use recycled materials in creative ways. For example, in his "Endless Landscape of Mountain and River of the Behind the Story Series" (2014), Xu Bing reconstructed a classic landscape painting with waste materials.
Barakat, the CEO of the Dhahran Exhibition Foundation, expressed his hope that the current biennial exhibition could establish international dialogue, giving global audiences the opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen interaction and exchange.
Tian Feiyu said, "The goal of the biennial exhibition is twofold: it not only allows Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue but also enables Saudi audiences to integrate into the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that during the opening period of the biennial exhibition, a series of lectures will also be held. Artists, curators, and leaders in the creative industry will hold discussions on topics such as cross-cultural communication and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinating and Standardizing Management of Public Welfare Positions in Rural Areas - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12th (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to provide assistance for the employment of the poverty-stricken population and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies related to the management of public welfare positions in rural areas to promote rural revitalization and help advance the comprehensive development of rural areas.
An official from the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security introduced that currently, a total of 448,300 rural public welfare positions have been developed in Yunnan to provide employment opportunities for impoverished laborers and other disadvantaged groups in rural areas. These positions play an important role in helping lift people out of poverty, consolidate poverty alleviation achievements, and improve the overall capacity of rural public services.
This new regulation is jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan People's Social Security, Rural Revitalization, Finance, and others, mainly to unify and standardize the object range, fund management, position development, and position management of recruiting public welfare personnel for grassroots rural positions.
In terms of job development and setting, the new regulations specify that it should be done in accordance with the principles of "setting up posts as needed, determining personnel based on the posts, dynamic management, and overall control of the quantity", "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible", and "one person per post, voluntary public disclosure, and unified management".
The recruitment process must follow the steps of announcement, application, review, public announcement, hiring, pre-job training and job assignment.
In addition, the new regulations also specify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of public welfare posts in rural areas, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for public welfare posts in rural areas. The regulations stipulate that development departments of public welfare posts in each rural area shall purchase commercial insurance for accidental injuries for personnel placed in public welfare posts in rural areas. Relevant departments are required to regularly supervise the distribution of subsidies for public welfare posts in rural areas.

Hello
Can the order be cancelled?
"I am placing a new order."
Has it been cancelled?
Secondly, although the right-wing has had moments of success in history, they did not last long. This is because they were like flowers that bloomed brightly with a little sunshine, and sweat at the slightest exertion. Once they achieved a little success, they would set their sights on other regions and long for more, but in times of hardship, they would easily switch sides.
But to be honest, the right-wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right-wing in defining the standard of truth after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving science and technology, promoting institutionalization of government and protecting human rights should not be denied.
3. Personally speaking, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's views, I take his words seriously and also respect him as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes China's social issues seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theories. I believe that anti-revolution is necessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social turbulence and harm to people's livelihoods. Political groups will become chaotic and mixed, and foreign countries will take advantage of the situation.
Fourthly, to bring about change or improvement in China, one must have patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and its people. Those who attempt political opportunism to benefit themselves are not rightists, they are scoundrels.
Let's chat about the left again.
"Left, is actually a group of abandoned children of their time and politics."
If the Right has a positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will also listen to some right-wing views and analyze their thinking when necessary. However, the Left does not have this fortune, as what the Left wants is precisely the dregs discarded by the Communist Party!
5. Recently, I've seen some friends arguing with anti-protesters while also refuting leftist extremism, and they were quite agitated. I don't think it's necessary to do so.
Don't try to reason with traitors or lunatics, they are the same stubborn kind and can't be persuaded with rational arguments.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about getting the rebels and the extreme leftists to acknowledge it. What's the point?
I tell my friends like this: When the rebels call you "wu mao" (a term used to describe paid Chinese internet commentators) and the leftists call you a "rightist dog", it just proves that our middle way is correct!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but forget about them when they grow old, or pursue their ideals but fall into a state of obsession.
With the ideal gradually drifting away, even the young boy who slaughtered dragons eventually becomes an evil dragon.
I think that "left and right" generally refer to restraint and freedom. Due to China's historical and cultural genes, it is generally leaning towards the left.
The domestic right-wing emphasizes freedom, efficiency, and development, while the left-wing emphasizes stronger regulation and prioritizes fairness and safety.
In today's society, overall there is a desire for more emphasis on fairness. At the same time, with the competition between China and the United States, taking a left-leaning position is certain. It is estimated that this will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand it, just give it a like and be done with it.
No need to say more, Hua Hua is just so righteous.
In the past two years, the United States' blockade and encirclement of Huawei's chips has not only put Huawei in unprecedented difficulty but also caused tremendous losses to "American" enterprises.
The United States is suppressing China's chip industry and demanding that its own companies and allied countries' companies simultaneously block China's chip industry. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, causing a decrease in research and development investment and production capacity of chip manufacturing companies, resulting in a disruption of the global chip supply chain shortage.
Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has affected various major industries globally, such as automobile manufacturers suspending production and mobile phone prices rising, and almost all industries that use chips are deeply affected by it.
In order to grasp the autonomy of "chip", more and more technology giants in various countries are starting to move towards the "de-Americanization" road.
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor dominance and hinder the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently taken frequent actions, such as hosting the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 countries' giants to establish a semiconductor alliance, while supporting American local technological giants. For example, the veteran American technology giant Intel has invested $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona to regain its dominant position in the chip field, and has opened up chip foundry services to the outside world.
When most people thought that Intel's actions would have a certain impact on TSMC and it was likely to snatch TSMC's "rice bowl".
The reason why we are so confident is that Intel, as an old-school technology giant in the United States, has been deeply rooted in the semiconductor industry for decades and has a large team of talented people and technological reserves. Therefore, it is sure to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou scoffed at Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising remark about Intel's investment in building a wafer factory. Without any hesitation, Zhang Zhongmou bluntly stated that it is ironic for Intel to build a chip foundry.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou despises Intel's entry into the wafer field is because he still holds a grudge against Intel from over 30 years ago, when TSMC had a dispute with them.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel had always been a jewel in the crown of American manufacturing industry, occupying the peak position in the world and dominating the semiconductor industry.
Until the 1980s, the high-end semiconductor chips in the world were always controlled by a small number of powerful entities.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, where a single factory was responsible for the design, manufacturing, and packaging testing of chips. Intel was the representative company of that era.
However, this model makes some small businesses unable to bear the cost, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only shy away from huge production line construction expenses.
Under the influence of market demand, beginning in the 1980s, the chip industry began to experience the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, after hearing about a company that specialized in chip design, Zhang Zhongmou believed that since there was a company focused on design, it was possible to establish a factory dedicated purely to wafer manufacturing.
Shortly after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC was born.
TSMC has focused their main business on "wafer processing", providing only contract manufacturing services for wafer fabrication without conducting design.
At the time of its establishment, TSMC was just a small fry in front of the giant - Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once approached Intel for investment, but at that time, Intel looked down upon TSMC as it only engaged in the manufacturing process of the chip industry and arrogantly refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel at that time looked down upon wafer foundry services.
Unexpectedly, the giant who used to look down on wafer manufacturing services is now also starting to do wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that it was ironic for Intel to enter into wafer foundry manufacturing.
Nowadays, the market value of TSMC has surpassed that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong offensive, Intel naturally cannot afford to stand still.
Nowadays, TSMC has already sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from 7 years ago.
To catch up is actually not an easy task.
"I can't wait anymore" or "I am not waiting anymore".
It's been 2 hours since I placed the order at 19:06 😅.
Today, let's take a look at some "weird hot searches".
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot topics: "Dragon raising its head on the second day of the second lunar month," "Haoliyou price increase," and "Huo La La incident." Public opinion will spread and form a peak, and then the index will decrease (smooth curve) and eventually dissipate. If there is any secondary public opinion, there will be a small camel hump appearing again.
They look identical to the "Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model" displayed on the website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot search results related to the same event and present them in the forms of "solitary peak", "sawtooth", and "cliff".
【Solitary Peak Shape】refers to the rapid heating and promotion of a topic to the top of the hot search list, attracting public attention; 【Sawtooth Shape】refers to periodic heating, ensuring that the topic remains on the hot search list; 【Cliff Shape】refers to a collective evacuation when the topic has served its "function" and moves on to a new task and a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak in the heat of one event coincides exactly with the trough of another event, to the second, indicating that it is definitely the same batch of water army receiving orders and launching a new round of attack.
The specialization of black PR can be seen in a glimpse: dozens of hot topics simultaneously appearing on the list, some attracting attention, some responsible for popularizing knowledge, some inciting conflict and hype, some diverting attention, some affecting cognition, some misleading judgment, some stirring up emotions, some influencing decisions. Black industry accounts are used in batches and nodes for precise operations, considering almost all the elements in the spread of public opinion.
Dissemination is a science that, away from subjective factors such as position and emotions, only with objective data, black PR will also have nowhere to hide.
Wherever we go, we leave a mark; let's dig out these marks together.

Mauritius and other countries have discovered the first cases of Omicron strain infection- Xinhua News.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 (Xinhua) -- According to reports from Xinhua News Agency correspondents stationed abroad, Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have recently reported their first cases of COVID-19 infection caused by the new Omicron variant of the virus.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of Omicron variant infections in 10 days.
According to the Minister of Health of Mauritius, Kailash Jagutpal, one of the infected individuals is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on November 27th from South Africa. The other infected person is a local resident who tested positive for COVID-19 on November 30th after being in contact with someone who had recently travelled to South Africa and returned.
After isolation and treatment in the hospital, both of these infected individuals' nucleic acid tests have turned negative. They have now returned to their respective places of residence.
On the 10th, the Ministry of Health in Cyprus announced the first confirmed cases of three Omicron variant infections in the country.
These three individuals are all students. They returned from overseas travel at the beginning of this month. As they all have mild symptoms, they have not been admitted to the hospital for treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, the government of Seychelles continues to increase its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th of next year, passengers over 12 years old who enter the country by plane will need to pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival in Sichuan.
On the 10th, the Serbian Ministry of Health announced that it will start administering the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to children aged 5 to 11 in the country.
Malawi's Minister of Health, Khumbize Kandodo Chiponda, announced on the 9th that the country has recorded three cases of the Omicron variant of the virus for the first time.
The country's health department conducted genomic sequencing on 12 new coronavirus-positive samples collected between November 9 and December 2, and discovered these three cases of infection.

Address: 12th floor, Xingfu Jiayuan, No. 156, Huancheng South Road.
At the beginning, it was through a friend's recommendation and trust that I chose to take a look. Initially, my budget was 70,000 yuan for a basic renovation.
As soon as you arrive in the store, a series of scams begins.
I went to the store for the first time and only showed them the floor plan of my house. They didn't actually measure the house, but surprisingly they were able to give me a quote saying that they could do my 135-square-meter house for 70,000 yuan. They roughly showed me their materials, but I don't know what brand they were.
Their second scam is that as soon as you go to the store, they will drag you to pay the deposit (and once you pay, you can never get it back unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I hesitate whether to pay a deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, we can give you certain discounts.
This is a big scam, and I am living proof of being deceived. When I was impulsive, I paid a deposit of over ten thousand yuan.
His quotation to me has a lot of issues. The 70,000 yuan does not include the cost of water and electricity renovation, nor does it include any doors, cabinets or bathroom fixtures, which are the major expenses for the basic decoration.
In addition to this, their service point fees are higher than those of other companies.
"I have lost trust in this company. They made me sign a contract without explaining anything clearly at the beginning."
"When I went to ask them to return the money, they acted very experienced and had a specialized team to deal with you."
No matter what happens, they will wholeheartedly take responsibility for the customer's problem and bear no fault whatsoever.
There are various ways they shirk their responsibilities, as well as many details that I don't want to mention one by one, which are all tears. In short, do not choose them, because my friend also had a poorly constructed house when they hired them for renovation, and later they calculated all sorts of fees for them.
"Cheaters! They were originally selling those fake dragon head decorations, now they changed the name to Da Mei, but it seems like they have gone bankrupt again and changed to something else."
So everyone, don't choose such a terrible renovation company.
In the future, when making choices, everyone should Baidu more and look up information on these things, because home decoration is not inexpensive.
To ask a question to the merchant, please log in or register first.
Strictly prohibit the publication of various forms of business reviews, please refer to the Merchant Inclusion Statement for details.
Dianping Kunming Decoration and Design Channel provides you with the latest merchant information, including address, phone number, and business hours of DAMEI 360 Integrated Home Furnishing. If you're looking for a decoration company, just go to Dianping.
This is so scary, if it doesn't arrive in 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Okay, then please do not cancel this conversation. If I do not receive a refund within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue the matter.
I'm asking if it's possible to cancel in less than 15 minutes.
Kou Shui Ji should be cooked, but what I received was raw meat, so I cannot eat it.
Starry Sky's Rendezvous | Gemini Meteor Shower to Reach Maximum on the 14th - Xinhua News.
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12th - Astronomy popular science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year and one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, the Geminid meteor shower will reach its peak on December 14th. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of that day.
The Gemini meteor shower photographed by Beijing amateur astronomer An Jiu on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai, China.
Most meteor showers are associated with periodic comets, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is the asteroid 3200 Phaethon, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also currently the second known meteor shower that is not "nurtured" by a comet.
Shu Li-peng, a member of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an astronomy popularization expert, introduced that like a blockbuster movie released during the Chinese New Year, the Gemini meteor shower often appears at the end of the year, and its "theatrical release" can last from December 4 to 17.
This meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and is one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere along with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteoroids move at a slower speed, are colorful, and there are also plenty of fireballs, making it suitable for both visual observation and beginner astrophotography.
Yang Jing, an astronomy enthusiast of Tianjin city, captured the Geminid meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13th, 2020.
The astronomical forecast shows that this year's Gemini meteor shower will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14th, with a ZHR (the number of meteors visible per hour under ideal viewing conditions with the radiant point located directly overhead) of 150.
Gemini meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the 'falling petals in abundance' Gemini meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be affected by moonlight interference, and the level of excitement will be slightly reduced."
On the 14th day of the lunar calendar in November, the moon is in its full phase and its bright light may interfere with observations. However, in the latter half of the night, the moon will set, and the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them during these few hours after the moon sets in the later part of the night, but be sure to keep warm and wear adequate clothing.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city. Instead, one can choose a high-altitude, low-light pollution area in the suburbs or countryside, facing northeast with a wide view. After patiently waiting for the moon to set, visual observation can then be carried out."
It should be noted that the Gemini meteor shower has a high flow in various directions, so when observing, there is no need to constantly stare at the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower.
For friends who love photography and wish to capture a splendid "meteor shower scene", it is best to choose a wide-angle lens with a large aperture and use high ISO and the maximum aperture when shooting.
Considering stability and sustainability, tripod, spare battery and shutter release cable are also essential.

What are the differences in market positioning between laser TV and traditional TV?
In my understanding, the traditional television mentioned by the OP should refer to LCD TVs, while the main differences in market positioning between laser televisions and LCD TVs are as follows:
First, laser TV focuses more on the large screen market.
Compared to the widespread market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs clearly focus more on the large screen market, or rather, laser TVs are products born specifically for the large screen market.
Currently, mainstream LCD TVs are mostly in the size range of 55 inches to 65 inches, whereas the size of laser TVs is generally 75 inches and above, with the largest size over 100 inches, fully satisfying the needs of users for large screen televisions.
In recent years, the shipment and sales proportion of laser TV have been continuously increasing worldwide, accounting for more than 60% of the overall sales of televisions with a size of 80 inches or above.
According to Zhong Yikang's prediction, in 2020, the sales growth of laser TVs will exceed 140%, continuing its high-speed growth.
The reason for such good results in the large screen market is mainly attributed to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight emission of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The Saixi laboratory of the China Electronics Standardization Research Institute and ophthalmology experts from Beijing Union Medical College Hospital conducted strict comparative tests of laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions for the same group of people, obtaining 144 sets of test data.
Data confirms that laser TVs do have strong eye protection characteristics and in certain aspects, even have some improvement effects.
In the current era where visual health is increasingly being emphasized, laser televisions are not only attracting more and more users with their eye protection advantages, but also opening up another breakthrough in the television market.
Secondly, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the continuously falling prices of LCD TVs, the current price of commercially available laser TVs is mostly over 10,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light sources, the price is gradually increasing.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
Definitely makes sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, laser TVs have many advantages that LCD TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
With the ultra-short throw projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is relatively shorter compared to traditional projection equipment, which can achieve a 100-inch screen experience within a short distance, requiring less space, and the host is small and takes up very little space.
In terms of brightness, large brand laser TVs can reach over 2000 lumens.
In addition, with lower heat generation and less equipment damage, the lifespan of the TV is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and biomimetic screens, which can bring users even more stunning audio-visual experiences.
It's not really a false demand, but a product of subdivided demand. In terms of image quality and cost-effectiveness, laser TVs are not suitable for audio and video enthusiasts. If you want to balance a large screen and a proper viewing environment, you can give it a try. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages, so judge for yourself after weighing the pros and cons. Don't just believe in one side of the story.
Simply put, the ultra-wide-angle short-throw projector - laser TV, in order to fit closely to the screen, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors, which does not meet the best optical design.
In order to block out some ambient light, a micro-structured Fresnel screen is used, but it comes at a high cost, and the price of an 80-inch screen can basically be exchanged for a 65-inch LCD.
There's one more thing, I especially dislike projector manufacturers using diffuse reflection as a selling point for eye comfort. Please, the light that can be seen by the eyes on the screen is just direct light, the light that is diffused onto the ceiling can't be seen by the eyes. Even if you really want to be technical, LCD TVs also have diffuse "direct light", and when you turn on the TV, the ceiling is also illuminated, isn't it?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse, it cannot become an image at all.
The heat spot (light spot) effect of high gain projector screen has been neglected, and when a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes from a certain angle, that is the real discomfort.
Wen Photography Studio prioritizes quality and aesthetics, but currently does not have any branch stores.
After adding WeChat to make an appointment, the lady sent me a list of available time slots promptly and replied to my messages in a timely manner.
Before going, I looked at the shop's photoshoot works, which mostly are outdoor wedding dresses and they were shot very beautifully, and involved a variety of shooting styles.
After arriving that day, I had a brief conversation with the young lady about my ideas, and she patiently helped me try two different styles of clothing that I was indecisive about. We eventually finalized on a makeup and hairstyle for the shoot. The photographer set up some props beforehand and gave instructions on posing, striving for excellence in every detail.
But perhaps because there was no specific communication with me about the shooting ideas, what was taken was not the style I wanted, but it should still be beautiful 🙊🙊.
After taking the photos, the photographer will help choose the best ones and discuss the post-processing style. They seem very attentive and meticulous.
It will take about two weeks to fix the video, so please wait for the result patiently.
I won the second photo-themed free meal event again. Most of the clothes in the venue can be chosen for a photo shoot.
Finally, I chose a black chiffon dress to try out a different style.
The entire filming process takes about 2 hours, including makeup and photography. The photographer in charge of the shoot is a younger brother born in 1995, who seems a little inexperienced. Hoping that in the future, he can provide more advice on directing customers during the shoot. He is quite talkative, and the filming process is relatively enjoyable.
Wen Photography Museum's Quality Store for Aesthetic Visual Photography, reply.
Featured on the front page, come and take a look at Queenie~
First, you fill in your name and phone number when you arrive at the store. Then you choose clothing, including wedding dresses. The staff is patient when you change into three or four outfits. After selecting your outfit, it takes a long time to do your makeup. The service is good, and during the shoot, they will teach you how to pose. However, the pictures make your face look quite large, but after retouching, which only took three or four days instead of half a month as promised, the result was almost identical to the original.
[Environment] Overall, it's fine.
There are many optional clothes.
There are approximately three makeup locations, and inside is a photo studio.
[Service] is very enthusiastic and attentive.
The stylist is quite patient.
Photographers will also earnestly teach you the poses.
If the customer is not satisfied, the photographer will take the initiative to propose a reshoot.
[Experience] The styling may have gone a bit too far, originally the double eyelids were made into triple eyelids by sticking them.
"The tail of the eyebrow was also shaved, which is a bit awkward for those who don't normally draw their eyebrows."
The photos were given about ten days ago, but the photo editing effect is not very satisfactory. It feels like the double eyelid stickers are still quite obvious.
Because I was not quite sure what style I wanted, I tried two sets of clothes. In the end, after a lot of deliberation, I chose a black dress. The sales lady said that this outfit had a Hepburn vintage style.
After selecting the clothes, I started to do my hair and makeup. Both the hairstylist and the makeup artist sisters were very patient in helping me. The result was very satisfactory.
After getting my makeup and hair done, we started taking photos. The photographer directed me on how to pose the whole time and the process was very relaxed and harmonious.
After taking the photos, carefully select four favorite shots for post-production. The young man said that the finished products will be ready within 15 minutes, and the ending was very satisfying.
I haven't received any reply for 3 days... Because your system couldn't recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card for payment every time.
I have to pay for shipping every time now.
"Can I be exempted first, and you can collect my monthly fee after you finish your investigation, is that okay?"
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Xiaoyusan is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision and Administration of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", in order to become an insurance brokerage company, three key criteria must be met: shareholders, promoters must have no significant violations in the past three years, a minimum registered capital of RMB 50 million is required to establish the company, and approval from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission is required.
These three requirements are actually very strict. To summarize, insurance brokers must have the strength to meet the approval of the national authority, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), which oversees insurance companies and banks nationwide. Additionally, shareholders must have a good reputation. As for Little Umbrella Insurance, there is no need for policyholders to question whether it is legitimate or not because of these three requirements, which not every insurance company can meet.
On this point, it's pretty good and trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products, the small umbrella insurance is like an insurance supermarket where many companies' star critical illness insurance policies are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched HeTai Super Mary No.5 critical illness insurance policy, where the claim and underwriting parties are both HeTai Life, and the small umbrella insurance is just a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment methods, internet platform products have a higher cost-effectiveness compared to traditional insurance products due to the lower operating costs of physical branches and employee salaries. In addition, internet products offer flexible payment options such as monthly payments, reducing the financial burden on policyholders, and maximizing the leverage of insurance policies.
This is still very good.
Can consider.
From the perspective of professionalism of the salesperson: this is particularly important, because insurance is an industry that demands high levels of professionalism. Many online insurance products allow customers to purchase insurance themselves, but this can lead to many misunderstandings, especially in relation to health information and occupation. Non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective beliefs when purchasing insurance, thinking they are healthy or qualified, which can lead to many potential insurance claims risks and the possibility of being denied a payout.
"I have worked as a telephone salesperson for insurance at Tencent Microinsurance (similarly to Xiaoyusan, an internet insurance brokerage platform) and I can responsibly tell everyone."
Internet insurance is genuine and reliable, but the people selling it may not be. The internet channel lacks professional practitioners and there are many cases of sales misrepresentation.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance and get a free phone, and receive a free critical illness coverage of 60,000. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but the emphasis is misplaced. They do not tell policyholders that the first month is only 1 yuan and the following months will be charged at the normal rate, ranging from tens to 200 yuan. Many customers do not know what they have bought after deducting the fees for one or two years.
Thinking that one could spend 1 yuan and the insurance company would pay 6 million yuan (thinking that money falls from the sky).
Free mobile phones are only given for special policy numbers ending with digits like 6666 or 8888, and if the winning text message is sent out, there will be no one reminding or exchanging it for the recipient.
(For the policyholder, this is another pitfall) Claiming a free 60,000 yuan coverage for critical illness is only short-term. Relying solely on this without any other commercial insurance could be problematic. In the event of an actual critical illness, what can 60,000 yuan do? It won't solve the problem, and you'll be left with financial difficulties in the future.
Currently, the government is also cracking down on misleading internet insurance sales.
Therefore, overall speaking, there is no problem with the platform or the product. The issue lies with the professionalism and work ethics of the salespersons.
It is suggested that the topic owner should consider it carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokers have a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and options to choose from. Some products also offer better value for money than internet products.
I have personally assisted 59 internet customers in purchasing offline insurance products, saving each of them an average of 2000-3000 yuan per year in premiums.
If anyone has any questions, they are welcome to communicate and exchange with me.
I am Mingya, an insurance broker with 3 years of experience in corporate management training. I have served nearly a thousand corporate clients and cooperated with over 100 insurance companies. Before purchasing insurance, I customize insurance products tailored to the needs of customers. During the insurance process, I help customers compare and select the best insurance policies and strive to obtain the best underwriting results for them. After purchasing insurance, I organize and manage their insurance policies, providing them with peace of mind.
Grow together with every client for a lifetime.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the OP (original poster)!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insured person can complete the entire insurance process independently by clicking on the insurance application link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor does not need to sign either. All steps can be completed independently by the policyholder.
Although applying for internet insurance doesn't have much "ceremony", and even lacks a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effectiveness of the electronic contract.
This kind of model is somewhat similar to the assembly line operation of "telemarketing", but there is also a fatal problem with buying insurance in this way, which is that the subsequent services may not be able to keep up.
Insurance usually involves a long-term contract that can last for several decades. When we purchase insurance, shouldn't we carefully consider whether the "middleman" we select is someone who can accompany us for the long-term and provide us with services even after many years have passed?
So how can I contact the delivery specialist?
It's almost 3 o'clock.
Does that mean you are going to give me compensation?
I said I would knock the door and deliver the goods.
But the rider just left it at the door and then walked away.
"Sent wrong."
Your delivery driver has picked up my order at #NUMBER#, but I am still being informed that it's awaiting delivery.
The delivery rider has already received my takeaway at 19:25, but still refuses to depart.
I will go buy it. Do you want any other takeout?
What to do?
Where did your rider go?
Do we still need to wait?
"I am here to deliver an order."
Okay, if you don't cancel, I'll call the police.
But my food will have safety and hygiene problems.

Just enter the coupon code to make up for it.
No problem, remember there is no need to arrange for a resend, I have already purchased it separately, and don't want to waste it.
Thank you for your help.
From the past until now, I have always been against any form of slandering and insults, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can be tolerant of everything, but we must eradicate this kind of villain.
If we don't consider political parties and factions, what we should resist first is this kind of uncivilized behavior.
Since you started sending me Facebook friend requests, then posting posts with satire, and even trying to publish the so-called location of my home and my father's name on social media, I have already adopted an attitude of not responding.
Afterwards, you not only continued to tag me at a frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss ambiguously and humiliate me with your so-called friends on Facebook, leaving comments about my appearance, figure, fertility, and even some suggestive messages about planting strawberries in bed. I...just forget it.
Later, I received more messages from friends with regard to your Facebook account, including a picture of you and comments with sexual harassment content.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
After the news of my report to the police was uploaded, you didn't show any restraint at all, but instead became even more arrogant.
I don't care about what political background you have, or what your identity and status are. In our society, it is necessary to have respect between genders.
Yes, you can continue with this type of sarcastic, indirect, humiliating, and insulting speech. You can also continue to say that you only care and concern about me. You may continue to believe that this is not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that you created the picture or continue to make any aggressive comments.
"Right, I cannot and do not have the ability to stop you."
I neither know you nor want to know you. My appearance and physique do not need your scrutiny or comments.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to be so humiliated by others for the sake of fame.
My friend asked me, "Are you okay?"
"I said it was good, but you still won't believe it."
I don't think there is any girl who can say she's okay after being bullied like this.
Whether it's in work, society, politics or business, only those who lack basic morals would choose to use this method to harm any woman.
I believe that justice lies within the hearts of the people.
"I have collected some messages for everyone to evaluate and make a judgment."
"Your own post should not be impersonated by anyone, right?"
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization.
A knowing smile.
Vietnam People's News Website - Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh Attends the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum.
During the Third National Forum for the Development of Vietnamese Digital Technology Enterprises, two main meetings were held to discuss topics related to digital technology enterprises and the national digital transformation, as well as the role of digital technology enterprises in the COVID-19 pandemic and their contribution to economic recovery and development after the pandemic.
Minister of Communications and Media, Nguyen Meng Xiong, stated that in 2021, despite the continued spread of COVID-19, the number and revenue of Vietnamese digital technology companies have maintained a growth momentum, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, the production of typical digital products in Vietnam has increased significantly, addressing major challenges that Vietnam is facing. Many of these digital products have also been exported overseas, leading to an improvement in Vietnam's digital technology ranking.
Minister Ruǎn Mèngxióng urges digital technology enterprises to take on the responsibility of developing national digital transformation platforms, and taking on the task of developing these national digital platforms is to take on the national mission.
On the forum, leaders from various departments and national government agencies are studying, developing, applying, and transferring digital technology to share with enterprises, organizations, and individuals in order to mobilize and gather resources from the entire society to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises and work together to promote national digital transformation, as well as breakthrough ideas and solutions for economic recovery after the pandemic.
Premier Fan Mingzheng emphasized during his speech at the forum that digital transformation is an inevitable path for the world and a objective demand for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation services should be for everyone, therefore, it is necessary to mobilize everyone's participation.
People and enterprises are the core, subject, target, and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies need to be for the people and businesses.
Premier Fan Mingzheng emphasized that digital transformation needs to embody the national spirit, focusing on internal strength as the primary factor for strategy, long-term goals and determining outcomes, with external factors serving as important opportunities for breakthroughs.
He believes that digital transformation needs to drive deeper and sustainable development, participate in COVID-19 prevention and control, economic recovery and development, respond to changes afterwards, overcome natural resource depletion, and help with green transformation and the development of green energy.
Digital transformation requires the participation in protecting and promoting the establishment of databases related to national cultural values, historical traditions, national customs, and so on. This will promote the digital transformation of fields including banking, taxation, land management and development databases, and logistics.
The ultimate goal of digital transformation is to make the people happier and the country increasingly prosperous and developed.
Premier Fan Mingzheng has required that all levels of government, organizations, and enterprises intensify leadership and guidance in developing digital technology, enhance their understanding of digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve the system for digital transformation, strengthen national governance, and promote the development of digital technology enterprises with a spirit of respect, communication, listening, initiative, and proactivity.
During the forum, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attended the 2021 "Vietnam Manufactured" Excellent Digital Product Award ceremony and the opening ceremony of the "Vietnam Manufactured" Digital Product Exhibition.

"2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit" opens under the theme of "Wisdom Gathering in Xiaoxiang" - Rolling News - Hunan Daily - Huasheng Online.
On December 10th, Hunan Daily News (by reporter Zhou Zhiheng) reported that on the 9th, the "Smartly Connect with Hunan" 2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit was opened in Zhuzhou.
Wang Cheng, a Standing Committee Member of the Provincial Committee and Minister of the Provincial Committee's Organization Department, attended the launch ceremony and delivered a speech.

A full-chain talent development system has been constructed, which has become fertile ground for talent growth, innovation, entrepreneurship, and a comfortable place to live and work.
Currently, Hunan is fully implementing the strategic positioning and mission of "Three Highs and Four News", and will further open the door to attract and gather talents, provide more favorable policies and concentrate more resources for talent innovation and entrepreneurship, and hope that outstanding talents from all walks of life can work together to contribute to the high-quality development of Hunan.

Here, the home appliances and furniture are relatively complete, with numerous brands including many famous ones.
During the Double 12 promotion period, go to "Hanstong" water purifier store to check out their water purifiers. The store is currently running a promotion, and prices are more favorable.
The "Juran Home" has a total of 11 floors, from the negative second floor to the 9th floor. The negative first and second floors are both parking lots, and parking is free during the day!
The surroundings are not great, there are few restaurants and hardware stores, and the restaurant food is just average.
This elevator is also very speechless. Just like having a serious illness, it goes back and forth between negative two and negative one. It doesn't stop at the floor I pressed, and when I took the safety passage down to the first floor, it was also very speechless. It directly led to a furniture store, which was closed and I couldn't get out through the safety passage.
There is still room for improvement in the Home Inn, and many areas have not been developed yet.

The main stream of the Yangtze River has achieved full coverage of comprehensive green water services zones - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11th (Reporter Wang Xian) On December 10th, Chongqing Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Area was completed and put into operation as scheduled. This is the second water-based green comprehensive service area officially operated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Area in Sichuan Province on December 8th.
So far, the waterborne green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, the deputy director of the Yangtze River Navigation Management Bureau of the Ministry of Transport, introduced that Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have built and operated 10 water-based green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by a large number of seafarers and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River transportation.
The full coverage of green comprehensive service area on water is another milestone in the development of green shipping on the Yangtze River. The capacity for receiving pollutants from ships and providing shipping services has been significantly enhanced.
According to the introduction, the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and life services to ships and crew members, helping them solve "urgent, difficult, worrying, and hopeful" problems.
The two water-based green comprehensive service areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, that have been built and put into operation, incorporate life services, production services and administrative services, with green environmental protection as the theme and ship maintenance and ship emergency rescue services as special features. This will enable ships to receive multiple services during their first mooring in the port and make the work and life of sailors sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and convenient.
"Three US aircraft carriers gather around China, rare visit of the most powerful weapon to Guam - according to Qinchina media report on January 17, 2022. The latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China. US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy’s arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and rivals in the Indo-Pacific region."
According to the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" of the Chinese think tank, on January 9th, a satellite discovered the US military's aircraft carrier "USS Carl Vinson" near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects that the USS Carl Vinson will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of F-35C fighter planes and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport planes on the aircraft carrier "Carl Vinson".
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier that departed from the United States on January 3 is also currently cruising in the Pacific Ocean.
The "USS Lincoln" also carried for the first time the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron, which belongs to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
Apart from the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently has the USS Ronald Reagan carrier stationed at Yokosuka, Japan in the Asia-Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes missile cruisers like the "Lake Champlain" and missile destroyers like the "Stockdale".
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three American aircraft carriers were gathering around China as the most powerful weapon for a rare visit to Guam.
(Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) US three aircraft carriers gather around China, most powerful weapons rare visit to Guam. Flight route of US military carrier transport aircraft CMV-22B on January 17, 2022.
(Weibo @South China Strategic Situation Perception) According to a January 17th report from CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
Last Saturday (January 15), the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, which is loaded with 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US Navy base in Guam.
US three aircraft carriers gather around China's periphery, the strongest weapons pay a rare visit to Guam. Analysts say this sends a signal to allies and enemies amid the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit of a US ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
US three aircraft carriers gather around China's periphery; the most powerful weapon makes a rare visit to Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea in recent years.
The picture shows China's Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) In its statement, the US Navy said that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine "USS Nevada" to Guam has strengthened cooperation between the US and its regional allies, demonstrated the US's capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of 14 "thundering submarines" in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
Surrounding the secrets of ballistic missile submarines, the "Thundering Submarine" has become the most important survival weapon of the "nuclear triad". This system also includes intercontinental ballistic missiles in launch silos located on US soil, as well as bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
I was chatting with a friend about the recent 26% drop in Meta and its market value evaporating by $251 billion. Zuckerberg responded by saying that they are facing unprecedented competition. What is the reason behind this?
Meta (formerly known as Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with its main revenue source being advertising. As a profitable advertising company in today's world, it has its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and so on, regardless of their functional positioning, are all traffic channels for Meta.
Not only that, but Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance". Many apps use Meta's advertising platform to monetize by externalizing Meta's advertisements.
However, times have changed.
Firstly, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it has become difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, which has affected the efficiency of advertising delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it will clearly prompt users whether to allow the app to access their information. The normal reaction of most people is certainly to not allow it.
If Google continues to stab, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factors in Meta's previous income growth have also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Usually, everyone knows that Meta does not have any business in China, but this understanding is not entirely accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from companies contributing to Meta's overseas business in China.
Meta has around several hundred employees in their Hong Kong office and several major agents in the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel where most of the money is spent.
Interestingly, ByteDance's TT now is one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made quite a bit of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
Various agents in China are helping Byte to place advertisements on Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China region is also very good.
Recently I haven't specifically looked into it, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning a lot of money overseas has passed.
Thirdly, the expansion of new traffic channels is not going smoothly.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms including TT are no longer in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but also the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only focuses on income, but more importantly, it looks at how the future expectations are.
Obviously, the expectations for Meta are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about the "Metaverse".
The metaverse is indeed one of the directions for the future, but the implementation cycle for the metaverse is relatively long. This story may not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the next two to three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Although Facebook is currently very prosperous, with annual revenue of $100-200 billion, in reality, it feels a strong sense of crisis. Compared to other internet and high-tech companies, it lacks a good and secure moat.
Although his several social software have a relatively high daily activity now and are mainstream social software such as Facebook and WhatsApp, facing the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook also lacks confidence, and the overthrow is just a matter of time.
The concept of metaverse is a distant and unattainable one, and there is no hope of success in the short term, so Facebook is very dangerous. This is why Zuckerberg keeps changing the company's name and constantly searching for new avenues. However, I believe that his choice of avenue is wrong and it is a dead end. These are just my thoughts for reference.
