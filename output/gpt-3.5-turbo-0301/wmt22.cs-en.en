The great return of a Czech jinx is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL.
Czech ice hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning back to the NHL.
The thirty-one-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the bench and could soon also get into goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Plzeň or Russian Čeljabinsk got injured during the preparation for NHL in October of this year.
Exactly in the middle of the game against Vegas, he was substituted and he has not appeared on NHL ice rinks since then.
The incident occurred at the moment when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one post to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," announced the team from Denver in early October.
His return to the NHL goal ultimately extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning American time, he was called from the farm where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In AHL, he recorded 94.5% of interventions.
The product of Plzen's hockey wants to finally make it and prove that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In the last season, he had problems with his hips, and in the shortened pandemic season, he didn't catch a single game.
In the NHL, "Francik" played in 36 games and his success rate in saves is at 92.3%.
Charles puts on a mask in his Christmas greeting, while William and Kate pose in Jordan.
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas wish.
Prince Charles also shared his wish, using a photograph in which he helps his wife Camilla put on a mask at the races.
The British news station BBC reported it on their website.
Greetings are being sent to friends, colleagues and foundations with whom they collaborate.
The photograph was taken somewhere in a desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is wearing long summer dresses in khaki color and Princess Charlotte also has a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a polo shirt with a collar, just like Prince George and Prince Louis.
William and Kate did not mention who took the photograph, and it is not clear exactly when it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed for a photograph to be used as a Christmas greeting, on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk county.
The picture that will serve as a Christmas greeting was also published by Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, the heir to the throne.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured photos at the Ascot horse races in June.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat on his head and a face mask over his nose and mouth, is helping Camille put on her color-coordinated face mask to match her light-colored dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbr a million for the title, Tvrdik denied it.
Prague - Detectives allegedly worked on the current corruption case with the belief that the accused former Vice President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Roman Berbr, had been promised one million Czech crowns by Prague's Slavia football club for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The website efotbal.cz reported that it gained access to a portion of police files.
The chairman of the board of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that the red-and-white team did not engage in any corrupt behavior.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar is prominently featured. He left the championship club last summer.
According to the document, the former influential official of the red and white team was in frequent contact with both Berber and former sports director of the second-league Vyšehrad team, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Investigators allegedly worked with the information that Slavia promised Berbra a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the team SK Slavia Praha won the title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was promised a million bribe by officials of SK Slavia Prague for winning the league, quoted from the file by the server.
According to detectives, Berbr met not only with Nezmar but also with the chairman of Slavia's board of directors Tvrdík one day later.
According to the file, it is not clear from the server whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík refused any corrupt behavior.
In the years 2015 to 2017, we actively sought to change the conditions in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
"We have never committed any illegal acts, did not attempt to influence referees in violation of fair play rules, and we have not provided any financial payments in this regard," Tvrdík stated for Seznam Zprávy.
In wiretaps, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some of the former dark-skinned Slavia players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdik.
Last October, a police operation was launched on multiple locations including the Prague headquarters of the Czech Football Association, in regards to the alleged match-fixing through the referees.
The highest-ranking person in the scandal is Berbr, who is no longer involved in any football functions.
In mid-January, just like former sports director of Vyšehrad Rogoz, he was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks, and IFVs are the larping of the Cold War.
The cannons will be new, but fundamentally of a worse type (artillerymen will have to work from an armored cabin and manually carry ammunition without any covers).
Cars - Toyota Hilux - are new and good.
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, moreover, they have already managed to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Airplanes: combat- decent, but at the end of lease, transport - too small with short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential.
Rockets - we don't have any (but we produce them and export them abroad).
AA (anti-aircraft defense): medium - Cold War era, outdated; short-range - good, modern, relatively good numbers.
I have such a story.
I have a hunting lodge right next to the city.
Nutria crawled out of the river and caused damage to crops, so I went there to sit.
When I was arriving, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I just sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
"I hoped that she would leave before something emerged, but of course the fox soon went."
"I let her come within 40 meters before deciding to shoot."
"Poor fisherman almost shit himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him, it was a close call."
Before I got down from the stand, it was gone.
That is, the meadow can be a problem.
On the other hand, it's not a war, many coincidences would have to occur for something to happen, you would probably be visible in thermal imaging, which almost everyone has today.
So, put expensive things by your feet into the sleeping bag in a visible place and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Vnitro managed to acquire respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health.
The state responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, respirators, and protective gear for professions closest to the coronavirus has spent billions of Czech crowns in the past weeks to acquire them.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during a single day, the prices for respirators differed by hundreds of crowns.
Why did the prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities acted economically?
And why did others shop more expensively?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with iRozhlas editor Dominika Kubištová.
I have respect for soldiers and the military (probably not influenced by memories of the Czechoslovak People's Army that older generations went through), but the Czech Republic is unable to benefit from mandatory military service.
We don't even have large storages of equipment that trained individuals could use, we don't actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, additionally modern equipment is constantly getting more complicated, so the abilities of the reservists will be rapidly diminishing over time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can be deployed, will take place very quickly, and there will be no time to retrain someone.
And finally, reservists/territorial defense have significant importance for countries such as Ukraine, where mass guerrilla warfare could be waged and it is also a pronounced necessity for deterring enemies.
The fight in the Czech Republic can only succeed in a conflict of such extent and intensity where guerrilla warfare is already irrelevant, and we don't have suitable geography for that.
We especially don't have individual skill.
It's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them play as if they owned it.
Then situations arise where you watch as a guy who missed an empty goal two minutes ago drives alone into an attack between 2 or even 3 Swiss players and you ask yourself "what do you think will happen now?"
Of course they will choose him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "beating the defender" is so terrible that I caught myself honestly surprised when I see that our striker was able to outplay one player of the opponent.
First swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, however, experts do not expect any significant breakthroughs in the following weeks.
According to statistical models, the pressure on hospitals will last for some time, and a new unknown factor has been added to the pandemic equation: the Omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta variant.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course, to what extent vaccination or post-infection immunity acquired by previous illness helps against it.
However, an unexpected phenomenon entered the plus side of the Covid equation this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new medication has arrived in the Czech Republic, the antiviral molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe illness and associated hospitalization by one-third and it can be treated at home.
And soon he should also be supplemented with the drug Paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of up to 85% from previous results.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic highlighted not only the hope for expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, but also raised the question of how prepared the local administration is for the incoming drugs.
As it was mentioned, the first to reach domestic patients will be Merck's molnupiravir.
The company was the first to finish on the tape because the medicine began to develop long before the current pandemic broke out with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for viral diseases of horses on the South American continent.
In these studies, it is often overlooked that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, especially us Czechs, are used to saying "as our beak grew."
"Do research where you ask people if they like Muslims."
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you without hesitation that no.
In the West, they will tell you how much they like migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist scum.
And then they go and vote for parties like AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing their job and being subjected to media lynching.
Then in the surveys it looks good, the west good, the east bad.
But will it really find out what people think.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmour have both over 20% according to a poll.
We even know that there are three objects in Czech and they are completely identical.
Identical because of the rotation of units, so that soldiers do not have to learn again where everything is, all objects are exactly the same.
From one, there is the Atom Museum in Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is, that the USSR didn't want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, whether for security reasons or because of their western location and slower deployment.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple tree), only warheads were stored, not the whole rockets as it is often said.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it onto some supporting device.
Apart from that museum maple, the rest are in a desolate state.
In the second grade of primary school, we had a Romani classmate and we were with him for four years.
He was quite okay, made good jokes, often too outspoken, but he was our mascot.
Everyone talked to him, he often walked and wanted to clarify something, he seldom missed, he attended regularly, he engaged in sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, and he dressed cleanly.
He also went to nature schools, did various monkey business, but was cool, perhaps never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, Gypsies, entered the same year, but different classes.
Shortly after that, they beat up a teacher, the police often dealt with something there, they threatened and endangered other students.
Personally, I occasionally sell something through an advertisement (old things, things I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Roma people, they always had the money and did not try any attempts to bargain me down, the communication was calm.
I actually sold a car this way, the guy called me after a month saying he had already transferred the ownership to himself.
I say myself that I am not racist. I don't care whether someone is white, black, yellow, blue, or any other color, as long as they behave as expected in decent society (work, function, do not beat women, and simply have normal behavior).
But when someone comes, reaches out their hand, takes over apartments and houses, has only disorder around them, causes problems.. then it doesn't matter what color they are, but it will bother me.
I do not have a problem with African migrants, as long as they integrate, start businesses, work, learn the language (not necessarily Czech, at least English), and respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, it doesn't matter to me as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will also respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in the Prachatice district.
"Young woman suffered severe multiple injuries and unfortunately died on the spot despite resuscitation care," said Zuzana Fajtlová, spokesperson for the South Bohemian paramedics, to Právo.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was likely traveling from the village of Žíchovec towards the village of Bavorov and for unknown reasons, he veered into the opposite direction while navigating through a bend.
"After colliding with a Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on its roof off the road," described spokesperson of the South Bohemian police Štěpánka Schwarzová."
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
It was multiple injuries, and he remained trapped in the car.
"After being freed, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and in a stable condition was transported by air to the hospital in České Budějovice," stated paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the second car suffered minor chest injuries and was transported to the hospital.
For parcels from countries outside the EU, new rules apply and customers often do not provide the necessary information.
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He primarily purchases collector's cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars and up, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where postage is often free," explains the collector.
Since October, ordering small shipments has become slightly more expensive for him, as he now has to add VAT and provide information to the post office for customs clearance.
He receives an email with the message that customs officials are expecting the arrival of a package.
Then it is enough to fill in the details about the shipment, and if the VAT was not included by the merchant at the time of sale, the customs office will calculate it from the total amount for the shipment and transportation.
In case the recipient does not handle the customs procedure themselves, the carrier's fee must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I will click on one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments, and it's done.
"For me, it's mostly a question of five minutes," Neuheisl says.
However, not all packages are successfully delivered smoothly.
Due to new customs regulations, the daily number of packages received from abroad at the international post office in Prague has decreased from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, another issue is that people don't respond to requests for information that are needed to complete customs procedures.
Currently, there are 30,000 shipments at the international post office that we need to process.
"If people filled in all the necessary information and did it on time, we would be about halfway here," said Matyáš Vitík, a spokesperson for the Czech Post.
Inflation solution
See the title, how would you propose a solution for the current inflation?
Currently, we are at 9.9% inflation and its further growth is expected.
What do you think the government should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
For example, we see a reduction of VAT on food and basic necessities in Poland, is this a path you would consider?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where it is heading?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, and in my opinion, it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford basic things, especially energy.
How much extra did you get (if you are an employee)?
This year, they gave me a 2% raise in gross, which is a mockery, but luckily I have a similar income from the business I operate while being employed.
Could someone explain to me why proven perpetrators of violence are sent behind bars for as little as 6 months?
This just doesn't make sense to me, how can a court send such an animal behind bars for just 6 months, only for them to do it again as soon as they get out.
"6 months is nothing compared to the fact that their victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect their sexual and overall relationships."
Not to mention that the victim of rape may never recover from it.
Won't this discourage potential future reports of rape victims?
A man from Hrob "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat.
A man from Hrob unintentionally helped the guards to apprehend his nationwide wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, who had a warrant for her arrest.
He called her himself.
He went for it, but by a roundabout way.
First, he approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After being called to the emergency line, the guards arrived at the scene and were surprised when the alleged "robbery victim" informed them that he made it all up just to get the guards to come to the location.
In fact, he just wanted to ask the guards for advice on how to report to the Czech Police.
During the identity check of a man and his girlfriend, the guards found out that the woman was on the list of wanted persons in a nationwide search, and there was an arrest warrant issued for her.
The case is being handled by the Czech Police.
Honest question for the people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
Personally, I am of the opinion that Slavs are no longer ethnically or culturally distinct, but I am interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with the meme, too bad Churchill didn't manage to secure the liberation of Prague by the USA :')
Of course, I don't deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can truly believe in something completely without evidence just because it could potentially bring benefits.
I personally wouldn't consider such a case as true faith.
I cannot agree with Pascal on this, as there are an estimated, if I am not mistaken, around ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should a person choose?
I would say that it is quite probable that in one of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you harshly if you believe in a different god.
But even in the Ten Commandments it says that there is no other god but Yahweh.
Would it not be more rational in such a case to refrain from believing in any god, rather than risking that I choose wrong from those thousands of gods and the one true god that I just missed will send me to hell or some similar place?
Different: Voluntary training with subsequent placement into reserve.
The Swiss model is similar, I believe.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If a person performs well, they can receive a professional offer.
All components of the Czech Armed Forces would find something like this useful.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defense.
We can talk about it like this: cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being discussed, companies are hunting for talent in schools and there is some overlap, where the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, we move from one field to another, etc.
A similar overlapping should work between the civil and military sectors.
I perceive it as a way to build a certain relationship between the citizen and the military, which is an institution that guarantees that Russia, Germany, or even a Mongolian invader will never invade here again.
I find it funny how you consider NATO as something carved in stone. We have allies and they will defend us if there is any trouble.
Please the Lord.
"Just one election in the USA that will screw up their budget and the whole NATO goes to hell."
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown once that they are content to turn their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that works as a long-term guarantee of independence is a heavily armed military and a population that knows how to operate the military technology of their time.
And today, every teenager can pilot remote-controlled devices, so why couldn't they do it?
We don't need border fortifications, it's useless nowadays, but a skilled teenager with a remote control device can handle it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami.
You unwrap the gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're overwhelmed at home with boxes and packing materials?
E-shops reuse this "waste" as packaging materials if they lack them.
Therefore, a map of stores has been created that welcome your used boxes.
And not just during Christmas.
"All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling."
That's why it's a shame to treat them like single-use waste.
Anyone can, by mutual agreement, bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillers to the involved store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map includes nearly 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated, and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
Stores themselves welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as saved money, as the price of packaging cardboard has increased by 50% in the recent period.
To environmentally conscious customers, I additionally strengthen my brand in their eyes.
One of such shops is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco-friendly toiletries and cosmetics.
Individuals bring boxes and packing material to us in Popůvky near Brno, which they accumulate at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collections of discarded cardboard.
We will use everything for packaging shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we are collectively creating a more considerate world.
"Our desire is to preserve the resources and beauties of nature for future generations," says Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz not only shows collection points for packaging materials.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to dispose expired medications, tires, outdated electronics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All waste can end up in the right place, and reusable items can find their second home.
Overall, the project map contains over 100,000 such places.
"Gradually, collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charitable shops, SWAPs, and other places are being added to it, which help find a use for things that would otherwise become waste," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliďme Česko association.
I rather think it is bad that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use computers or phones only play games on them, without learning basic computer skills.
Recently there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that college students do not understand the principle of components on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple photo applications or mobile phones in general simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and place everything on one screen in the application.
Let them use technology since childhood, but most importantly, let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU ahead of the weekend -which begins in January- and it was magnificent.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he revealed the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many activities that they cannot be accomplished in half a year.
But French politicians like it and even voters like it.
Macron's supporters, who straddle between the right and left, agree on very little, but precisely on Europe.
And in France there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned among other things that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create conditions for such work by historians.
Several commentators rushed to criticize that Macron's aim is pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, this is rather an attempt to rewrite history to defend.
The far-right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is currently touring France with the message that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not as bad as it is made out to be, and he is having some success with French voters.
Let's take Macron's idea for a history textbook seriously and not pay attention to what's happening in France.
Was it necessary?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story of "us versus them" and never as a story of a whole.
The Spaniards, French, and Czechs are learning who defeated whom in which battle.
However, if they do not have an enlightened teacher, they will not find out what the broader context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?

Anthony Hopkins was named the Best Actor in Berlin for his role in the movie The Father.
I am not very young, not very healthy/fit, and not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being cramped". I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't really fancy smoking...
It was worse than the common flu.
I do not have diarrhea with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I don't claim that everyone has it like this.)

Trains are starting to operate according to a new timetable, and in some places, there will be changes in transport providers.
From Sunday, trains will run on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some routes, such as between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet begins to operate instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time is adjusted, and sometimes their route is slightly modified.
Dozens of new trains will also be on the tracks.
Transport companies started selling tickets already during the autumn.
Czech Railways plan to operate an average of 6783 daily connections for passenger transport in the new timetable, of which an average of 478 will be long-distance trains.
Trains will cover approximately 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
Trains alongside domestic connections within the new timetable will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, and Switzerland.
The company will deploy dozens of new trains together with the new timetable.
The main news will be the InterJet trains, which will run on the routes from Prague to Cheb.
Further new trains of the carrier will run in northern Moravia or in western Bohemia.
The transport operator will also traditionally increase ticket prices from next year, on average by 3.2 percent.
The railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of the R23 line from Usti nad Labem to Melnik, Nymburk, and Kolin.
The carrier will replace Czech Railways here after succeeding in the Ministry of Transport competition.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 trains daily on the route, eight in each direction.
Further changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will from Sunday also stop at stations Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia, and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to the spokesman Emil Sedlářík, the carrier tried to maintain the most similar departure times for their long-distance trains, despite the planned service interruptions.
The operation of trains by Arriva and other transport companies should continue without significant changes.
The transport operator will also be changed in some regional routes.
Changes are waiting for passengers, for example, in Českolipsko, where Trilex trains from the German company Die Länderbahn will be operating instead of Czech Railways on the route from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk.
Passengers will be able to use a unified ticket on railways for the second year as well.
Just like with Czech Railways, their price will increase by inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Don't we learn to see the other side's perspective?
Everywhere we hear about how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil, dying.
In my life, I have never heard teaching from the perspective of slave-owning or from that time; no one defends it, only condemns it.
No one will even tell you in schools that black people often sold each other into slavery and that they were often the worst slave traders.
No one will teach you in school that colonizers often bought land from Native Americans, everywhere they will just tell you how brutally we Europeans exterminated them, while they had been killing each other for a long time.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly in schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern ones.
I have not encountered anyone intentionally suppressing facts, but I have heard before that it happens and I believe it is a problem, I do not deny that (for example, atrocities from WW2 are quite taboo in Japan).
My point was rather that history is not black and white, and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective without understanding it.
History is not interested in anyone's feelings, it simply is what it is and I believe it is a fatal mistake to condemn without considering the circumstances from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, since we are talking about those southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and famous slaveholders are quite popular there. On the other hand, they also had some good achievements and it seemed absurd to me to reject them entirely.
Furthermore, the North was not much better than how many people idealize it nowadays.
And many people also forget that not all in the South were slaveholders, and many things were also opposed by them.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, intentionally omitting certain facts, lying and manipulating, in addition, our perspective may not exist for them (there was even a video on YT from TV where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found funny in US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
Overall, I felt that at some universities it was terrible, the students were quite radicalized, and the schools often supported them in that.
And when I imagine that these people will one day be much older, it makes me feel a little sick to think that this could be the voice of the majority, because they are among the young and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that, for example, feminism has already achieved what it was supposed to a long time ago, and it is no longer about the same thing; it has become more radicalized.
Currently, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological facts are being called feminists, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and this leads to radicalization even on the opposite side, often causing resistance even with quite reasonable things.
Additionally, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I also haven't encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I guess I've met with bad geography, but it was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't achieve on my own?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality overall to be unnecessary in terms of personal identity.
If something connects me with people it's interests, views on the world and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
"I am not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak."
That Slovak priest is a really cool guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always screws up something about the coronavirus, which makes everyone embarrassed.
Then there is, of course, the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernism and are effectively Catholic without the Pope.
"I know a lot of people who are Catholic but attend services at the Hussites because it is theologically very similar, but the members are mostly more liberal."
They have a beautiful and historically valuable functionalist church on Botanická street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael on Dominikánské náměstí belongs to the Dominicans and they even hold a Latin mass there every Sunday at 3 PM, as it was done before Vatican II.
The Flame of Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts have taken it over from Austria.
Břeclav - The little flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to the Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Due to the pandemic of coronavirus, the scouts did not travel to Vienna even this time, but in the morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the border crossing of Reintal - Břeclav.
They took him at the border last year too.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in with our troop every year, and I am really looking forward to it.
"It is an honor for me to have been chosen," said Girl Scout Amálie Budíková to the present journalists.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, this year it will take place at the Reintal – Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, the scouts travel by train to Vienna for him.
There are no changes in the distribution of the flame across the Czech Republic.
Traditionally, scouts set off by train with the Bethlehem light first to Brno, where they hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
Scout couriers will take care of delivering the light on Saturday, December 18th, traveling on selected express and personal trains.
The local scouts or volunteers will take the light from them at the stations, and then they will continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic, even to places where the rails do not lead.
This year, scouts must comply with existing measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
It's happening similar to last year.
"We are giving recommendations to both courier teams and organizers of local events to wear masks, try to maintain distances, limit the number of people, avoid singing with others, and behave in a way that is as safe as possible," said Zuzana Hrbková, spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light, which travels across Europe, was born in Austria in 1986.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship, and harmony along with the flame.
The Bethlehem light is a symbol of hope and light that overcomes darkness for believers.
In the Czech Republic, scouts have been taking care of its spread for over 30 years.
The event relies on hundreds of volunteers, and the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human solidarity.
All news, including the list of places where people can come for a flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
"I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I don't think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem."
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare, and education will make proper use of those funds, I just don't understand why the money is being given to agriculture, industry, and companies in general.
As mentioned, it produces an unnecessary product and disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company."
I work in a factory where there are millions of signs on the corridors saying "xy financed/co-financed by project xy", and such a company is only artificially kept alive.
This is not support for a company that provides work for X people, this is a hindrance to development, as this company is barely holding on and taking orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Complete agreement, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person born in the Internet age falls for some tricks or traps - especially advertisements.
I personally think that internet ads don't affect me, but then I still get caught by them and realize that they have influenced me. It's just so well-crafted that a person can't always resist it.
For that reason, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to impose a complete ban on programmatic (targeted) advertising.
It's all garbage, to quote a classic - I would ban those internets.
I have a feeling that this faith has roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe something just because the majority believes it and it makes sense. I am not a sheep. Instead, I would rather believe something that is less probable and doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion, which I will argue is critical thinking."
2. "I won't believe everything the media say, of course."
3. "I don't trust politicians."
Television has fallen out of the trend of Christmas movies, this year there are two hundred premieres.
Los Angeles - Cinemas, television stations, and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have embraced the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will premiere a record-breaking number of over two hundred for their viewers.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb film database.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic movies has been popular among audiences in recent years and significantly increases viewership, therefore more and more of these films are being produced.
This year, four times as many Christmas movies were made than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database, however, only included in its count those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so in reality there will be many more holiday movies.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are particularly associated with this period, while globally popular are, for example, movies such as Home Alone, Heaven Can Wait or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946.
The true boom of Christmas movies, however, started only in 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark came up with a special series of films, as reminded by the BBC website.
Her advent project called "Countdown to Christmas" included four movies and was very successful.
This station started preparing its viewers for Christmas as early as October 22nd this year and will present a total of 42 Christmas movies.
The competitive station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on their program this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the overall total.
"In this magical season, the story doesn't matter as much, what's important is that there are plenty of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," jokingly described this genre Brandon Gray, author of the book about Christmas films called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
"For viewers, it is a form of escape and a way to at least for two hours feel a little bit of peace amidst all the holiday madness and the madness of the world that we have been living in for the past few years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, the Hallmark television channel still uses the same recipe for its movies which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there is some misunderstanding that arises about half an hour before the end, but it is successfully resolved and those two kiss.
"It's always like this, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch them one after another," adds Gray.
Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not participate in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will head out for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not participate in the last race of the season.
Haas team will send only one Formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack for a better position than the 20th place he earned in qualifying.
Russian driver Nikita Mazepin from Haas team will not eventually participate in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He was positively tested for covid-19.
On the starting grid, only nineteen cars will appear, with Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher starting from the last position on the track, while Max Verstappen, who will compete directly for the title with Lewis Hamilton, will start from the first position.
Mazepin is reportedly fine according to Haas team and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically healthy because he was asymptomatic.
"Now she is in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all parties involved," her representatives stated for formula1.com.
Haas will not send a substitute driver to the race, nor can they do it.
The potential substitute would have to complete a qualification or race in another part of the weekend.
The first racer is not dealing with Covid-19.
At the start of the just-ended season, Kimi Räikkönen had Covid-19, and Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.

From a legal perspective, Covid is on the list of infectious diseases.
So in the same group as HIV, plague, hepatitis or typhus.

d) If such an act causes serious harm to health.
By depriving the offender of freedom for three to ten years, if they cause serious injury to the health of at least two persons or death by an act mentioned in paragraph 1, the offender will be punished.
(4) If the perpetrator causes the death of at least two persons by the act listed in paragraph 1, he/she shall be punished by deprivation of liberty for a period of five to twelve years.

"Gold, silver, and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze you!"
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator has put six months of work and all their savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never really worn much at home," admits Liban, who spent 3000 hours working on his project over six months.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France, and the Swarovski company supplied 2000 decorative crystals.
Then he decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The foundation is wool and cotton, but silk adds softness to the sweater," praises the creator his work, which he does not recommend washing.
"And there's still one catch."
"I'm completely broke, I need to sell the sweater as soon as possible", admits Liban.
If successful, it will create a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

You can argue that the money from those subsidies could be used better, but that's a completely different discussion.

The government approved the dispatch of up to 150 soldiers to assist Poland.
Engineers, explorers and drone pilots could set out before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help their Polish colleagues with border protection with Belarus and the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO countries in connection with the several months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with a false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Is the Omicron variant spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene checks another case of a child from Adamov.
"We currently have another suspicion reported of this variant in another child from Adamov, from a preparatory class."
"Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov Elementary School has not been proven," said Ciupek.
Six cases appeared in the region during the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses at the State Health Institute in Prague," said the director.
She added that it concerns two nurses from one department of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old students from the Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the cases of Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms according to the director, four have an asymptomatic course.
Nobody suspected of Omicron travelled abroad.
None of those mentioned traveled abroad, nor did anyone from their families, and there was no contact with anyone who would have been staying abroad.
"The connection with the water polo championship is not present for anyone listed," stated Ciupek.
The chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously stated that the international water polo tournament, which took place in Brno a few weeks ago, is being investigated.
There were also players from South Africa on it and one Belgian player got sick after returning.
California will limit the sale of guns.
Wants to proceed like Texas with the ban on abortions.
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to introduce a ban on the sale and manufacturing of certain firearms in the most populous American state, using a legal mechanism that Texas employed in its controversial law against abortions performed after detecting an embryo's heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to compensation when suing anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles or homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's statement was a response to Friday's decision by the US Supreme Court to uphold Texas' abortion ban, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent ruling that established the right to abortion throughout the US up to about the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court did not decide on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue that arises from the innovative construction of the measure.
Enforcement of the ban was, in this case, transferred to the public, which prevented Texan Republicans from attacking it through the usual legal process.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) decision of the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the retention of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," said the Governor of California.
"If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He reportedly tasked his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the Minister of Justice to take measures that would authorize representatives of the public to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
This is how homemade weapons are labeled, which do not have serial numbers and can be used to bypass regulations.
Newsom wants "citizen privacy" to have the right to demand compensation of at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) and legal expenses from anyone who would manufacture, distribute or sell assault rifles, ghost gun components or kits for their production in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these dreadful weapons off our streets is to create a threat of private lawsuits, then we should do exactly that," said the Governor of California.
The AP agency points out that California banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons for a decade, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to really reinstate the ban using the Texas template now, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who warned in a dissenting opinion to Friday's majority verdict against expanding the legal mechanism to other American states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant complete immunity to the Texas abortion ban against judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue with lawsuits against selected officials in the Southern United States state.
Every emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, during which the vaccination schedule is gradually determined and the vaccines themselves are improved based on the results.
For example, there are already large-scale studies in Israel on the effects of 4 doses.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a fivefold increase in antibodies, which has the long-term effect that you mentioned.
Simply like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule over time, it's just too early for that now.
Another fact is that soon a new vaccine should come on the market, based on an inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises up to 10 times greater effectiveness.
Just leave the quantity of the material.

However, this does not include the UEFA Champions League.
I think that O2 offers Champions League, but I don't want to change my TV and internet provider.
Poland has threatened to stop payments to the EU budget.
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would act in violation of the law if it were to use its new powers and halt the payment of funds to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan regarding the use of 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism enabling the withdrawal of EU subsidies from countries that violate the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU by vetoing in all matters requiring unanimity," said Ziobro, the leader of the small party Solidarity Poland, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its obligations in the EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stops its contributions to the EU.
"It would be justifiable considering that the EU unlawfully denies us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute," added the Polish minister.
His party takes more radical positions on EU accession than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes made to the Polish justice system under Ziobro's leadership are endangering its independence and subjecting it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is setting "impossible conditions because its goal is not a rule of law state, but a change of government in Poland".
"Warsaw is facing a 'political dictatorship carried out by blackmailing and attempting to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles,' said Ziobro."
He stated that Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on partnership between sovereign states, not on the rule of the strongest or the Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never agree to such concessions from Brussels that would result in Poland's sovereignty being restricted.
"We will never agree to have Poland's status as a colony," he declared.
But understanding it... At Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, I also came across one yogurt multiple times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I gave up and asked.
They had it, that's true, in that narrow sector were all the selected, less common, and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetable and lactose-free zone...
If I manage to avoid it, I won't go to any supermarket anymore, whether there's a sale or not. The golden shop on the square might not have as wide a selection, but they usually have everything I need and it's well-organized, so I can get everything done in ten minutes.
I would take a vacation to Lidl. (Note: This may not be a complete or accurate translation as the sentence is missing context and may be unclear.)
And I absolutely don't care anymore.
For two years, I've been watching how data is being handled here like manure, most vaccine opponents are just a little more out of touch than most vaccine supporters.
"Although rational discussions at a professional level take place, only extreme views make it into the public space."
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Ban everything, allow everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples and pears.
"This state is like this, and we have it like this."
But nobody addresses the fact that the methodology of data collection is different in those two states.
Ugh, I feel relieved.
Sorry for the outburst and I wish you all a nice day.
I was punished with a spoon in my childhood.
It was never about the grades, it was mostly about me repeatedly refusing to listen and acting up (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I have never been punished without warning, my mom always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get a spanking (sometimes even after being caught again, she just brought a cooking spoon and laid it down for me to see).
Only then, after repeatedly refusing to listen, I received a few spanks on my bottom (over my clothing).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (when done reasonably and appropriately) are beneficial because a child responds to them much more than to words.
In my opinion, the important part is the warning section, because it gives the child a choice whether to disobey and face punishment or improve their behavior and avoid it.
For me, in the end, a warning was usually enough to start listening.
System defense
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl was asked by journalists in 1999 what the Czech constitution meant to him - whether it was a sacred document that people swear by and learn about in school from a young age, or rather an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he definitely leaned towards the first perception.
Once we agreed in the institution on the democratic rules of our life, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to be sparing with changes.
And imagine this: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs love dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl once commented on the issue.
Recently, however, the opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs some changes has been increasingly prevalent.
Years have been tested with situations that their creators (among whom Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not have predicted, such as the behavior of the directly elected president.
In one thing, however, Cepl was right.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions into their texts must be deliberate.
The institute needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to mastering the majority of crises that societies encounter throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of governance consisting of individual rules that establish boundaries for politicians' actions.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we restrict politicians with prohibitions.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid doesn't choose, in the Brno University Hospital they are fighting for the life of a few-month-old baby.
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder in children, there are also severe cases, which hospitals are mainly grappling with in recent times.
"We know that children are less threatened and affected than adults, with figures ranging from 2 to 5 percent in comparison to adults," said Petr Dominik, Head of the Department of Paediatric Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Faculty Hospital in Brno and the Medical Faculty of Masaryk University, to Novinky.
The course is usually significantly easier, lighter, and often goes without symptoms.
"However, there are pediatric patients who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which we have seen especially in the recent period," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
This takes place at the clinic for children's infectious diseases.
Truly very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently in the ICU.
Children with post-COVID syndromes were continuously treated on the ward throughout the whole year according to the doctor.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute Covid pneumonia, which means inflammation of the lungs, requiring hospitalization in the intensive care unit," he said, adding that this disease affects not only adults but also adolescents and even several-month-old infants.
There are also children in a serious condition due to coronavirus in hospitals.
"At present, we have a several-month-old child as well as an adolescent in our care," said the head physician.
However, it is joyful that so far no child deaths from coronavirus have been recorded at the Children's Hospital of the University Hospital Brno.
According to available data, there were six deaths of children aged 0 to 14 in the Czech Republic as of December 6th.
According to Dominik, a psychologist is an integral part of cooperation in the children's hospital - not only in the coronavirus department.
At the same time, it also points out the fact that just like with adults, vaccination also mitigates the course of the disease in children and simultaneously reduces the incidence of post-COVID syndrome.
"Therefore, we also recommend vaccination doses for children," added the doctor.
In the calm zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But those quiet zones are not that big.
They are visible on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
Generally, in national parks outside of quiet zones, you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over fences into the game reserve).
Skiing/riding a bike in the forest outside marked trails is prohibited everywhere unless you have an exception (but of course, it's not heavily monitored outside of national parks).
How does a conductor rehearse?
"The music is playing in my head," laughed Josef Kurfiřt.
He was weaned on the Liberec opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer, he can practically sing any repertoire and as a conductor, he works not only at the F. Šaldy Theatre in Liberec but also, for example, at the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre in Plzeň.
Collaborates with the Hradec Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic, or the Sub-Krkonose Symphonic Orchestra.
China is building an impression of having mastered the infection and that its authoritarian regime is better handling the crisis.
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building an impression of successfully managing the pandemic and that the authoritarian regime is better equipped to handle the crisis.
China launched a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago Beijing faced criticism for not being able to control the outbreak that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero increase in infected cases.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against coronavirus in many places, for example in the hardest hit Italy.
How to perceive the willingness of Beijing?
Is it a friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets another friend and says to him: "hey, do you want an elephant?"
I have him and he is great.
The wife is happy because she enjoys eating grass, washing the car with a trunk, and playing with the kids.   (Note: This translation does not make much sense as the original Czech sentence appears to contain some grammatical errors or unusual word choices.)
Just fantastic.
If you want, I'll sell you the elephant for 5000.
Friend: Alright, let's do it, it will be great...
After some time, they meet and the one who bought it complains: Dude, what kind of elephant did you sell me???
The lawn is trampled, giant piles of manure everywhere, the car is broken down, the children are afraid of it, and the wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold it says: "You speak rudely about the little elephant, you won't sell him like that."
World affairs are dominated by superpowers.
Although the equality of sovereign states is valid, it is precisely the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can only become such a superpower if it works on its integration.
This one currently works at an economic and political level (in selected issues), but military integration is still missing.
Personally, I think that Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the moods will be different and it will succeed.
It also occurred to me and it's quite possible.
I am not an expert in Czech, so I may be nitpicking with words.
I am assuming that an ellipse usually includes 2 different units on the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and mandarins", where it is clear that both are from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is no longer clear that the mandarins are from Spain.
Furthermore, I base it on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces" including their weaponry and I know that American complexes are operated solely by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in that broad term and there is no need to further specify it for American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just nitpicking :D
Whether it's one way or the other, it's an absurd request.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the monkey named Milly.
The terrifying footage shows the moment when a frightened monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it and laughed at it.
The Hollandová monkey was also fed hot dogs, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The Magistrates' Court in Gwent has now banned her for life from keeping animals, informed The Sun.
Experts in rehabilitation of monkeys who care for Milly after her abuse have declared that they have never seen a frightened primate like her before.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation with the workers of Monkey World in Dorset and now she is happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
A mother of four confessed to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was sentenced to twelve weeks imprisonment with a suspended sentence for one year at the Magistrates' Court in Gwent.
Hollandova was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a lifelong ban on animal breeding, and must pay 12,000 crowns in court costs.
Steph Sawyerova, the leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, said, "Milly is okay, but the rehabilitation will continue further."
Milly took some time to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The little monkey refused to eat for a long time.
And now, even though she settled down and is content with her mate, the sight of new people can still cause panic in her.
Sawyerova says that the psychological scars from the abuse will accompany her forever.
Milly's torture was revealed after the police in Gwent discovered horrifying footage on her phone during a raid on her apartment for drug charges.
In the footage, you can hear Milly swearing vulgarly.
In the next video, you can hear Holland offering cocaine to a monkey saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
So, lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to possessing cocaine with the intention of selling it.
Czech: V jejím domě byl nalezen kokain za 1600 liber (v přepočtu necelých 50 tisíc korun) ukrytý v Kinder vajíčkách. English: Cocaine worth 1600 pounds (equivalent to almost 50,000 Czech crowns) was found hidden in Kinder eggs in her house.
Czech: Cox byl následně uvězněn na 30 měsíců a Hollandová dostala podmíněný trest 20 měsíců. English: Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Hollandová received a 20-month suspended sentence.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from three times in prehistory when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
"Are you going to take the same things to first grade as you would to sixth grade?"
And the whole thing is killed by the idea of memorization when nobody, with few exceptions, cares if you can do it or understand it.
Mainly write the test for a "1" (highest grade) and then nobody cares anymore.
Go out and randomly ask people on the street if they are able to determine the nature of the roots of a quadratic equation and its coefficients.
Everyone went through it, and the absolute majority won't even flinch and will tell you that they don't give a damn.
"So what the f**k is he/she learning for?"
I am a big fan of general knowledge and the fact is that people don't want or need it.
And at that moment it's pointless and you'll never get it to them anyway.
Partially, it is learned for the many people who will need a particular thing.
But as for the remark that you don't really need all this when standing at the machine, I meant it absolutely seriously... ...because you simply don't need it.
In addition, we are slowly entering a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(Which is probably also influenced by our communist past and instigation against intellectuals and elites) However, the cost of having barbarians standing with us at those machines is simply too high.
If for example journalists could count, then COVID probably would have never reached these dimensions here.
Love at first sight: The war between Kadri and Andrea continues!
"That's the main reason why Switzerland can't leave right away," Andrea replied on Instagram stories to curious fans' inquisitive questions about what disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social media.
Between Kadrim and Andreou, it was squeaking from the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move with him, or at least until he returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she firmly refused.
And as it can be seen, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
"It was a planned attack by you!" Kadri exclaimed in response to Andreina's accusations of lies, gambling, and debts.
Kadri's alleged honesty did not please his ex-wife or his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally, I don't comment on these things at all and even in my family, we never really talked about these things too much.
I definitely don't want to evoke any remorse.
But when I see someone trying to harm and tarnish the name of someone I love so much in public, I just can't stand it!
I am sorry that I have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for making himself into a person of character and helping our family when we needed it most, despite his young age.
It saddens me even more when I have to read such untrue information which is probably taken out of context.
I wish everyone, our loved ones and family, knew Kadri like I do, standing in confession in reaction to Andrey's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
"Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the truth and know how things really were," she added vaguely.
A drunk thief climbed up the façade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Chao began his robbery expedition in a residential neighborhood parking lot, where he attempted to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole less than 330 Czech crowns from one vehicle.
Then he came up with nothing better than climbing to the 5th floor and entering the apartment through an open window.
He stole two bananas over there.
In the footage from one security camera, he is then captured walking down the street away from the scene of the crime while eating a banana.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he realized that the bananas were not where they had been, and called the police.
"Then Cchaa detained us."
The man admitted to drinking some alcohol on the incriminated day.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob while drunk.
The whole matter is still under investigation.
The drunkard climbed up the façade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and its effectiveness is tied to a state of pandemic readiness.
When it is cancelled, the law will not be effective.
The law limits the scope of business.
Is that not enough of a reason for you?
The right to assemble will be limited, but not abolished.
Over 60 percent of voters participated in the Saturday elections for the councils of four municipalities.
New councils were elected by people on Saturday in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherské Hradiště, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec, and in Rovná in Pelhřimov.
The number of councilors in these municipalities has fallen below the legally established number or the elected councils have disintegrated.
99 candidates competed for a total of 28 mandates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected councilors is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a fairly demanding, but successful year for us.
According to the vice-chairwoman of the Czech Statistical Office, Eva Krumpová, a total of four new or repeated elections were held in local representative assemblies and, most notably, highly-watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place.
She reminded that due to the Covid-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and staff security.
The Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's elections in Komni in Uherskohradišťsko, gaining 27.76% of the votes and two seats in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate list received 24.84% of the votes, which also means gaining two mandates.
"Two seats in the council were also obtained by Občané pro Komňu, with 18.52% of the voters giving them their vote."
The current mayor of the municipality, Jana Křižková, who is a member of Soukromníci, was also re-elected to the council.
The inhabitants of Komňa - independent candidates - have achieved one seat in the municipal council.
Turnout was 75.48 percent of eligible voters.
In the village of Rovná in Pelhřimovsko, the association Pro Rovnou won.
It gained 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 have entered the municipal council.
The voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in Lusatia on Mostecko were won again by the Association of Lusatia and Svinčice led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It obtained 56.73 percent of the votes and, just like in 2018, it holds four seats in the seven-member council.
The second place went to the candidate list "Obec pro lid", which received 43.27 percent of the votes, so they will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters came to the urns.
Independent candidates of "Hope for Nová Ves" won the elections in Nová Ves in the Liberec region, defeating the ANO Movement.
"For the association of independent candidates, 59.88% of voters voted, thus obtaining four seats in the seven-member municipal council."
YES received 40.12% of the votes and, compared to the regular elections in 2018, gained an additional mandate and now has three.
The voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the election results.
Then they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign policy?
"I think you already know all this that people are writing to you here."
You are just pretending to be foolish so that you have someone to argue with.
If not, then it is sad.
"I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that."
Actually, I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was ultimately the goal, for them to look good).
And I really don't care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I am bothered by how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it accumulated, and the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it caused, for example the Thirty Years' War.
TL;DR: Believe in the spaghetti monster if you want, but the state and the church have nothing to do with each other.
The man fell head first from twelve meters.
Survived a collision with concrete.
A man in Ostrava survived an incredible fall on Sunday night, and was assisted by the rescuers of the regional Medical Emergency Service.
Workers at the regional operations center received an emergency call with initial information about a man falling from a height an hour after midnight on Saturday.
Two emergency medical service crews - medical and healthcare - immediately proceeded to the location.
Upon arrival at the scene, the medical professionals found that a 27-year-old man had fallen from a window at a height of approximately twelve meters and landed on his head on concrete!
Coal was extracted in Vitkovice.
But not as it should have been, and firefighters went into action.
At the moment of the arrival of the emergency service teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate danger of dying.
The attending physician intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and, after further pre-hospital emergency measures, an ambulance transported him to the further care of the Ostrava Traumatology Center, said Lukas Humpl, a spokesperson for the EMS of the Moravian-Silesian Region.
I have greater concerns about the inadequate reactions of the public and authorities than about coronavirus.
The spread of coronavirus in Czechia represents a challenge for politicians and officials, but in the front line of the fight against the infection are primarily doctors and healthcare personnel.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the championship belt.
MMA had an awesome gala evening full of interesting results.
At UFC 269 tournament, things were happening.
Outsider Julianna Peňová managed to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who had not found a conqueror for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in the lightweight category, he displayed great choking against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
Kai Kara-France also recorded a victory as he quickly swept Cody Garbrandt with a technical knockout in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
Surprise that no one expected.
It brought a women's bantamweight fight between renowned fighters Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pena.
The American entered the mutual battle as a figurative "dwarf," as Nunes has not lost in seven years and was itching for another triumph.
The beginning of the duel was also characterized by the spirit of paper assumptions.
"Nunesova started her journey towards victory very actively and even inflicted a push kick on her opponent, which sent her to the ground."
However, Peňová did not allow herself to be forced into any further mistakes and unsuccessfully attempted to attack with a lever to the hand herself.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents treated themselves to plenty of excellent strikes and hard hooks.
"Peňová knocked Nunesova down to the ground and started choking her."
She had to give up the effort and tap out.
The American caused a huge shock to everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
"At first, Poirier was doing better, but gradually the tables turned."
In the second round, Oliveira tried to be more active, attempting to defeat his opponent with an armbar.
While he didn't succeed too well at first, he then created a lot of pressure and got his opponent on his back, and showered him with a series of blows.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira demonstrated a rear naked choke, which was resisted by Poirier for a while, but he eventually had to tap out to the choke.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier, on the other hand, lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley scored a dominant victory, already in the first round he used a hard right backhand on Raulian Paiva.
Subsequently, he finished him off with a series of accurately aimed strikes and recorded his fifteenth victory.
Kai Kara-France was able to handle Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, but now after seven years, she lost.
That hip, or this hip?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech language express only one grammatical gender, and therefore it is not difficult to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or neuter.
Then there is also a relatively large group of nouns for which gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When declined, they acquire two different endings and in some cases remain in the non-declined form.
For example, the words "svízel" or "kyčel" are of both male and female gender, the former being declined according to the pattern of "stroj", and the latter according to the pattern of "píseň".
For another group of nouns, there are different forms even in the first singular case, such as: "řádek/řádka", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "brambor/brambora" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are standard, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is informal, similarly with other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih" and so on.
Some words that have entered the Czech language from other languages were originally indeclinable, but gradually they adopt Czech inflections.
A typical example is the term "image", which is masculine and feminine, or the word "bufet", which remains uninflected in the neuter gender, but has suffixes in the masculine gender similar to the word "hrad" (castle).
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation like directly on the Greek borders?
Tension is high at the Greek-Turkish border due to the increasing number of migrants attempting to move further into Europe.
Thousands of people started to travel to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped blocking them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to take the uncertain journey?
And what does the situation look like directly on the spot?
"We haven't seen blue sky for three months and we were suffocating," describes the journalist from Sydney.
Destructive wildfires that Australia has been struggling with for almost four months have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and residents coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government do more to prevent drastic impacts, as critics argue?
And what will the Earth have to prepare for in the future in relation to climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová is talking to journalist Ika Detrichova from Sydney.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
For people, it's unpleasant to deal with how sexual violence looks in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to cover it up.
I personally do not know anyone who has been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have witnessed how their surroundings or even the police often behave towards these people.
Victims should always be believed.
It has become a trend that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But still too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are also those who falsely accuse someone.
It is utter disgust and a spit in the face to all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large portion of accusations are fabricated" and that it's a "trend", you are only helping sexual offenders.
Czech Republic is being flooded with unfinished houses, families don't have money to finish them.
The prices of building materials have increased by more than 30 percent in the past few weeks and months.
Many people got into a difficult situation because of it.
She doesn't have the means to complete the partially built family houses and banks are refusing to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of materials, the price of construction work is also increasing.
People do not have enough money to finish already under construction family houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move into partially constructed and uncertified houses.
"In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay the mortgages and rent," says economist BHS Štěpán Křeček.
We will build two to three family houses in a year and we have achieved this in fifty percent of cases.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult because we have to adhere to certain contractual obligations even if the material has become more expensive.
"So we are working without profit," said the owner of the construction company, Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people will only start having financial problems.
If they were counting on the fact that the construction of the house would cost five million, now it will cost seven.
"I think some will wait," added Slivoň.
Czech: Z materiálu nejvíc podražila měď, železo a také instalatérské a topenářské vybavení. English: The most expensive materials were copper, iron, as well as plumbing and heating equipment.
Construction companies are also struggling with a shortage of labor.
In the Czech Republic, there is a shortage of graduates in construction trades and the influx of foreign workers is slowed down by the pandemic.
At this moment, the situation regarding issuing building permits is the only favorable one.
"The building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than last year," clarified Křeček.
We are doing well and we will have even better.
"Real visions are missing," says commentator of ČRO - mujRozhlas."
Entrance into the new year was traditionally accompanied by political speeches alongside the usual celebrations.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and Chairman of ANO Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message from President Miloš Zeman, the Chairmen of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also spoke to the nation.
What significant information did we learn?
I feel great about my thesis because I have my own chosen topic, and I am building on my bachelor's thesis. I work on it throughout the year, and then I write the written part in a week or two.
State exams are completely calm here, as long as a person is not a total idiot and has something left in their head, the commission will not unnecessarily suffocate them with theory.
For example, I studied for my state exams for a week and when I was struggling, the committee always tried to guide me towards a logical deduction that would immediately click with me and I would have the correct answer.
Regarding those projects, I know people who will pay someone to do their semester project for them (we've done it many times, it's really beneficial and teaches a lot) and then they just learn that project and have it done.
In my opinion, it's great when there's an exam at the end of a subject that reflects the knowledge gained through a project, not just a defense.
Everything is okay, but do not overwhelm with emails and phone calls and do not send any packages to the embassy.
You will be the same jerk as they are.
Those people at the embassy may not have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can also put a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of the Winnie the Pooh.
"Maybe give it to him in such a way that it would slap Xi Jinping on the buttocks or something like that."
I agree, even though Instagram throws sticks in the way of artists.
If you don't post stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will decrease to an absolute minimum.
Additionally, it keeps changing which function is more important, whether it's a like, comment, or saving.
"Recently, it's been bothering me a lot, so I may have to resort to TikTok, where many artists in my industry have success and they swear by it."
In the end, I might even be glad if something more user-friendly came along that doesn't suck all creativity and energy out of artists.
Declaration of the Party of Workers on Donbas
Union - yes, breakup - no, express their opinion on the photo opponents of the breakup of the USSR.
Thirty years since the illegal dissolution of the USSR.
On December 8th, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind occurred.
On December 8, 1991, in the Bialowieza Forest, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk, and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum from March 17, 1991, with the open and indulgent attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard to the people, signed an agreement stating that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
With one stroke of the pen, they "abolished" a huge country with nearly 300 million inhabitants.
With the dissolution of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens ended up abroad.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Even without taking into account the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in both world wars combined!
Earlier, the same people who in one sitting in the Belovezhsky forest destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created by the price of millions of lives lost in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately carried out deindustrialization, slowed down agriculture, and separated fourteen republics from the world's largest power, which were previously economically connected in a single mechanism.
If we want to look deeper, we can see impoverishment of the population, economic collapse, decline in science, army, increase in crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, NATO expansion to the east, the war and breakup of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all of this is the result of geopolitical surrender, first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is a term in political science called "power vacuum".
Everything that was hastily surrendered and given away was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries, which accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken mainly due to the events from the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a high-turnover supermarket may not directly correspond to its quality and value.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK per kg.
I will buy it with the intention of putting it into the fridge and making dinner out of it on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, where I don't buy meat on Monday and the chain lowers its price to 99 CZK/kg on Tuesday, describe to me the mechanism by which this meat's price change becomes a burden for my digestive system?
Or should I wait until Thursday when the meat will be reduced to 69 CZK/kg, one day before the expiry date - how would this meat differ from the one I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more and left in my fridge for 3 days?
I will answer to myself - by nothing.
These talks about how when something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled, or low-quality are terribly stupid, to tell you the truth ;-)
Recently, I was walking in Brno at Hlavas and in the underpass, girls were handing out some brochure. I always take similar things to help the part-time workers because they can't throw them away.
No, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but there was nothing about God. I was confused, but I suspected that it was some kind of propaganda.
After finishing reading, I found out who published it and in the end it turned out to be Scientology.
"Well, he was a good guy, full of completely unnecessary advice, like how I should wash myself and not be a jerk."
Paper wastage, forests wouldn't have to be cut down because of this.
I have experienced something similar with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will make you comply with that person because you love them, without realizing how messed up the situation is.
She threatened me several times that she would harm herself because I went out to chat with a friend she didn't like.
Or also when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she started crying and got down on her knees, begging me not to go anywhere.
Then she started to physically block the door.
Approximately a year it was a great relationship, but then another six months passed and she started acting crazy.
Afterwards, I ended the relationship by telling her that we were breaking up and by lying to her, but that we could still talk about it next week to calm her down and so that she wouldn't go crazy again.
Such a person sucks out your feelings, emotions, and overall joy.
Prefer to keep distance.
When insurance companies fiercely steal by purchasing tons of tests and rushing to the positive cases who wouldn't even know about the terrible disease without the test.
The only thing we are achieving is complications for companies, transport providers, and others, because their employees have been randomly assigned five days of house arrest in the number generator.
In the West, they have already stopped with that foolishness and recognized that it is not worth dealing with an illness weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and still needs to steal something and boost his ego by inventing derogatory remarks.
I see that the old good scoundrel is returning to us again.
After several years of decline and suppression of this shady business, MLM recruiting is returning to the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at college), the initial promises of training in products and business skills quickly translated into "you don't have to care about that, just find people."
Honestly, I was interested in the products I offered because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare and convince someone.
When the first earned money came, a person quickly realized that in order to earn, they must market several certain products every month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, so a person felt like a door-to-door seller of pots.
But what can I say, it was a valuable experience, one learns that they should not jump at every opportunity and should thoroughly verify information.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump everyone together.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to others, but they definitely won't boast about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" bank account.
In the corporation where I work, I haven't experienced many things like that.
HR is calm, managers mind their own management and do not stick their nose into anything.
Regular evaluation is therefore happening, in a form that works quite well for us (set some goals for the next year, we will look at what worked and what didn't after a year) - it is more of self-evaluation, rather than someone evaluating you based on some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes one feels like we are almost a startup, squatting in the offices of a large corporation, you know.
But it works so they don't bother us much as long as there are results.
The Czech woman missing in Britain is deceased.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, the British police searched without success for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the Minister of Foreign Affairs in resignation, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social media that a woman from Uherské Hradiště was found dead.
The British police this afternoon unfortunately confirmed to our embassy in London that they have found the body of the missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regards to the family, we will not disclose any more information about the case.
"Sincere condolences," Kulhánek stated on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28th on a bus on her way from work. Before boarding, she had to withdraw some money from an ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by her colleagues from work five days later.
Afterwards, the London police began to search for her and Interpol listed her as wanted all over the world.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police have already arrested one man in this regard several days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what he is suspected of, but she did not disclose it.
In four municipalities, new municipalities were elected to the end of the year.
On Saturday, December 11, new municipal councils were elected in the villages of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region, and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of councilors in these municipalities has fallen below the number established by law or the elected councils have dissolved.
In the new elections, 99 valid candidates applied for 28 mandates.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men obtained a mandate.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
Thirteen candidate lists were registered for new elections to the municipal councils in the specified four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for 28 representative positions.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest was 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a fairly demanding but successful year for us.
Four new or repeat elections to municipal councils took place in it, and above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies were held.
"We mostly had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security," evaluated Eva Krumpova, the 1st Vice President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 03:49.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the results of the voting and, after approval, they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a rather dangerous infectious disease here at the very beginning, but it went without major obstacles.
Dealing with how idiotically a large part of the population at all levels approaches it, I still have a problem with that.
I am most looking forward to getting vaccinated (tomorrow!) because thanks to it, I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not jerks.
He would be relieved of the function of the president and of the ability to regain it again.
The chance that it will really happen is, as others mention here, very small.
Additionally, I am not sure if the destruction of the file could even be considered as treason.
Treason is an act by which the President of the Republic endangers sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who have been celibate for a whole year is increasing.
More and more young adults in the USA are living their lives without sex.
It mainly concerns religiously oriented people, says the DailyMail newspaper's website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under the age of 35 who abstain from sexual life increased from eight to 21 percent.
The number of women aged 18 to 35 who reported not having had sexual intercourse in the past year is higher than ever before.
A survey conducted by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) has shown that other factors also contribute to a decrease in the number of sexually active individuals.
One of them could be the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher unemployment rate.
But the presence of media, social networks or video games, which make sex a smaller and smaller priority for young people, could also have contributed.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who reported not having had sex in the previous year has been growing rapidly," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Sexual activity is more frequent among people in marriage, with only 5% of them reporting being without sex in the past year as of 2021.
Among unmarried people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
A decrease in sexual activity is also contributed to by fear of premarital intercourse and religious beliefs.
Although there is a greater likelihood of sexual activity among married couples, the percentage of married women under 35 is still decreasing.
Young people are divided in their opinion on premarital sex, with about 30% considering it a bad thing, while approximately 70% think it is okay.
"It is true that among single individuals in this age group they are a minority, but their behavior is shifting this trend," Stone speaks about these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is rooted in religion.
Since 2008, among unmarried individuals under the age of 35 who attend religious gatherings more than once a month, the ratio of abstinence has increased from 20 to nearly 60%.
"Among the 'less believers', the trend has increased from 10 to 20%," said Stone.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and, above all, reduced social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the likelihood of having sex is lower among people who are unemployed or have lower income.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thereby "replacing" this need.
"This trend caught on mainly during the lockdown in the time of the coronavirus pandemic."
The entire ordering of vaccination against COVID-19 is about whether society should compel a portion of the population to behave in a way they don't want to but which may save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, and what personally interests me the most is the question of social conscience.
That is, for example, the question of whether if we don't order them to do it and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could definitely be responsible for the death of an eighty-year-old person who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it to him well, he heard some misinformation and as a result didn't get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we are responsible for the death of a stubborn opponent of vaccination who is screaming about bullying and a totalitarian state alongside the SPD and KSČ here.
From the statistics that I mentioned, it can be reasonably inferred that the majority of unvaccinated retirees probably belong to the second group, so they will truly be responsible for that themselves.
Czech: Česko bez sněhu. English: Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times.
Ski resort operators cannot do without technical snow, the weather also complicates the preparation of the Jizerská 50 cross-country skiing race.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will a lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I do have one story, but it's not about a religious zealot.
Once in high school, our teacher took us across the entire town to the boathouse so that we could take a boat ride on the river.
On our way there, we walked once along a fairly wide street, and guess who we didn't see in the middle - a follower of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they collapsed on us.
I fortunately escaped, but I started talking with one friend.
"When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she told them."
"They asked me if I want to save my soul."
"I told them that I don't have a soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the boathouse.
We are terribly spoiled.
"Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing," says Orozovič.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after his previous visits to Paris and Brussels, flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where he was greeted with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in our mutual relations," said Morawiecki at a joint press conference after the talks.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must jointly express that it will not accept violations of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, should be resolved using diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normandy group", which includes France, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine, according to the chancellor.
Morawiecki stated that he informed the Chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially provoked a migration crisis and is using people as live targets and weapons, as we are recording hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border every night.
He discussed with the Chancellor about further sanctions to finally make Lukashenko's regime and his patrons in the Kremlin understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
According to the DPA agency, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in its dispute with Belarus and condemned Lukashenko's regime's inhumane treatment of refugees.
Drunk Polish nun caused an accident, tried to cover it up.
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but it was already being driven by a different nun who was trying to take the blame for herself.
"When the police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for failure to give way while driving and leaving the scene of an accident, she told the truth," stated TVN24 station.
She admitted that another nun crashed into her vehicle and asked for her help.
Then the police came for Celestina's sister.
They subjected her to a breath test and after finding out that she had over two per mille of alcohol in her blood, they immediately confiscated her driver's license.
At the same time, they informed her that she would confess her deeds in court.
The dog Hugo is doing what he can.
Juraj Šajmovič didn't watch over his film.
Czech family comedy creators drew inspiration from American stories about beloved dogs.
But they forgot about an essential thing: the laws of filmmaking.
After the kitschy film by F. Brabec, Gump - a dog that taught people how to live, now another movie called Here We Are Watching is vying for audience emotions in cinemas.
The co-author of the script and the director in one person, Juraj Šajmovič Jr., loosely follows up on his previous film "Here I Watch" from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some familiar characters around him are returning to the stage.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a Šumava guesthouse that is declining, start inviting dog owners to it, including Julie's father with his partner and above all their daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl but a teenage girl who is experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the film's producer) struggled with narrative techniques in their previous dog movie, but at least children and the dog were entertained.
This time the creative duo wrote an even weaker screenplay that evokes a mixture of awe and embarrassment.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, despite being a scientist, succumbs to dark delusions in her desire for a child and, when the right "constellation" occurs, copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates may lead them - on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course, during a local guide excursion). Retired Colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the woods, causing her to fall into a coma, whereupon she is taken to the hospital by her family, so that a miraculous healing process with a dog can take place in the heart of the Šumava wilderness.
Nothing against the cleansing power of nature and the love of animals.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer is amazed by what a jumbled mess of unreliable situations and characters was necessary to convey this message.
A pair of female thieves from the staff, a dog handler competition, a charlatan from Šumava, police officers coming to search for "drugs" based on a report, and a discussion about the fertilizing power of bone meal while using herbs - and all of this is what the tipsy family in the pension will inevitably talk about.
When the heroine wakes up from a heavy coma and immediately sits at the family table with curled hair and makeup, smoking a cigarette and demanding her father's whiskey and meat as a cured vegetarian, it's impossible not to laugh.
On top of that, the creator will explain to the audience that "it sometimes happens after a coma."
The team of Šajmovič lacks fundamental dramaturgical knowledge regarding working with text, the ability to construct meaningful situations, a sense for character personalities and punchlines, as well as directorial guidance.
The performances of the actors are uneven, the editing is ineffective and the overall impression is messy.
No matter how much Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to keep their party afloat, they don't have much to play with.
The only positive aspect of the movie are the poetic shots of the Šumava nature captured by cameraman Vladimir Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to outline a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog catchphrases, let alone more vulgar expressions that the characters commit.
Being a longstanding member of the Dachshund Breeders Club is not an argument - as is the case with the producer lady.
For good intentions to promote nature and friendship between man and dog, one must also have knowledge of the craft if they wish to tell a believable story.
It didn't work out in this case.
There is a bit too much eroticism and a minimum of sentiment for the genre in a good family photo.
Even as an advertisement for canister therapy, this amateurishly conceived piece wouldn't pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to constantly listen to insults from fools like you.
"There is a difference between offering and forcing, and it is evident here that you don't understand that at all, but that's just because you have never tried it."
The decision is always up to the customer, if they don't want to, the answer will always be no.
If you kept listening to such kid all the time, you might change your opinion.
It's just a job like any other, in this case a part-time job for extra income.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as recorded at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israeli Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
The two-day rain from this week was rather an exception.
For us, it is good.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
"It is also the right Christmas setting," rejoiced the resident of Nazareth, Wasim Ashkar.
Precipitation in Israel mostly comes in the winter months, it is sporadic and irregular.
Forests are dependent on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It's not just about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, became filled to the brim this spring due to the three last rainy winters.
Since then, the water level has been decreasing.
The water management experts had been warning about drought for a long time.
"It can be expected that depending on global warming and climate change, there may be a decrease in precipitation here," said Uri Schor, spokesperson for the Israeli Water Authority in 2018.
Israel knows how to use technology to help itself, such as desalination or recycling of wastewater.
Economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the capital city of Jordan, Amman, there is an increase in tanker trucks.
Water mains and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the previous two years," reported Imád Sulejman, the driver of a tank truck in September.
Clashes erupted between farmers and security forces in Isfahan in Iran.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The channel of the local river has completely run out of water.
The region has just experienced the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military intervention against Iran.
The Israeli defense minister declared that the talks in Vienna have brought "no progress" and that he has informed Washington about preparations for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz declared on Saturday that he has ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, as reported by Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is staying in the USA, is trying to persuade Americans to increase their pressure on Iran, but he also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna have not brought "any progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them".
About 3 years ago, the same thing happened to me too.
I liked the girl a bit and grilled her during the conversation to find out what she really wants from me.
Finally, I found out that my suspicion of a pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these deceptions, I kept questioning and doubting the young lady for a while and eventually thanked her and left.
Feel free to tell me I'm a scoundrel, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers headed to the mountains over the weekend, with plenty of snow and nice weather waiting for them.
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major surge of skiing enthusiasts this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have consequently started their operation.
Even the obligation to provide a covid certificate did not discourage the downhill skiers.
While ski lift operators are not complaining about customer disinterest, some ski equipment rental shops are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people headed to the cross-country skiing trails and downhill slopes in the Liberec region over the weekend.
The skiers enjoyed the weather which offered sun and excellent snowy conditions today.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend went really well, starting from the Friday evening skiing, where we had the first skiers on the hill," praised Jakub Hanuš, director of the Ještěd Sports Area for the interest.
Hundreds of people headed for the first weekend skiing of the new season to Jeseníky as well.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branné in the Šumperk region were open.
The weekend attendance was very decent, approximately 400 people came on Saturday and today.
The conditions are superb.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, and the representative of the ski resort in Branná, Rostislav Procházka, was not sparing in his praise.
The operators of ski resorts can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or within a period after recovering from COVID-19.
"Except for rare exceptions, people are prepared for it and prove it with necessary documents," René Hroneš from Špindlerův Mlýn ski resort told ČTK.
"We have only recorded a few incidents," he added.
Some ski rental and equipment stores are reporting lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
"It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers," said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava store in Opava.
A greater influx is expected during the ski courses period.
Also, David Šinták, the director of the Snowbear company in Hradec Králové, feels that due to Covid, there is not as much interest in renting skiing equipment as there used to be.
At this time before the pandemic, we were almost overborrowed.
"Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent," said Šinták to ČTK.
According to him, people have become lazy during the pandemic and have learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, the rental service in the Novako area in Boží Dar is experiencing great demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago and interested parties already have to order them in advance.
"We will start renting cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we are expecting a high demand, just like last year," said the operator of the area, Pavlina Novakova.
According to her, there is comparable interest to the period before the epidemic in ski school.
If we want successful and wealthy people to not leave for abroad, they must have the opportunity to experience a quality life like abroad.
Certainly not included in this is socialist healthcare, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or specialist doctor.
Smart and skillful people who have no property leave for abroad.
The owner of the company won't just leave to go abroad.
I completely agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a prospect of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary started when Orbán won one beautiful day, ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from one day to the next.
The next question is about elections at all.
If life here is bad, then some traditional V4 lunatic can also win here.
The young and educated will leave, supporters and people whose property cannot be stuffed into an airplane will remain.
Scary photo!
"Langmajer's blood for a bet over a beer?"
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the film crew of the movie Ostrov led by Jiří Langmajer (55) was enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor meanwhile published a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a genuine injury, or is it just a portrayal for filming purposes?
The London police is still searching for a missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on the way home.
"The disappearance of Petra is completely unlike her behavior and we are beginning to be very worried about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in the Lambeth district where Srncova worked in Saturday's video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work at around 7:45 pm on Sunday, November 28th and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was allegedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by someone from her colleagues on December 3rd.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nurse assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"A healthcare facility group stated in a tweet that we have great concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing."
"We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Public called for cooperation also by MP Harriet Harman, who drew attention to the case of Srncova at a press conference on Saturday.
“She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried sick,” said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I have a feeling that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find it, because she was away from her homeland, away from her family, and she worked here for our healthcare," said Harmanova.
The police previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the news website BBC, however, the police did not provide any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTGs (i.e. approximately 5 divisions).
I do not underestimate Ukraine either.
That is not "huge quantities", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and they are starting to have enough of our entry.
"I quoted above."
I don't know what made you assume that Russia wants a war.
War is damn expensive fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparison to the situation in 1938 is so different in many aspects that I don't even know where to start.
"Now I can compare it to the first Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D"
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it does not intend to adhere to the Minsk agreements, Russia will annex those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" at the borders would correspond to.
Well, agreements must be kept...
New timetables have been in effect in Prague since Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections.
Passengers using Prague Integrated Transport (PID) will face several changes from Sunday, especially relating to suburban connections.
New routes have been created, some have changed their route, and others have been discontinued.
The Mladá Boleslav region is newly integrated into the system.
Starting from Sunday, express trains from Ceske Budejovice will stop at Zahradni Mesto station in the capital city.
In suburban train transportation, trains S7 will depart, which pass through the Prague main station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The newly established station Praha-Zahradní Město will have a new stop for the express train R17 from České Budějovice and Benešov.
PID will be newly expanded into other areas.
Among other things, buses will go all the way to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatná near Jesenice, Staré Splavy, and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladá Boleslav region, including routes reaching into the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions, will be included.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones will be introduced, and the operation of 12 existing ones will be modified.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Zličín in Prague and will go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovnik has also been established, replacing the canceled train line S53.
There will be reinforced connections during the morning peak and on weekends from Prague to Rakovník, with a newly launched express line number 404.
The bus lines 400 and 410 going to the Liberec region have been newly included in the PID system.
They depart from Střížkov metro station, not from Nádraží Holešovice station.
The backbone line 400 runs through Mělník, Dubá and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The supplementary bus line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubá to Doks, Mimoň and Jablonec nad Nisou.
On the contrary, the operation of local trains on dozens of lines in the Central Bohemian region has been canceled or restricted, including those to Mochov, Dobříš, and Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.
All trains departing from Prague at 2:30 have been cancelled.
Due to modernization of the railway, there are long-term restrictions on the Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and Kolín area tracks.
Changes also await passengers in other places.
Buses replace some cancelled train lines or expand sections on line 420 from Dobříš with connections from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets all the way to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen region have been adjusted.
Healthy snack/lunch for the office from the supermarket.
Hi, I work a classic 9-5 job with a 30-minute break, and my only option for getting food is to go next door to Billy's or a little further to Lidl.
"Since I don't have any physical activity, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthily and dietarily as possible."
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry, I buy at most pizza, buns, and for snack yogurt and apple.
Question: What healthy food without the need for cooking would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately that's how it is.
And it's not about the trees that you necessarily have to see.
Only the top of a tree can hide under the snow.
If it gets damaged, the tree can be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I don't claim that it's the only reason why they forbid us to ride off-piste, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn't looking forward to this at all.
The Czech showbiz pond has been alive with nothing other than the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd since Friday.
They have been together since the summer, the famous football player even divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to her fans explaining why she hid her love from them for a long six months.
"I dare say that currently there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who doesn't know that Dara caught a bear, sorry, Nedvěd," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
They say he packed her, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they do not enjoy it.
And here it is.
"What we both didn't look forward to but knew it would happen eventually," the singer continues.
I just don't know who is worse off.
Whether it's those who are not interested at all and it pops up on them even from a can, or us, whose lives are dissected in detail.
As if someone wanted to hear your opinion on whether you and your spouse or girlfriend/boyfriend are a good match, or if you insisted that everyone really knew in detail the list of your former partners and were familiar with the enumeration of your mistakes and flaws.
"That's obviously a beetle, do you want it? Does it bother you, Dara?"
The couple got together in Italy, where Rolins went for the preparation of her new fashion collection.
Nedved has been serving as the vice president of the football club Juventus for a long time.
They only came out with the truth now because they were waiting for the completion of Nedvěd's divorce.
Ivana and her husband have been separated for three years already, although they are legally divorced only for three weeks.
In any case, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We are not perfect, but I believe that we both have our hearts in the right place.
"And that's why I love my new husband and just as he stands by me, I stand by him. In good times and bad, Rolins has stated."
Hello, the other commenters have probably said everything essential already, I just wanted to confirm that the dorms are great for the beginning. Most of my classmates made friends and found roommates during the first semester or two, which seems like the best option to me because you know who you will be living with.
Apartments usually do not advertise very far in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it certainly won't hurt to look at the offers.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl but also the surrounding areas (streets such as Vranovská, Francouzská, etc. - that's a pretty bad address), some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is heavily populated by students, Královo pole and that way is great, besides it is close to most of the faculties at VUT (I don't know exactly where you're getting on).
I've never looked for a rental myself, but I'm a native of Brno, so I can advise on Brno as a whole if you still need any information :)
That is an example of completely "normal" thinking to me.
Because of what some doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it's actually perfectly fine that the state doesn't sufficiently finance some schools.
Either let them learn what they want and pay for it themselves or let them follow the state's guidelines and pay for it through the government.
We cannot let a private entity take over a part of the education system just because they add a few extra dollars to get full government funding and then teach whatever they want in the schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who expressed himself in this way about a petition action for boycotting a totalitarian state just two days before:
So, is a vote against someone having an abortion the same for you as a vote against having a statue in the square?
I would consult directly with the person who gave you that task if I were you.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloging/digitization that (even long-time professionals) either estimate it by eye or write something like xxx *** or... (according to convention) and note that it is illegible.
Truth is, in this case, it's quite readable, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend against it entirely.
Personally, I would deal with it in some kind of note depending on what program you are using.
If you wanted to be a proper and diligent student, you could look into some sign language databases and find the closest one.
But because it looks like you're drawing from some book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created their own symbol that corresponds to what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it rather the Odry Empire (Kingdom) than OdryNská?
P.S.: Someone has already figured it out here.
Look at that comment with ΦΙΛH.
Politicians have no idea what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
That's a much worse situation than just having interpreters with you.
The idea that something would be approved simply because nobody understood a certain text is amusing.
All important approved documents are examined word by word, and basic knowledge of English is not enough for that, that is the job of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions. English is more suitable for politicians for informal relations and establishing above-standard relationships.
Moreover, with this English language, it's quite interesting after the UK's exit from the EU.
"I don't understand that hatred towards Cejl."
"For the third year now, I have been working there and it's completely fine/chill."
How many times I go home from work at 10 pm and never any problem.
Only someone who has hardly ever set foot there in their life can say that it's a ghetto.
Yeah, most of the Roma population in Brno lives there, but the only thing they do is obstructing the sidewalk and parking where they shouldn't :D It's definitely not like I would be afraid to go out on the street there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively affordable housing with good accessibility to the city center, then I would definitely go for it.
Many apartments there are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda or girlfriend Gelemová is like a post in a fence!
With whom will you spend Christmas?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
"I have seen Daddy's wreath and I am sure Lucie has one too," said the saxophonist to Blesk, confirming Patrasova's words that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady where Dáda stayed alone after his departure.
Slováček still doesn't know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
Recently we got together with Anička, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we kept talking, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I will be.
I buy gifts continuously and I will definitely purchase something for Dáda and Lucie, probably perfume.
"I am a gentleman," said Felix, who himself came to the baptism of a music video in Richman club.
I am here alone, but I don't feel alone.
"I always find someone to have fun with," says Slováček, who was glad to have met Luďek Sobotka's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová."
And he made it clear.
And are we Iceland, so that we can afford not to have soldiers or weapons?
"I doubt that anyone will defend us and our location is so strategically important that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory."
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, could you please explain it to me?
I don't know any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in crisis.
"There are too few police officers and they cannot afford it, the same goes for firefighters and there is no other place where so many health-trained people are at such a high level."
And the fact that our army is only able to defend Ostrava is a damning indictment of the previous governments, not the army itself, which has been pleading for new equipment for quite some time now.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
"It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not just be a factory for food," says a journalist."
The Czech Republic is going through the worst period of drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountainous and sub-mountainous areas; even places where there was previously no shortage of moisture are experiencing less rainfall.
The cause of the drought that is prevailing in a large part of Central Europe is climate change.
But the way we cultivate the land also strengthens the impacts.
What to prepare for in relation to drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Well, that's how it's going to be. I can hardly maintain my balance on ice skates, and I don't even know how to play hockey. The tactics I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager are insane as well.
And whether you are a hockey team "Bear Russia" or "Lama China", losing by two goals even if you don't have to win the match at all costs is different than when it's tied.
But anyway, listening to Czech commentators who point out what the referees do or do not pay attention to in both men's and women's hockey, it's all strange, but that's probably the case with every sport, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
In my opinion, if it were the other way around, it would be like always, and that Czech Republic has more often lost than won against Russia, it would probably be a classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: Number of infections in Russia surpassed 10 million.
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
There are 5766 people hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people have died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
There were 1967 confirmed cases per 100,000 people in the Czech Republic in the last 14 days and 871 per 100,000 people in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It is the lowest daily number since October 13th.
The total number of registered COVID-19 cases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, which is the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" big wave of infection caused by Omicron, said Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for the British Health Security Agency, on Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be necessary.
People infected with Omicron are already being hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their numbers to rise.
So far, no one has died of Omicron, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after infection and deaths occur about three weeks after infection.
The leader of the British Labour Party, Keir Starmer, stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson likely broke the law by organizing a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December when a lockdown was in place and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister from Johnson's government argued that the quiz took place "virtually," through a computer.
However, groups of employees gathered around computers participated in it at Downing Street.
Pressure is increasing in Britain to remove Johnson from the position of Prime Minister.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were prohibited, Johnson's ministers organized numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are outraged that Johnson and his government made a mockery of them.
Paul Brand, the editor of commercial television ITV for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a resounding majority in the general elections.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the position of prime minister.
Remarkable how quickly events unfolded.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting spring elections, which could end Viktor Orban's twelve-year government.
These will be elections of pan-European significance.
How much can we expect them to be fair?
They will not be fair.
They probably won't be free either, as the last two elections under Orbán were not free either.
His party Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to benefit from it, and does other smaller or bigger tricks.
The latest one for now sounds like everyone can choose, in practice, where they want to go.
This will allow Fidesz to transport voters from decided precincts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So, I'm just repeating that they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be equally unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
But the situation is significantly different.
It used to be about how much Fidesz will win, not whether they will win, and if they will also have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that the united opposition will gain more votes and mandates.
This is a big novelty for Viktor Orban and his party.
Won't they play even harder in an effort to maintain their power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are willing to go beyond what they have been doing so far.
Recently, a recording of the Speaker of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, was leaked to independent media outlets. In the recording, Kövér tells the heads of secret services that the opposition poses a threat to national security.
Are those the indications of the new approach you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of the news/updates.
Everything begins with language.
I was beaten quite often, last time at the age of 14. My parents, especially my mother, don't have much patience and neither do I. My dad can be patient for a long time, but then he explodes extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and used to get very angry when I was little to the extent that I would lie on the ground in contortions and be all bruised; they probably had to shower me twice to calm down.
Sometimes they disciplined me, but sometimes it was more like they didn't know what else to do.
Definitely, I also have tendencies to solve things with violence now. When I was little, I used to fight quite a bit, but now I at least hit something to let off steam. And when I was younger, I would sometimes slap my parents' hand (so I wouldn't get smacked on the butt too hard), so it was never anything extreme, but I always feel the urge.
I am not able to determine to what extent it is caused by my explosiveness, but certainly my upbringing also has its share in it.
I'm afraid that I'll also lose patience with my children and handle it the same way.
"I think that hitting children is simply wrong and that my parents should not have done it, especially not at the moment when it was not for disciplinary reasons, but out of frustration. However, perhaps every parent messes something up with their children, it is probably not possible to avoid at least somewhat damaging them, so I don't blame them for it."
It doesn't offend me, I don't understand why OP should be ashamed of something.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call the ones who create laws in such quality "Kundas".
Otherwise, I was wondering if you're afraid of a power outage?
Can you really expect that people want and buy your product and you will have money to pay off your mortgage?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will the process with the murderers of journalist Kuciak move Slovakia?
The main trial of the four defendants accused of the murder of Jan Kuciak and Martina Kusnirova begins in Slovakia.
The death of an investigative journalist and his partner changed Slovakia.
She mobilized the civil society, but also exposed the practices of the accused entrepreneur Marián Kočner and his connections to the elite of Slovak politics and justice.
What significant turning point will the process mean for Slovakia?
Journalists are responsible for this enormous thing.
How is it possible that this petition received orders of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition by deans of all medical faculties, which was published one or two days later?
No, they let themselves be fooled and society paid the price.
People were dying from COVID on Czech television even half a year ago.
Another government ends and the law on involving municipalities in the selection of a storage site is nowhere.
The proposal of Minister Karel Havlíček needs to be fundamentally revised.
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is at its end and the law, which was supposed to ensure the respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and licensing of a deep repository for highly radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government has interrupted the discussion of a proposal that was submitted to the Government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities grouped in the Platform Against Deep Repository, but also with the Association of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Local governments expect a significant strengthening of their decision-making powers regarding the storage facility, as promised to mayors since 2011 when the first work on this legislation began, which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will collaborate with municipalities to revise the proposal.
The municipalities criticize the proposed bill by Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform mainly because: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process for selecting a site for a repository is insufficient and cannot ensure the respect of the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
Truly effective can only be when municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given location at all.
This can be ensured by storing the obligation of the Repository Administration to request the consent of the affected municipalities before initiating a specific procedure.
The submitted proposal of the material intent almost completely neglects public involvement and turns citizens of municipalities practically into mere statistics during permitting proceedings.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensations for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a location for a repository, its approval, and operation.
Representatives of municipalities realistically do not have too many options according to today's legal standards on how to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a location for a storage facility.
Only in some permit proceedings can they submit their comments or appeal, but the decision is made by the authority or minister whose interest is to issue the permit.
Any potential lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on carrying out exploratory or construction work.
The co-decision of local governments, which is requested by the Platforma, is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries, particularly those that have advanced in permitting storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
Preparation of the law is, in addition, another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms for the preparation of legislation.
In this case, it concerns a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and is related to contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The overall sum for these works according to the contract registry should amount to almost 4 million crowns.
Antonin Seknicka, the deputy mayor of the village Cejle from the locality of Hradek and the spokesperson for the Platform against the deep repository said: After the ministers of industry who only postponed the alignment of the position of local governments towards state authorities in the search for a deep repository of highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant change from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand with that.
We also thank the Union of Cities and Municipalities for their support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental construction similarly to the directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The Platform against the Deep Repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) to promote a change in the state's approach to dealing with spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to just deep repository.
The platform further advocates that the decision on selecting a location for potential storage be subject to prior consent from the affected municipalities.
John Goodman, aged 69, was forced to lose weight due to fear: He lost 90 kilograms.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, doctors eventually scared him.
They told him that if he doesn't lose weight, he will die.
And it worked.
According to The Sun, Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg.
He showed off his new character at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers in Los Angeles.
The person from the sitcom Roseanne who played the overweight character is a completely different person now!
John liked to joke that his friends and family asked him to lose weight because his large body was causing furniture to break.
" I put everything into my mouth," said the actor in 2018 in an interview for AARP.
This time, I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
"I am reaching an age where I can no longer afford to sit still," said Goodman to ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss and in what context you want to use the word "boss".
If it's about any text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were, for example, a formal and perhaps university-level text, I would probably look for ways to describe or explain the boss more.
There are various types of bosses for everything.
For example, a game like Dark Souls and others have several bosses, right, and so a "boss" is something like a lord/ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss), which are not necessary to defeat in order to complete the game or level, but often they are even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player does not directly fight them (such as Tentacle and Gargantua). Can they be called bosses at all?
And then there are mini bosses.
It is simply impossible to translate the word "boss" into a single word in Czech or other languages. Interestingly, Catalan is one language that translates "boss" as the "final opponent".
It is simply significant for a story or game, computer-controlled opponent stronger than all previous ones, guarding the completion of some level or task in general.
The whole world is searching for the missing Petra from London.
Even the Czech police got involved.
The British police have been searching for Petra Srncova who has been missing since December 3rd.
Even the Czech police got involved in the search.
He has been searching for the 32-year-old woman from Uherske Hradiste since December 7th.
Through Interpol, it also helps the British police.
Czech citizen Petra Srncova was last seen by her colleagues on November 28th.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow notice because of her.
The whole world is searching for Peter.
"Czech police closely cooperate with the British police," confirmed police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
"We share information about the case together," she added.
The search for Peter has already been announced on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, slim, and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
She should come from Uherske Hradiste.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the hospitals in London.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, as such disappearance is very unusual for her.
Harriet Harman, a local MP, also joined the search for Petra.
She got involved in putting up posters with Petra's face.
"We are extremely worried about her," she said at Saturday's press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have arrested one suspect already.
However, it is not clear who the person is and what they had in common with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic is being terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attacks campaigns, last month with the end of the year approaching, attacks significantly intensified.
We recorded a major campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are specifically targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the email should attract the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
"While last month the dangerous attachment was named 'invoice,' this time it was labeled as 'Copy of receipts for repairs for 11,2021...exe,' said Martin Jirkal from Eset."
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials, which are then sent to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of attackers is rising again.
In November, the spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic and security specialists in November rather detected campaigns with global reach.
Compared to October figures, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still accounts for nearly one fifth of all detections.
The attacks were ongoing continuously throughout the whole month with increased activity on the 3rd, 10th, and 15th of November.
The form book most commonly contained an attachment with the .exe extension, which was titled REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name "receipt" continues to appear.
An attachment in Czech can be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
According to security analysts, there has been a significant drop in activity in the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6% of attacks and has not launched any major attack campaigns in the Czech Republic in the past few months.
That demo of smart people today who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated fools.
The parade in Prague was bigger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the procession along the waterfront and my experience with the demonstrators, I am not afraid to estimate around 10,000 people.
The people in the procession filled the embankment, the bridge, and the opposite embankment road.
This means that there are really a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passersby are spontaneously joining the procession of around four thousand demonstrators.
"I claim that something new is being born here," writes Radek Mokrý.
That persistent dissatisfaction among several large groups or classes of the population led to them finding a common language.
Only anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers, and the like would not be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The events organized by the association Chcípl pes are gaining popularity, which reminds me of Milion chvilek pro demokracii turned upside down.
Sometimes I have the impression that they even rent the same stage and equipment.
It's hard to say what movement could be created from this dissatisfaction. It depends not only on the influx of money but also on whether the three-dose Pfizer vaccine doesn't become a four or more-dose vaccine.
It definitely won't be a leftist or centrist movement, bet on that.
A three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, as it is clear that we will have to be revaccinated every six months.
I am very happy that the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant action by scientists, which humanity can rightfully be proud of.
The end of the impasse, Bulgaria has a new prime minister calling for change.
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has entrusted Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement "We Continue with Change," which won the November elections, with forming a new government.
He has already managed to form a broad coalition government, which is expected to take office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
The victorious parties fighting against corruption and abuse of power could not agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
The globally successful footage was taken "secretly".
Over the weekend, concerns were growing in Britain about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who the London police have been searching for several days.
Petra Srncova was last seen two weeks ago when she was commuting from work to her home in the south of the British metropolis.
After information about a worker from a children's hospital, not only the police but also her previous employer or a representative of the London district where she lived are calling.
"The disappearance of Petra is not at all like her behavior and we are starting to worry about her a lot," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in the Lambeth district where Srncova worked, in a video released on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 pm on Sunday, November 28th and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was allegedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by someone from her colleagues on December 3rd.
According to British media, Srncova worked as a "nurse assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the hospital consortium of Guy's and St Thomas'.
"We have tremendous concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," stated a group of healthcare facilities in a Twitter post.
"We would like to urge anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
An anonymous person reported Šumperk's amateur painter of children's rooms, Zdenka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also a regional Pirate Party councilor), that she violates copyright law with her paintings.
The court, however, ruled that the paintings of Krteček in the rooms in Šumperk do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a hole in the road in the form of an uncovered channel for a month.
It was a matter of life.
The city council referred complaints to the Road and Motorway Directorate, which owns the road, and because they allegedly did not respond, the pothole continued to gape.
Finally, the authorities clarified the responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the Road and Motorway Directorate started "intensively addressing the situation".
