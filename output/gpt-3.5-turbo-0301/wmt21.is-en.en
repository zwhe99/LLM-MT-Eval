Shouted to the world
The marketing campaign "Looks Like You Need Iceland" seems to have started well, and calls and shouts out in nature have begun to attract people far and wide around the world.
"You have the skyline, I need Iceland," said a woman somewhere in the big world in a comment on an advertisement from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on the YouTube content platform.
One spectator claims they will cherish Iceland in their heart for eternity and a young woman states she must get to Iceland as soon as possible because her loved one lives there.
However, to all misfortune, she is in the United States and therefore expects to have to wait for some months yet.
Yet another spectator asks if the pedestrian route to Iceland is feasible, because there are no airplanes.
The story does not indicate whether it comes from another time period.
Egill Þórðarson of the advertising agency Peel, who was involved in creating the advertisements along with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says that the reception has been better than expected.
"I have participated in many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign is already setting records."
In essence, this is about creating PR value, which is to get foreign media to cover the campaign, and it has gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short time, we have received coverage in about 700 media outlets around the world, reaching a total of approximately two billion people.
The value of that discussion is estimated at 1.8 billion Icelandic Krona.
"It's not comfortable."
The main market consistently is the United States and the military campaign has been going very well there, even though American troops are not on their way to the country urgently.
According to Egil's account, he was familiar with market areas such as Denmark, Britain, and Germany, which also received him well, as did Russia, which came as a pleasant surprise.
Then there have been reactions from foreign regions, such as India, that were not specifically anticipated.
"These advertisements have traveled far beyond what we expected," says Egill, but it should be noted that over four million people have viewed the content on YouTube.
"We could not have wished for a better start."
The pictures here at the opening were taken by Árni Sæberg, a photographer for Morgunblaðið, during the shooting of advertisements with the headline "Let It Out" in the middle of last month.
The eruptions occurred far and wide, just like on Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavik, at Reynisfjara, near Skógarfoss, on Sólheimajökull glacier, and in a cave at Hjörleifshöfði.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki Petursson and Gunnar Pall Olafsson from Skoti Productions, and the cameraman was Ottar Gudnason.
In the roles of technical support were the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders came to produce the advertisements, but at the same time as the filming was happening in the Southern Region, another group was in the West Region and the Westfjords.
According to Egill, "Let It Out" is only the first step in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, and a winter campaign is planned in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
"This is just the first phase of this work for Iceland's tourism office," says Egill, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone extremely well.
"It is great to work with them."
In such projects, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to.
Sprengisandur: Addressing the situation in the labor market, pension fund, and much more.
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, the minister of social affairs and children, will be appearing on Sprengisand which starts at 10:00 on Bylgjan today.
He is also the Minister of Labor and negotiates the position in the labor market as well as the Icelandair case and other cases.
He also discusses rural affairs and the relocation of work to the countryside, which has been performing poorly and controversial in the past years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, the chairman of VR, will also participate in the segment where he will discuss his criticism of pension fund investments and present ideas about how labor unions and employers could withdraw from managing the funds to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Then there will be a discussion with Ivar Ingimarsson, a travel service provider in Eastern Iceland, and Arnheidur Johannsdottir, executive director of the North Iceland Marketing Office, about the situation of tourism services in rural areas.
"They will look ahead to autumn and ponder whether the success of the summer is a misleading preparation for what is to come."
You can listen to the program below, but it starts at ten o'clock.
This is what she looks like today, 25 years later.
The actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in youth programs of all kinds.
Despite her world fame, she did earn recognition for her role as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
Then she also appeared in the shows Sabrina: The Teenage Witch alongside Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
She hasn't had much going on lately, but she did manage to watch Clueless on Australian television recently.
"She speaks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who unexpectedly passed away in 2009 and says she was a wonderful person."
"I have to admit that I built most of my personality around girls I met in school who were not kind to me."
"As soon as I read the manuscript, I knew who this person was," said Donovan about his role in Clueless.
Didn't want to abandon the police station after the night shift.
About fifty cases were brought to the attention of the police in the capital area today, and the police diary states that the cases were diverse.
The day at the police station on Hverfisgata began with the police having to deal with a man who had recently been released from a prison cell after staying there due to a drunk driving accident.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not listen to the police instructions telling him to leave.
The man stayed on at the police station for a further period of time due to his progress.
Then a man was arrested early in the morning, suspected of breaking into a company in Kópavogur.
The police also had to deal with two men in Breiðholt due to a report of assault.
Then it also happened that a woman who was sitting at a table in a shopping center in Kópavogur couldn't pay for the meal and was therefore called to the police.
Also, there was a report of a car theft in the city center this morning.
A driver of a white Renault van searched for it for a while and then it was taken by an unauthorized hand.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Joy Brigade - Horrible Fate of the Glee Stars.
That theory has gained traction on the internet that a curse hangs over the series about Gleðisveit (The Joy Squad), as the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California recently, becoming the third main actor of the series to pass away prematurely.
The series about the glee club is a popular show about singing, dancing, and joy.
The episodes revolved around a so-called joyous group of teenagers in a high school, their loves, and destinies.
It wasn't always easy to find happiness in the crowd, but through song and dance, the characters of the show seemed to overcome whatever circumstances arose in their lives.
But outside the filming location, great distress has ridden over the actors and staff of the show, so much so that theories have emerged about a curse resting on the productions.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez in the show, a sassy character who didn't always listen to her grandma.
After the television series had run its course, Rivera started dating the actor Ryan Dorsey and had her first and only child, Josey, with him.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her partner, and they separated afterwards.
Dorsey refused to file a complaint and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8th of last year, it was announced that Rivera was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket aboard the boat and he was able to tell the police that he and his mother had swum and then Rivera had brought him back to the boat but never returned himself.
A comprehensive search for Rivera began.
The day after the search began, the police chief in the area reported that based on the search, it was assumed that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially pronounced dead.
It is believed that she encountered heavy currents in the water and used her last strength to save her son.
The cause of death was registered as drowning from an accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the show, the American football player with an angelic voice who played a key role in bringing the Glee Club to success and respect.
Despite the missing pieces, Moneith still struggled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape from it.
In 2013, his collaborators felt that enough was enough, intervened, and urged him to seek help.
Moneith then went in for treatment and seemed to be looking towards better ways.
Just two months after completing treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Bath salts turned out to be a deadly mix of synthetic drugs and alcohol.
It was not considered to be an intentional act.
Moneith had undergone treatment and the tolerance of his body to pain had decreased so much that the dosage he had previously handled well, proved fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he passed away.
His death weighed heavily on his colleagues, but with the support of his co-star, Lea Michele, it was decided to continue filming the show and they dedicated a whole episode to the memory of Moneith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the show. Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow members of the Glee Club, at least until he gained the confidence to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles on suspicion of possessing child pornography.
During a home search at his place, an incredible amount of child pornography was found and the case quickly became public.
"It was clear that Salling had been present." (Note: "búinn að vera" is a idiomatic expression in Icelandic that can be roughly translated as "had been present/there" depending on the context.)
He was charged and convicted for his crime.
He was sentenced to four to seven years of imprisonment, in addition to having to be registered as a sex offender and seek treatment for pedophilia.
Before the judge had decided on the punishment, Salling, who was then out on bail, was allowed to stay close to his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn't just the actors of the shows who died at a young age.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the shows.
He passed away in his sleep in 2013, at only 41 years of age.
In the episode, a woman named Nancy Motes also worked.
She was the younger sister of the big star Julia Roberts and did not have a beautiful story like her sister, but she accused Roberts of great mismanagement and disrespectful behavior.
Motes did not take her own life in 2014, but she struggled with serious depression.
She left a letter for her lover where she stated that her mother and sister, among others, were responsible for how she was treated.
"My mother and so-called siblings will receive nothing from me except the memory that they caused my worst depression."
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of using bullying and harassment towards her colleagues at work and having an unstable personality.
Jesse Luken had a guest role in the episodes in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was considered a big embarrassment.
Actress Heather Morris had a big role in the shows.
She fell victim to unscrupulous computer hackers in 2010 who obtained compromising images of her and posted them on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the shows and were in a romantic relationship outside of the shows.
Benoist later revealed that Jenner had used violence in their relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything.
It increases children's development when they get to play outside in the garden with their parents, to cultivate flowers and follow them grow and bloom.
"It is also endlessly possible to do with flowers as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out."
Just spending time with the children in the garden is something that is never forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the scent, and of course, the precious time they spent with their parents.
Bought a boat after the tenth grade.
"I don't think there are many sailors who work at kindergartens in the country," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who goes fishing in the summer and studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter."
Seashore fishing is a very convenient summer job when one is studying.
If fishing goes well, it is possible to have good income and I find it great to be able to avoid taking student loans.
"The income is also good for me during the winter," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student who enjoys beach fishing in the summers like he has done in previous summers.
Axel had recently docked at Tálknafirði when a journalist caught up with him late in the evening at the beginning of the week.
"The winter when I was in tenth grade, I obtained a skipper's license for boats under twelve meters long and I bought my boat the summer after finishing elementary school."
I have been going fishing on my boat every summer since.
I bought the boat second-hand from my friend, Hartmann Jónsson, and I named the boat after him.
Hartmann had become an adult when I bought the boat, and had stopped going to sea, and he was very happy when he saw that the boat bore his name.
"Hartmann passed away a few years after I took over the boat," says Axel and adds that he bought the boat for three million.
"I made an agreement with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer but the other half at the end of the summer when I had finished fishing."
"I therefore owned the boat debt-free at the end of my first summer on it."
But how was the boy able to come up with one and a half million to pay for a boat after he had just finished high school?
"I had saved up and collected money, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I was fishing with him every summer and got my share."
I also put my confirmation money into my savings account.
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, from where all his maternal family comes, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
"I can fish here in the western region because I have a residence with my grandmother in Isafjordur."
I learned on this area here to the west from rowing with dad.
I travel between fjords depending on how I feel, as this fishing ground covers all of the Westfjords.
Although I prefer to be in the west, I have also traveled around Snæfellsnes and elsewhere.
"I have also caught fish from the south, but mostly grasshoppers," says Axel, who always gets up early in the morning and sometimes talks to the seagulls and sings for the sky, in peaceful moments together out at sea.
"The internet connection out at sea is good, so I can make phone calls, listen to radio shows and music."
I don't mind being alone on a boat.
"Of course I try to avoid getting into danger, but occasionally something has happened, but never a great risk," says Axel, who is fortunate to never get seasick.
He says the length of the workday depends on how the fishing goes each time.
"In shore fishing, I am never more than 14 hours on a fishing trip at once, but I have also fished in other systems, such as the rental quota, where I have continuously been out at sea fishing for one and a half rotations of the sun."
The regulations in coastal fishing say that he can catch 770 kilograms per day, which he finds challenging.
"Other restrictions are that I may not fish on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I can only fish for twelve days a month, during these four months when shore fishing is allowed, in May, June, July and August."
In my opinion, seamen should choose their fishing days based on the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is forcing people to row instead of having 48 days off throughout the summer and being able to choose according to their own preferences.
"So the regional division could also go my way and coastal areas that are well located near fishing grounds should be able to enjoy it," says Axel, who mostly catches cod from the salty sea on his beach excursions, but also a few other species float along.
Axel is working through the winter with his university studies at the preschool Núpur in Kópavogur.
"I don't think there are many sailors working at the country's nurseries," says Axel proudly and adds that he was only planning to work temporarily at the nursery.
"I got stuck there because I think this is a wonderful job."
"I hope my psychology studies will be useful for me at the pre-school level in the future," says Axel, who is also well into his studies in business administration.
An error in registration prevented quarantine upon return.
An error on the registration form that people fill out when they arrive in the country resulted in an individual, who is a resident here, not being called back for a medical examination.
It is not a requirement to provide a social security number if the person fills out the form in English, as it is done when filling it out in Icelandic.
"This will be examined during the week," says a specialist in the field of infectious diseases of the chief medical officer.
Three domestic infections were detected at the virology department of the National Hospital yesterday.
One of those who tested positive arrived in the country on July 15th, two days after regulations on so-called homecoming quarantine took effect.
Those who were residing in Iceland are then tested upon their arrival to the country and are re-invited for further testing four to five days later.
It was announced in the noon news on RÚV that the person in question had, however, followed the old system.
The inspection at the borders was negative and he was not called back for screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, a specialist in infectious diseases at the Chief Medical Officer's office, says in an interview with the news agency that this may be attributed to an error in the digital registration form.
Filling out the registration form in English is not a requirement to enter a kennitala (Icelandic personal identification number) like in the Icelandic version.
It was primarily intended for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person in question has not received an automatic invitation to come for a test.
Kamilla says that many have followed the rules of home quarantine despite filling out the registration form in English, and in some cases, employers have also been vigilant about sending people for testing again after their arrival in the country.
"This will be looked into during the week on how to facilitate people's access to this and draw their attention to the process."
The man is in isolation, and six have been placed in quarantine.
They all go to testing, but two had started showing symptoms.
Contact tracing is now underway for the three infections that were diagnosed yesterday, but it is mostly completed due to the two infections that were diagnosed on Friday.
In both cases, the analysis of Icelandic genetic analysis has revealed that there is a variant of the coronavirus that has not been found here before.
In another case, the links have been directly to Israel even though it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says that tomorrow it should be clear where the virus is coming from.
In total, there are now 15 people in isolation according to the website COVID.is.
135 are in quarantine.
Four out of five infections unconnected.
Five domestic infections have been detected in this country in recent days.
Of those, four cases are completely unrelated and, for example, the origin of the infection that emerged at the Rey Cup sports event yesterday has not yet been identified.
Contact tracing is still essential.
Originally, there were thirty individuals sent into quarantine, but that number was reduced to sixteen.
In total, there are 34 in quarantine because of these new infections that were diagnosed yesterday.
"This is the second time in a short period that an infection has been detected at a sports event, raising questions about whether such events should be held."
Johann K. Johannsson, the communications director of the national police department's civil protection division, says that it is very possible as long as people follow guidelines and rules.
"We are constantly sharpening measures for all those who live here to maintain individualized infection prevention."
We also need to prepare for people who are hosting events that there are certain rules in place that need to be followed.
"Then it is possible to hold an event," says Jóhann.
He says that it is possible to prevent infections by maintaining individual protective measures in the air.
Rules and guidelines should also be constantly reviewed and evaluated.
"What needs to be done, and what the civil defense and the National Health Service are constantly emphasizing to people, is to focus on these individual-based infection prevention measures."
Both at home and also with service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
"It prevents the spread of infection," says Jóhann.
"We need to prepare people to continue on the good path that we were on, in order to maintain the success that we have achieved so far."
40% of COVID-19 sacrificial lambs had type 2 diabetes.
Devon Brumfield heard over the phone how difficult her father had to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical assistance.
The day after, he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden respiratory distress caused by a coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was specified on the death certificate as the underlying problem, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that the same fate awaits him.
The Reuters news agency says Brumfield's fear is not unfounded.
Figures from a new study conducted by US authorities show that nearly 40% of those who died had type 2 diabetes as an underlying condition.
When the proportion of those who have not reached the age of 65 is examined, the proportion increases to half.
A study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) involved more than 10,000 people from 15 countries who recovered from the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease specialist at the CDC, says the results are striking, particularly for those who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.
Was concealed in slow growth. Reuters conducted a survey and pointed out the responses from the 12 countries that responded in similar proportions.
10 states, among them California, Arizona, and Columbia, have not yet started to differentiate underlying diseases.
"Diabetes was already an epidemic in slow growth."
"Now COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful wave," according to Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago, as reported by Reuters.
Diabetes is more common among black people and people of South American origin, who have also been more affected by the coronavirus.
The best defense for those with type 2 diabetes is to keep the disease under control through exercise, healthy diet, and assistance from healthcare professionals.
However, the coronavirus epidemic has made it difficult for many to maintain their routine over the past few weeks.
Then the cost of insulin has been used by some to continue to meet the demands of work and thus avoid exposure to the virus.
Reuters suggests that US authorities may have been aware of the risk the virus posed to those with type 2 diabetes.
When the SARS coronavirus passed over in 2003, roughly 20% of those became ill, and during the swine flu epidemic in 2009, this group was three times more likely to require hospitalization.
When MERS made itself known in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to the ICU had diabetes.
Scientist at Yale University, Charles S. Dela Cruz, says that due to the impact of the COVID-19 virus, the epidemic could reveal a high number of previously unknown secondary effects.
"I fear that we will see a flood wave of problems when this is over," says Andrew Bolton, the president of the international association of diabetes patients.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus outbreak could indirectly lead to an increase in complications related to diabetes, such as kidney disease and kidney failure.
One recent study suggests that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in cases of diabetes.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the connection between the coronavirus and type 2 diabetes.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs, and kidneys, organs that are already weakened in many people with diabetes.
High levels of glucose and lipids in diabetic individuals can trigger a so-called "cytokine storm", when the immune system overreacts and attacks the body.
Entertainment intake cells can also lead to inflammation that can cause fatal blood clots.
"This is all one big puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
"This is all interconnected."
The news has been corrected.
"We were offered a fight wine, so they left the room."
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason were presented with the unusual request from the artist Ragnari Kjartansson to engage in sexual activities in front of a camera for a piece of artwork the artist was setting up in Paris.
"We loved each other so it wasn't complicated."
Atli Bollason never forgets the first time he met his wife and mother of his child, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir.
"I was very charmed by her."
"It was obviously just the radiation, but to me it also seemed incredibly sweet."
"And yet," he says.
Ásrún remembers this too since her husband first regularly brought it up.
"I always hear this story."
"Just last weekend," she says, who also accepted her husband's invitation at their first meeting.
"I found and still find so much buzz around Atla, who I'm fond of."
"There is a lot going on and much happening and I am enchanted by it."
Atli says that the couple has emphasized in their relationship to go their own ways.
"We don't tie our bags with the same knots as fellow travelers."
"We resist routines that we recognize around us."
There is possibly a reason why they accepted the message from Ragnar Kjartansson, an artist, only with enthusiasm, even though it was, to say the least, unusual.
"Kristín Anna, our mutual friend, has contacted us and asked if we can join her for dessert with Ragnar's wife, Ragga, and Ingibjörg at Snaps."
They accepted the invitation, met the threesome at Snaps and got themselves dessert wine and their respective desserts.
They listened to Ragnar who led them through his plans for an art exhibition that he planned to set up in Palais de Tokyo in Paris during autumn.
"He had a multi-screen video installation called Scenes from western culture."
"He explained it in a simple way."
Ásrún says that he has described the work as banal and decadent scenes from the everyday life of West Icelanders.
"He had sketches of all the scenes he intended to shoot and finally he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating in."
The task that Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was to show a young middle-class couple how to love in a minimalist room.
"These are procedures with a beginning and an end," says Atli.
The couple didn't know Ragnar well even though they had heard of him and he had heard of them "but they knew us and thought we fit into this."
They had decided that they didn't want to advertise for people.
Maybe they thought they wouldn't get the right people, but people who seek sexual satisfaction from performing for others.
They greeted Ragnar and agreed to consider the matter but it did not take long.
"When we stumbled out of Snaps, we said: Aren't we just here for this?"
"That was just how it was."
"I trust Ragnar as an artist and his entire team," says Ásrún and Atli agrees.
"This is about love and intimacy."
The series was shot in a nice apartment on Mýrargata street.
There was a very small film crew; a cameraman, Ragnar, a sound technician, and the couple.
After the recording had been turned off, everyone left the room except for Atli and Ásrún.
"We had not decided anything about how we should be."
"We received some small instructions but we tried to forget the time and place."
To be unaware of what we are doing and for whom.
"There was no playing, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Ásrún.
But was that romantic?
"Yes, it was a bit romantic," says Atli and Ásrún agrees with him.
"We were offered a cup of coffee before they left the room."
"This was a bit like being on holiday at a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was satisfied with the performance of the part in the work that moved with them.
"When Tommi the handyman saw this, he cried because he thought it was so beautiful," says Atli.
"This revolves just as much about love and intimacy as it does about the actual interactions," says Ásrún.
The parents of the couple have seen the work and Atli's mother tells him that she heard the voice of her son at the Reykjavik Art Museum and realized that he was part of the work.
"Then she turns and starts to ponder on this," says Atli.
"Mom and dad saw this in Paris."
"We hadn't told anyone about it like this, but then my dad sends me a message saying 'Nice to run into the little family at Palais de Tokyo,' " recalls Ásrún.
And do you think that the participation in the work deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atli?
"We are still together so maybe this deepened something."
"This certainly strengthened my connection with the extended family," says Ásrún and laughs.
Asrun herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.
"I found it a bit difficult not to be with you but with someone else," she says and turns to her husband.
"But it was fun to see this because this is just one scene in a much larger work, and when you see this with the other works, it's very cool."
I was able to distance myself a little from this and was just proud.
"And there was a little bean in my stomach," says Ásrún, who was not feeling well from another child of the couple when the ultrasound was taken.
"This was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to Ásrún and Atli about love stories on Rás 1.
Swansea with victory in the first semifinal match.
Swansea won a 1-0 victory over Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game between the teams in the playoffs to get into the English Premier League.
The match took place at the home field of Swansea in Wales.
The score was 0-0 at halftime.
The home team in Swansea were awarded a penalty in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew missed the penalty and allowed the ball to be defended.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, a player for Brentford, received a red card.
Brentford played with one less man for the rest of the game and in the 82nd minute, Swansea's players took advantage of the difference in numbers.
Andre Ayew added to the excitement by scoring a great goal and secured Swansea a 1-0 victory.
Swansea leads 1-0 in the match, but the second game takes place next Wednesday at Brentford's home field.
Ambassador-free for five years from the year 2009.
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the American ambassador in Iceland, is in the media spotlight after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard as he feared for his life.
However, it has not been without difficulties for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador here in the country.
Since Carol Van Voorst stepped down from her position as the United States Ambassador in Iceland in April 2009, there has been no ambassador in the country for 62 months, or more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned from office in special circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she should have received the Order of the Falcon.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the president of Iceland, she received a phone call from the presidential office stating that she would not be awarded the word.
After she left Iceland, she taught international relations at the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor arrived to take up the job, in September 2010.
It can be partly attributed to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as an ambassador, but then stopped.
Finally, in the job, Louis Ariega had been working in foreign services for about a decade.
He resigned from his job in the fall of 2013 and took on the position of ambassador to Guatemala.
Then came another period without an ambassador.
Robert Barber received approval from the US Congress in January 2015 and began working shortly after, but at that time no ambassador had been present for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed, rather than diplomatic, as he had worked as a lawyer and briefly for Barack Obama's campaign fund.
He resigned from his position when Donald Trump took office as president on January 20, 2017, as is customary with politically appointed ambassadors.
The Trump administration was unusually appointing both ambassadors and high-level officials in the Washington bureaucracy.
Two years passed until the United States Congress invited Jeffrey Ross Gunter to a meeting to ask him questions and confirm the end of his term as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony in parliament, he said that he had never been to Iceland but had often been to Western Europe, but his deceased wife, who was of Dutch descent, had been born from a mountain.
Gunter is politically active, was previously a dermatologist in California and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The gambling billionaire Sheldon Adelson established those associations, but Adelson is a strong supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter started working in Iceland in May 2019, but no ambassador had been on the island since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example domestically.
The reason is both how long the Trump administration took to appoint people to key positions and that the work of the US Congress has been dragged on for years, including confirming ambassadors.
Since 2009, there has been no ambassador stationed in Iceland for approximately five years.
However, it has not prevented the execution of the embassy's operations, which recently opened new headquarters in Engjateig.
The construction is considered to have cost around 6.5 billion and thick security walls surround the building and bulletproof glass is in all windows.
However, it seems that there is not enough to fill the current ambassador's security needs as he is said to fear for his life and has requested an armed bodyguard.
Former IBV player faced racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland."
Tonny Mawejje, a former player for ÍBV, claims to have experienced racism when he was in Iceland and that he still remembers it after coming to the country.
This comes up in an interview with Tonny published in the Ugandan media outlet, Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the team Uganda Police FC, and plays in the top league of Uganda.
In the interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time here in Iceland where he played with ÍBV, Val, and Þróttur.
"When I arrived in Iceland, I didn't play in midfield like I was used to playing."
"The captain of the team was in that position and in addition, he also had the jersey number that I wanted, so I got exactly what I wanted," said Tonny as he played on the right wing during the game with ÍBV.
Among the things that Tonny talks about is the racism he faced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
"This happened to me once but since I didn't understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me."
Later, I heard about the matter and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
"He told me that my opponent had made racist comments about me after I tackled him."
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He says that he made the mistakes that he regrets the most.
Tonny had not managed to make it into the starting lineup at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more in order to make it to the national team.
Then he asked to return to Iceland on a loan, but he joined forces with Val.
"It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan."
"I think if I had been in Norway longer, then I would have gotten the opportunity that I wanted," says Tonny, but he hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would probably go further.
He wants to imply that the loan to Iceland settled his dream of joining a major team in Europe.
Found a snake in a woman's throat.
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 cm long black worm in the throat of a woman who sought medical attention there.
The doctor managed to extract the worm with a pair of tongs.
Research revealed that it was a type of insect.
CNN reports on this.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days before, which are thin slices of meat.
The queen recovered quickly after the snake was removed, but parasites such as this are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi made its way to the West, cases where parasites have been transmitted to people have increased, according to CNN.
Afraid that a second wave is starting in Europe.
Spain is currently in crisis in relation to concerns about a second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, and authorities have taken measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic again.
In Catalonia, all entertainment life has been put on ice for two weeks, as there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also taken measures due to the increase of infections in Spain, but in Britain everyone must go into quarantine upon their return from Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned against travelling to Spain.
The number of infections is also increasing again in France and Germany, where authorities are trying to find a balance between limiting the spread of the virus and restarting the economy.
The situation in Europe is good compared to other places in the world, but the prevalence of infections worldwide is approaching 300,000 per day, with the majority of infections occurring in America and South Asia.
Confirmed infections have reached 16 million worldwide, according to the count of Johns Hopkins University, and confirmed deaths related to the virus have reached 644 thousand.
Gerða's mosaic work finally gets to be enjoyed to the fullest.
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavik, there is a large and deep hole.
Above her, there are people with orange helmets.
There is also a big hole.
And more small machines for work.
The street is closed to traffic.
"But the gangway is spacious and now many wander around and admire artwork made from millions of mosaic tiles - as if they have never seen it before."
Maybe they have never seen it before.
At least do not consider it valuable for yourself.
The work has been somewhat hidden, in front of it there were always crowded parking spaces.
People parked there, locked their car in a hurry and then set off to attend to their business in the city center.
"Vibrant and diverse public space" and "enticing urban fabric" are guiding lights in the reconstruction of Tryggvagata, which now stands over it.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow Gerður Helgadóttir's mosaic work at the Tollhouse to be better enjoyed.
In front of the work, there will be a plaza and since the area is well situated in regards to the sun, it is considered to be suitable as a resting area for travelers.
The art piece will be illuminated and now the material can enjoy itself better than before on this 142 square meter floor.
In the area, there will also be small "mist towers", some kind of water sculptures, which offer playfulness and provide a certain secrecy to the area.
This describes the improvements made by the city of Reykjavik, which were carried out along with Veitur.
Water, heating, and electricity supply systems will be renewed.
Many of them have reached their years, but the piping and cold water piping are from 1925 and have therefore served residents and businesses in the city center for almost a century.
When the street is reopened after construction is finished, cars can drive on it again.
But it becomes a one-way street and at the same time creates a calmer and more accessible space for pedestrians.
In an article about the Customs House on the website of the Customs Director, it is said that the building was put into use in 1971 and its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because of the harbour pollution that penetrated through the house, a 250 square meter windowless wall surface was formed out to the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such a plain surface would have a negative impact on the overall street view, if special measures were not taken to embellish the appearance of the house.
The parties agreed to calculate with the assumption of having a permanent art installation put there.
"At that time, a lot was said about Gerður Helgadóttir, an artist, as stated in the summary."
She had worked extensively on mosaic art pieces in Germany and beyond.
It was advisable to first contact her before deciding whether there would be competition for the work.
Often it has been discussed that the work needed to reflect life at the harbor, since the harbor has been the lifeblood of Reykjavik since its creation.
When she was interviewed about the artwork, she became fascinated by such production.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she left the country again, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerður got the time that she decided she needed for herself, and when she returned home, she presented some suggestions for discussion.
Approval was granted without hesitation to ask her to complete the task.
Furthermore, there was a desire to make a comprehensive agreement with her and the famous art company in Germany, the Oidtmann Brothers, as Gerður had long worked with them on the installation of famous artworks throughout Europe.
Agreements were made and Gerður worked on the artwork during its installation at the workshop of those brothers, who later took care of the installation at Tollhúsið.
"The entire project had been extremely well executed, both by Gerður Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann brothers, states the summary."
It has survived the harsh Icelandic weather for a long time.
It took Gerður two years to complete the work, which was done and erected in the years 1972 and 1973.
The female artist died two years after the completion of the Custom House, only 47 years old.
Preparing the relocation of several institutions abroad.
Minister of Social Affairs Ásmundur Einar Daðason announces that more public institutions will be relocated off the mainland in the near future.
The minister said this in the segment Sprengisandi on Bylgjan radio station in the midday.
Recently, it was announced that the Housing and Construction Agency's department of fire safety would be relocated to Sauðárkrókur in the north this fall.
Six specialists in firefighting work at the institution, but none of them are planning to follow the institution north, and the National Association of Firefighters and Ambulance Drivers has criticized the transfer of livestock.
"I think we should take further steps in this matter."
I am preparing for further steps in this matter.
"Further transportation," said Ásmundur.
He claims to be convinced that a large majority of the nation wants to see greater distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
"I think further political decisions need to be made about moving public jobs out of the country, just as I was doing with the Housing and Construction Authority," said Ásmundur, who also gave examples of other institutions that have been relocated out of the country and have been of great importance to communities abroad, such as the relocation of the Food Institute to Selfoss, the Icelandic Mapping Agency to Akranes, and unemployment insurance in Skagaströnd."
All the main things from the final day of the Master's Tournament.
94th Icelandic Championships in amateur sports ended at Þórsvellir in Akureyri today.
Some records were set on the final day of the competition.
Exciting competition was calculated in women's hammer throw at Þórsvellir, where Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set the Icelandic record in hammer throw in 2014, which stood until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR improved the record in May last year.
Vigdís reclaimed the Icelandic record earlier this summer and has been in excellent form recently, having improved upon the record set during the summer.
Elísabet Rut has been struggling with an injury and couldn't make it to practice today.
She only had one valid throw out of five, threw 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the furthest of all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt and also set a record.
Her Icelandic record that she set earlier in July is 62.69 meters and it was still somewhat distant from it.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from ÍR had the second-best throw of the day, but she improved her result with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's category, FH athlete Hilmar Örn Jónsson, Iceland's champion in hammer throwing, secured a confident victory by throwing 73.84 meters in his penultimate throw and setting a new record.
His Icelandic record in the event is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, an Olympic participant and Iceland's champion in shot put, won a competition in shot put at Þórsvellir yesterday, but today he competed in his main event, shot put.
Guðni Valur's Icelandic record is 65.53 meters, but he threw the longest distance of 59.13 meters today and secured the win.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson made the second-longest throw today, but he had one valid throw that landed him in second place with a distance of 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, Iceland's long jump champion, won the long jump competition with ease but today Hafdís jumped the furthest with a distance of 6.25 meters, which is just about 40 cm short of her Icelandic record.
In the 200-meter women's race, it was the ÍR athlete Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was the most agile, crossing the finish line in 24.04 seconds, while her Icelandic record in the event is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was victorious in Akureyri and she won two gold medals yesterday, in the 100 meter sprint and the 4 x 100 meter relay, and also in the 4 x 400 meter relay today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was the first to finish the 200-meter race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Máni Samúelsson from Ármann.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in both the 100 meter and 400 meter races yesterday.
Not convicted for a 27 million ISK Bitcoin operation.
The Overdue Tax Committee has rejected the demand of the tax investigation director who sought a fine for a man for not reporting his financial gains obtained from the sale of Bitcoin.
The committee concludes that the tax investigation director did not provide clear reasoning for why it was necessary to fine the individual.
The decision of the committee reveals that the tax investigation director believed that the man had made materially false tax returns for the income years 2016 and 2017.
He had mismanaged his financial income that had come from selling the digital currency Bitcoin, totaling up to 27 million, either intentionally or due to significant negligence.
The fine would punish the man for his misconduct.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
He managed to have sold a cryptocurrency for 27 million in the year 2016.
He could have acquired it with a graveller during the years 2009 and 2010 when it would have been easy and cheap with a regular household computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the cryptocurrency, the tax execution due to such sale had been significantly unclear and unpredictable.
It would have been difficult to expect ordinary citizens to be aware of such measures on tax returns.
He had not intended to avoid paying taxes on the harvest and had accounted for his assets in his balance as a deposit in a currency account.
He had asked both experts and the director of the state tax about how this should be managed but without success.
Then he considered that it was necessary to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started to mine Bitcoin.
He would have been in a worse position than others to familiarize himself with complex rules that tax authorities had not formed a clear opinion on.
The man believed it was right that his taxes for these two income years would be reassessed and taxed, but no other punishment would be imposed.
He repeated that he works in Iceland and has paid taxes in this country since 2012.
He had never intended to evade his responsibilities in an improper manner.
The demand for punishment would be fitting and it would burden him with debt.
Brynjólfur raises a point: "This man understands what football is".
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been quite a topic of conversation among people and has also gained admiration for his success during his playing time with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max League.
The lights will be on in the stadium tonight when they receive IA in live broadcasting on Stöð 2 Sport.
Brynjolfur receives a suspension from play due to four warnings about the game time and therefore does not show up to play with a new haircut like in previous summer games.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his forehead for the game against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
"I don't know exactly who he was responding to with the payment, but speaking of character, it was better to try in the game."
He did not attend the meeting.
"He wants to get the ball every single time, and if someone was going to even out this game then I thought he would do it or make it happen," said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max studio, when the conversation turned to Brynjólfur.
"I should be here for the people."
"It is difficult sometimes to understand in what position he is."
"He searches a bit to the left when it starts to approach game time, but he has a very free role in the team," said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
"Thorkell Mani Petursson says that Brynjolf is a really entertaining person and is happy to have such a colorful character on the team. "There's no doubt that this is true."
This is a fun girl and I love that about her with her hair, and always being ready to meet and answer in interviews.
There are incredibly many people occupied with him, who tell me that this man understands what football is.
"I am a fun force."
"I'm supposed to be here for the people and have fun with it."
"The people are reading the interviews with Brynjólf, people are logging in and following what the next thing on his agenda is."
"This man is simply brilliant," said Máni.
Player of KR says he wants to leave the club - "I have been in contact with some teams in the B division".
Tobias Thomsen, player for KR in the Pepsi Max division, appears to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish news source Bold, Tobias is ready to go back home to Denmark.
Fótbolti.net also reported about the goal.
Tobias wants to catch the beginning of the season in his home country but he first needs to terminate his contract with KR, where the Danish league starts before the Icelandic one.
"The company knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me great understanding," Tobias said in conversation with Bold.
"I have been in contact with some teams in the B-league and will likely switch before the Icelandic season ends."
"There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay my contract with KR."
Then he says that he probably needs to take a pay cut in Denmark.
"Members in Denmark have probably found more economic impact from the virus than in Iceland."
The bicycle whisperer Bjartmar has recovered bicycles worth millions - answering for himself after a discussion in DV.
For several years, Bjartmar Leósson has had interests different from most others.
He lifts and saves lost and stolen bicycles, electric bicycles and Vespas.
Bjartmar has earned the nickname "the bicycle whisperer" recently.
Yesterday there was quite a commotion when someone reported their interaction with Bjartmar.
DV referred to the discussions on a Facebook group of Vesturbæir residents where it was revealed that Bjartmar had spoken with the man on Austurvöllur and suggested that the Vespa may possibly be stolen.
Was there anything else to be read from the original writings of the electrician other than that Bjartmar had accused him of theft.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original DV news has been updated accordingly.
Bjartmar's initial news about the case is not informative about what actually happened yesterday at Austurvöllur.
Bjartmar claimed to have received information from a victim of electrocution that this was indeed his electric scooter.
The information received by the alleged owner from others turned out to be wrong, says Bjartmar.
"I looked towards the guy and examined the boat, as there was information that an electric boat that had been missing for a very long time was supposed to be there and that a search had been carried out."
I certainly hesitated at first, but when I saw him preparing to leave on the shuttle, I decided to approach and talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his case and therefore I decided to have a conversation with the man.
Generally, I do very well in such matters, but before I could finish what I was saying, the man took the word away from me.
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric scooter had, under the same order, offered to show him the receipt for the bike and had himself called the police.
"Great," said Bjartmar, "let's just clear this up."
So the owner of the electric scooter proved ownership of his electric scooter and drove off.
Later, the owner of the electric scooter recounted his story on Facebook, as previously reported in the news.
During this past year that Bjartmar has dedicated to his pursuit, he claims to have experienced situations where he encountered a hundred different people with entirely opposing views.
"I have had peaceful communication with the toughest men in Reykjavík," said Bjartmar and points out that bicycle thieves are often the smallest brothers and sisters of society, addicts, mentally ill people, and other people who are for some reason on the streets.
"Addiction is a harsh master and somehow the next fix needs to be financed, unfortunately theft is an easy way to accomplish that with loose finances," says Bjartmar.
"My interactions with these people are actually so good that I have a lot of good people with me on my team."
"There are examples of people who have gone through treatment, taken care of themselves, and then come to me and assisted me in what I am doing," he says.
Generally, Bjartmar's communication with cyclists is in courteous terms.
Some people know about him and what he's doing and willingly offer to show him receipts, bike serial numbers and so on.
Bicycle theft is a big problem that has not been talked about much.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are even more telling people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with the previous news coverage by DV and claims that there is no sort of self-regulated police in personal pursuit of justice.
Asked whether he had not now come onto thin ice with his behavior, and whether this was not primarily the responsibility of the police, Bjartmar says confidently that it is.
"Of course, it's the law's job to do this, but the fact of the matter is that the law simply isn't addressing it."
I have actually seen police officers drive away from a big pile of stolen bikes.
"She is quite frankly powerless in these matters."
"When the law is not doing anything about it, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this category, then why not?" asks Bjartmar.
He claims to have achieved such great success in riding on stolen bicycles that sometimes his "accomplices" on the street only recognize Brightmar's wheels that they had previously gotten a hold of.
The exchange that Bjartmar has called for assistance from the police has occurred, but she simply does not show up.
"This is simply not working with the police, and it's not for me to teach them and it's not for the owners of the bicycles to teach them," said Bjartmar and is sorry that the victims of bike theft have to suffer from the incompetence of the police in this category of crime.
The success of Bjartmar is not disputed.
Stories can be found in many places about people who are grateful to Bjartmar for having regained their belongings.
"Sjálfur says that Bjartmar has long been losing track of the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts naturally run in the millions, if not the millions of millions."
Electric cars, bicycles, and electric scooters are popular there, but an electric bike can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works during the day at a preschool and every other weekend he works at a cooperative.
His search for bicycles is an unpaid job that he attends to in his spare time.
Pension funds and long shadows.
The year 2019 was a significant anniversary year for pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had indeed received a pension from the King of Denmark since the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund for officials was established that eventually became a pension fund for all public employees.
The foundation of current pension funds for public sector employees was laid with nationwide wage agreements in the job market in 1969, which mandated an employment-related pension fund with mandatory membership and full collection of funds from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were established on the basis of these agreements and the pension system continued to grow thereafter.
The life insurance system of employees was not the only significant change that the labor movement of the 20th century pushed forward with its wage struggle.
Unemployment insurance had been obtained in a similar manner as in the infamous strike of 1955, and the unions gradually gained success in their demands for sickness benefits and a medical fund, significant vacation rights, reductions in working hours, improvements in housing matters, and various other important matters.
All these rights cost a great and fierce fight, but ultimately proved to be a much greater and long-lasting improvement in wages than the increase in the number of aurar in the wage rate, which disappeared just as quickly in the heat of the inflation that characterized the period after the war until 1990 as many will remember.
The process leading up to the establishment of universal pension funds in 1969 was both lengthy and complicated.
Although it eventually became clear to everyone that the funds of the provident funds were in fact the property of the provident fund societies, the labor movement insisted that their boards should be composed of representatives from both employers and provident fund societies in equal numbers.
In the years following the establishment of the funds, the demand for a majority of the workforce in the funds' boards was often discussed among employee associations, but it never came to fruition. Therefore, we are still left with the unusual situation where representatives of the fund associations are not a majority in the fund boards.
Article 36 of Act number 129/1997 on mandatory pensions and the activities of pension funds discusses the investment policy of the funds.
In the first paragraph it states that "the pension fund shall have the interests of the members as its guiding light."
Also, paragraph 5 states: "The pension fund shall establish ethical guidelines for investments."
In the investment policy of the Pension Fund for Retail Workers, the following provisions are included, among others, in continuation of the aforementioned legal provisions:
The Pension Fund is a member of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), along with many of the largest pension funds and institutional investors in the Western hemisphere and Europe.
The regulations discuss how emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as good corporate governance, can contribute to improved investment performance of securities markets.
In this way, the interests of investors and the goals of society are aligned in a broader context.
LV considers it important for companies, especially those listed on the stock market, to establish a public policy aimed at maintaining good corporate governance, social responsibility and environmental issues.
The pension fund Gildi, which has one of the largest funds in the country, has set itself a "responsible investment policy" and there are provisions of a similar nature.
"This is all stirred up here as an introduction to the latest buzzword in Icelandic, 'shadow management'."
Where a word is new in the language, it is not expected to have been defined precisely, but the following definition seems to be the most accepted: Shadow governance is when the leader of a union announces in the media that they plan to send representatives of the union to the board of a pension fund with recommendations or instructions on how to approach a specific issue.
If they do not follow the instructions, they will be forced to step down from the management at the first convenience.
If the leader does not take this to the media and does not speak about resignation, then it is not "shadow management", on the other hand, such communication between people is of course always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I suggest to the reader to ponder which path they find "darker".
There are primarily two men who have tried to shape this definition as it is being written, on the morning of Saturday, July 25th, 2020.
Those are Hörður Ægisson, a journalist at Fréttablaðið, and Ásgeir Jónsson, a central bank director.
The occasion arose after Bogi Nils Bogason, the CEO of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and flight crew, and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, the chairman of the Reykjavik Trade Union, issued a recommendation to the company's representatives on the board of the Pension Fund of Trade Union Members not to support the possible purchase of the company's stocks, or they might be asked to step down.
A little later, Bogi Nils reversed his decision and subsequently, Ragnar Þór followed the same path with his recommendations aimed at Bogi's decision.
However, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to elaborate on the issue in Friday's issue of Fréttablaðið newspaper, using strong words regarding corruption, law-breaking, and the urgent need for changes in the law.
There was a small mound there that really had to bear a heavy load, although the blessed mound had been in contact and also quickly dried out.
Where language is important, we should focus on the content itself in the end.
I have previously touched upon the provisions in the laws regarding pension funds that relate to this matter.
In it lies the responsibility of fund managers to protect the interests of fund participants and to have ethical standards in investments, and these aspects are further elaborated in approved guidelines of both the Gildi and Lífeyrissjóður of trade unions as I mentioned.
Pension funds should NOT only focus on short-term profit-generating investments.
Such a direction would be extremely dangerous and it is not necessary to look far for examples of this in the past, where large loans from banks and funds have flowed to immoral adventurers and environmental funds, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on thin ice when it occurred to him to lay off a whole group of employees, thereby seriously undermining the goodwill the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position with investors.
As he looked closer, he noticed and withdrew this.
The time will reveal whether the investment of pension funds in the company can be considered responsible towards the fund participants when the situation arises.

One of the infected did not undergo home quarantine.
One of the three who were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived in the country from the Eastern Balkans on July 15th last, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who is not permanently resident here and therefore did not receive clear instructions on maintaining the so-called homecoming quarantine upon arrival and going for another screening a few days after arrival.
He received a negative response when crossing the borders.
"But he is part of Icelandic society and should in fact seek to use it," says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, a specialist in infectious diseases at the Directorate of Health and deputy chief epidemiologist while he is on summer vacation, in an interview with Fréttablaðið today.
"He used the English registration form where there is no obligation to register the social security number, and if the social security number is not registered, you will not be automatically invited to the later screening."
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually residing abroad, but due to his connections in the country as an Icelander, he should have rather used the Icelandic one.
However, he had not understood this.
"When the social security number is not registered, you need to seek it out yourself to participate in the later examination."
"Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that it was the right way," says Kamilla.
"So it is clear that we need to strengthen the information provision about this while we find a way to automate the notification system even if Icelanders do not register their social security number."
"Or to somehow make it more clear who the participants in Icelandic society are in the registration system," she explains.
As it turns out, the person in question might still get into the country, even if he is identified as a participant in the Icelandic society, being an Icelander.
Only six have been quarantined after he was diagnosed yesterday and all six were in close proximity to him.
They still have to undergo testing, but two of them are showing symptoms of a Covid-19 infection.
The man had a negative result from his COVID-19 test at the border on July 15th.
Kamilla says it's likely that he had recently been infected with the virus, as it had not yet been detected in him when the sample was taken at the border.
She does not want to rule out that the man may have contracted the virus here in Iceland and not brought it with him to the country.
"It is not entirely possible to claim that this is definitely imported infection because it has been so long since he arrived in the country that he could have been exposed here like these two who caused a small outbreak in connection with the sports events."
She says, however, that it is very unlikely due to how few people are infected here.
"It is actually very unlikely," says Kamilla, but emphasizes that it is not possible to rule it out until Icelandic genetic testing has analyzed the virus in the human.
"If we get a virus type that has not been seen here before, it is almost certain that it has been brought to the country."
Pepper spray and explosives used against protesters.
There was a clash between the police and protesters in Seattle last night.
The police used pepper spray and non-lethal explosives against the protesters, while the protesters broke windows and set fires.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police brutality and LGBTQ+ prejudice were protested against throughout the United States last night, with the protests in Seattle in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot dead.
According to what appears on the BBC, the terrorist has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a construction site and broke windows at the city courthouse.
In the aftermath, the police said that the protests were violent and there were clashes between groups of protesters and police.
Demanding justice in Aurora, Colorado, was Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was killed by police in August of last year, least remembered by protesters.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of members of black militias came together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was killed by the police in her home last March.
The group carried firearms and walked in formation towards closed intersections where the police separated the group from a crowd of people protesting against the protests and also carrying firearms.
Then, 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was killed by a white bar owner in May.
Solskjær: It's not the game that defines our season.
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, manager of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of the game against Leicester today in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea doesn't lose against Wolves, then Solskjær and his men will finish in 5th place and thus miss out on a Champions League spot.
Then they still have hope of making it to Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
"We have not reached the final destination."
"If we manage to score against Leicester I think people will say that we have not had a bad period," said Solskjær.
"Whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot to catch up with the two teams above us," said Solskjær.
It is clear that the nerves of people will be there at 3 pm today, but Solskjær tried to make it seem like it was just another game.
"If one wants to belong to Manchester United, one must get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season."
This is nothing new, and the company is built on this.
"We have prepared ourselves for a great opportunity to end the season well and now it is up to us to seize it," said Solskjær.
"This is not the most important game of the season, it's just the next game."
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important one.
"The results do not define our time period, we have already spent many hours defining this time period."
"Having Bruno Fernandes has changed a lot for us and I believe that overall we are in better shape and mentally stronger than in the last season," said Solskjær.
65,000 infections in a year.
65,490 new cases of the coronavirus were diagnosed in the United States yesterday according to the John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 cases have been confirmed in the western hemisphere since the beginning of the pandemic in that country.
900 died from the virus yesterday, but in the last four days alone there have been more than 1,000 deaths due to the virus around the clock.
In total, 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to a forecast by the United States' disease control authority, CNN reports that the number of deaths due to the virus will reach 175,000 by August 15th.
Afraid of another wave of the pandemic.
The Spanish government is now trying, with weakened power, to stop the increasing spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
No more have been reported in one rotation of the sun since the beginning of May and the news comes at the same time as Spaniards begin easing the strictest lockdown measures in Europe.
The setback led to British authorities now requiring passengers coming from Spain to quarantine upon their return.
A week ago, Spain was on the list of safe countries for Brits.
The situation is at its worst in Catalonia in the northeast corner of Spain where the authorities have resorted to extensive measures in an attempt to curb the growth.
In the capital city of Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and bars will have to close at midnight.
Then there is a curfew in effect for 200,000 residents of Segria county in the western region of Catalonia.
It is believed that the decision of the British will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which heavily relies on the arrival of foreign tourists and has been badly hit by the pandemic.
Tui, the largest travel agency in Britain, cancelled all flights that were scheduled for today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the pandemic, but there seems to be little interest in implementing extensive lockdowns which have devastated economies in many places.
For example, Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of Britain, has taken a very negative view of it and likened it to a nuclear weapon that he does not want to use.
Jean Castex, the Prime Minister of France, has said that the nation "would not survive, economically or socially," if a nationwide curfew were imposed again.
Many officials hope that local measures that reach the residents of individual towns, cities, or regions will be sufficient to prevent the spread of the virus in future outbreaks.
Five new cases of infection in Iceland - three domestic.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday in addition to two more at the borders.
Yesterday, five individuals were diagnosed with a positive Covid-19 infection in Iceland.
In a public announcement, civil protection states that one infection is connected to the infection that was detected yesterday at the ReyCUP soccer tournament.
That person has been sent into isolation, along with sixteen who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
The infected person was a participant in the social activities of a sports club in Reykjavik and, according to the announcement, is only "part of the sports team" in quarantine.
Others who were sent into quarantine connect with the person in a different way.
The origin of this infection is unknown and contact tracing is in full swing by the contact tracing team of the national police commissioner.
The opponents of the ReyCUP tournament have followed the guidelines and regulations of the Chief Medical Officer and Civil Protection that are still in effect, and appropriate measures have been taken.
Although images from yesterday's match caught attention where it could be seen in very close proximity celebrating the good performance of their team out on the field.
Just before 11 am today, the opponents published the following announcement on their Facebook page.
There it says "ATTENTION: Parents please respect the rule that competitors bring their own snack to school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do that.
Thank you for the demonstrated understanding.
Another infection was detected yesterday, but it is related to the infection detected the day before yesterday.
The announcement says: "Icelandic genetic analysis has separated the infections and a new type of virus has been revealed that has not been detected here before."
Work is being done on infection control in that matter as well, and the infected person is in isolation and 12 people are in quarantine due to the infection.
The third infection in question is from a person who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, on July 15th.
He was discovered on the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six others who were in close proximity to him are in quarantine.
Two of them have already started showing symptoms of a viral infection.
In addition, two people were diagnosed at the border and the result of further investigations is awaited, as the procedure for infections at the border requires.
Finally, the announcement states: The Department of Civil Protection and the Chief Medical Officer urge people to be vigilant and pay close attention to personal preventive measures against infection.
There is no doubt that the slightest suspicion of Covid-19 symptoms is enough to ask to get tested at the next health clinic.
Patreksfjörður says the campground is fully booked for the August bank holiday weekend - no vacancies for guests.
The camping area in Patreksfjordur is fully booked for the weekend, according to an announcement from Westfjords Municipality.
Guests are advised to look at other accommodation options.
Vesturbyggð mentions Bíldudalur, Tálknafjörður, Melanes on Rauðasandur, Hotel Flókalund, and Hotel Breiðavík as other options in the area.
It's enough to be in Patreksfjörður this weekend, because just like in previous years, Skjaldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentaries, will be held in the town.
She has been kept since 2007 and has therefore become a strong tradition in the town.
Regarding the application for the camping site, one can expect a good turnout this year, unless the weather throws a wrench in the plans, but DV reported earlier today on an uncertain forecast.
However, one can expect the worst weather in the south, and hope for Patreksfirðingar.
The website bb.is reported first and said that all other accommodations in the town were already fully booked.
A large apartment building is decaying in the best location in the city.
Romanian workers live freely at Dunhaga 18-20.
While owners are applying for building permits for renovations, their application has been pending in the system for three years.
In one of the oldest, greenest, and most expensive neighborhoods of Reykjavik city stands an elegant three-story apartment building.
On the ground floor of the house there is about 600 square meters of retail space.
Behind the house, there are two staircases that each lead to four fairly nice apartments.
They are between 93-130 square meters, although most are over 100.
The house has a considerable history to preserve.
It was built in 1959 and has housed, among other things, a video rental store, shoe repair shop, dairy store of Mjólkursamsölun, Jóa gunsmith, fish market, and most recently Háskólaprent (a printing company for the university).
The house has, to put it lightly, taken care of its garden beautifully.
The house now lies in great disrepair, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
Owners of D18 ehf. are according to the company registry among others Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús went ahead of the owners of Borgarnes and was the defender of the property holding company of Borgarnes.
In the group of owners of the property management company Borgun, there is Stálskip ehf.
Stálskip ehf. is an investment company owned by Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún is also the owner of a one-third share in D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once drove their fishing fleet, Stálskip, out to sea.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and therefore it has hardly been maintained since then.
Tell the neighbors that the condition of the house has been deteriorating steadily, although mostly in recent years.
On a Facebook page for residents of the neighborhood, one resident says that the house "hasn't been particularly lively in recent years."
There, it is possible to record that owners have been striving to change the house and the lot for several years.
Other neighbors say the house has not been okay for a long time.
"It is long overdue to do something decent about this stain, and it is annoying that it has been dragged on like this."
He also says that he is equally angry with the owners of the house for not putting in enough effort to complete this, find some common ground with the neighbors of the house, and stop this "legal stalemate".
"Only do this in consultation with the community around so that it is possible to drive it and complete it."
The "legal snag" referred to by the resident is the zoning process of the area that has been ongoing since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 applied for permission to build an additional floor on top of the existing apartment building and a new elevator shaft and extension on one floor, in addition to a basement.
The building permit granted for that operation was appealed to the Environment and Resource Committee, and the committee declared it invalid because the operation was not supported by the zoning plan and the proximity notification was not sufficient.
Reykjavik city then proceeded with urban planning work and completed it with an advertisement in the Official Journal in July of last year.
That structure was also dear and the committee repealed it in March 2020.
At that point in time, almost three years had passed since the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the house were at the beginning of the process.
The house had been significantly damaged at this time and the neighbors were beginning to tire.
When DV (a news outlet) asked the neighboring house about the situation and the neighbors' responses were varied.
Some understood the plans of the house owners, others not at all.
Some directed their anger towards the city, others did not.
Others were just angry but not necessarily at anyone.
Others said that the parking spaces were a source of conflict, but neighbors have utilized unused parking spaces at Dunhaga 18-20 for their vehicles.
One plaintiff in the case stated that he was weary of the bureaucracy.
"That we have to go through the three-step process is completely unbelievable."
"It's like Reykjavik city can't read."
Today the house stands empty, abandoned and neglected.
Memorial to the floating administration of the city and the lavish plans of the owner and the many years of their work, which is now in its infancy.
When the journalist arrived at Dunhaga 18, the doors slammed shut and there was litter scattered around.
A Playstation computer and a new television lay among other garbage on the ground - victims of Icelandic summer cleaning.
The old office of the University Press was open and there were quite a few cats judging by the smell of urine.
It is clear that someone has made themselves a refuge in one corner but no one visible.
Piles of sofas and beds and a few sheets of geological maps, which probably were meant to become a book, blew around us.
The stairways in the apartment building were equally open and lively in both of them.
The journalist was lucky enough to come across a resident of one of them.
There were some Romans cooking themselves a potato dish for dinner and they invited a journalist in.
The Romanians work for the staffing company Ztrongforce ehf.
"They have been there for some time and according to sources from DV, the company has only paid for heating and electricity but not for the accommodation."
Due to the condition of the house, it is not justifiable to collect rent.
Judging by the number of mail deliveries at the backdoor of the house, it is clear that a considerable amount of foreign workers have lived there in recent months.
The operation of employee leasing has not been heavily affected by the Covid-19 situation, despite the contraction in tourism leading to a contraction in the construction industry, with these two sectors being the most diligent in utilizing the services of employee leasing.
However, the homemakers on Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty to do, as their work clothes and gloves hung in the common space to dry after a long work day in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well-maintained.
When the journalist greeted the Romanian boys, his sarcasm suddenly became clear: The best property in Reykjavík is a 1,500 square meter building for sale.
The owners want to make improvements to the house and the neighbors want to improve the condition, but they have a disagreement about the definition of "improvement".
Between them sits the urban planning area of the city at the starting point, a sacrificial lamb on the endless path of scrutiny and opportunities in the planning process and the fleeting solution of the Environmental and Resource Matters Arbitration Board.
In the house live so many Romanian workers, perhaps precisely those who will improve the situation when Icelanders stop fighting.
The article originally appeared in weekend newspaper DV on July 17th.
In the fight against obesity following the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Prime Minister of Britain, Boris Johnson, will provide £10 million in a campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on fast food advertising, following his serious illness partly due to his weight.
It is expected that Johnson will introduce the campaign, which has been dubbed Better Health, tomorrow, on Monday, and with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe bicycles for their overweight patients and there will also be an effort to promote the expansion of bicycle lanes.
According to sources in the British media, advertisements for fast food places will be banned on TV before 9pm in the evening.
"COVID-19 has alerted us to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use this time to become healthier, more active, and eat healthier food," said a spokesperson for the government.
Johnson has personally struggled with weight problems, but he was hospitalized when he contracted the coronavirus in the spring, and partly due to his weight, he is considered to have been so seriously affected.
Women are better suited to lead the changes.
She said that the new constitution is the biggest step that the nation can take towards greater distribution of power, transparency and in working against corruption and for the benefit of the general public.
"We need to start changing gears a little now, and who is better suited to lead such changes than the group in society that is more comfortable with these values."
"There are women," said Helga.
"Women in Iceland are famous for their status."
To stand together and be together in leading changes.
"So now it's just up to us to lead these changes."
She said she was a little apprehensive about the emphasis on Iceland being the "best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
"Then we are not equally ready to examine what needs to be done."
As Germans are very aware of their history and scrutinize everything that needs to be done.
"That's a lot."
We need to know where we come from and recognize the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of marginalized groups.
"We don't all follow the same rules here," said Helga.
When asked, she said that women are, to a large extent, in good standing in Iceland, but added that like everywhere else, Icelanders uphold highly male-oriented values.
She said that politics revolved around creating personal interests, control, and power, which were the forces that maintained inequality in all societies.
"Women have now formed this group and come together and have become a little bit upset that the parliament intends to overlook this national referendum from 2012," she said.
"These feminine values are what we are considering."
"Based on human rights and environmental protection, cooperation and that we all sit together at the same table," she said and added that the aforementioned values were the fundamental principles of the new constitution.
"We are a very rich country in natural resources, and it is unbelievable that there are people living in poverty here."
"That's ridiculous, we can do it differently," said Helga.
"It is absurd that there is a natural law that women's jobs are always paid less."
"It is ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses have to constantly fight for fair wages."
It is possible to sign the petition for a new constitution here electronically through digital Iceland.
Tried to rob a pedestrian in downtown.
A man was arrested in the city center last night after he threatened a pedestrian and attempted to take money from him.
The police also stopped drug production in Árbær where two people were arrested in connection with the case.
Then the police stopped a motorcycle driver in Hlíðunum, where the driver was driving at a speed of 146 km/h, where the speed limit is 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of his driving rights.
The police in the capital area had their hands full last night and around 80 cases were logged in the police diary from 5 yesterday to 5 in the morning.
There was particularly a lot of publicity for meetings.
On Friday night, there were reports of eleven high-intensity gatherings and it was considered a significant entry in the police diary.
However, 22 serious cases were brought to the attention of the police tonight.
Six were detained in prison cells last night.
In Árbær, the police were called last night when individuals shot fireworks into the air.
However, they were already prepared to defend themselves when the police officer arrived at the yard.
Then there were nine drivers stopped for drunk driving and/or drug driving.
Four were arrested for fighting in the downtown area last night, but one of them was placed in custody.
Then two were taken to the emergency room after falling on their faces, one in the city center and the other in the West End.
One was transported to the emergency department after being injured while jumping on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who was pulling a trailer in Kjalarnes yesterday.
According to the police journal, the bicycle equipment of the bike frame was in "very bad condition" and was immobilized.
It is possible to stay at Monet's house during the Commerce weekend.
The house, in which the impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life, is now available for rent on the Airbnb website.
The next free nights in the house are during the weekend of Commerce Day.
The house is small and pretty, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy in France.
The world-renowned painter lived in the house from 1883 until he passed away in 1926.
There are three bedrooms, two living rooms, and three bathrooms in the house.
Monet first got inspiration to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If someone intends to rent the house, they must rent it for at least two nights.
According to the Airbnb website, it's almost available next week, on Sunday of the shopkeeper's holiday, so it could be ideal for some businessmen on their day off to go ahead and book the painter's house.
The two nights over the holiday weekend cost only 964 US dollars or just over 130,000 Icelandic krona, according to when Fréttablaðið gets closer.
Dozens are in quarantine and some of them have started showing symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Five have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
Dozens have been quarantined due to this and some of them have started to exhibit symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically yesterday and two with border-screening.
A specialist at the office of the chief medical officer says that the increasing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading more widely in society.
"The previous domestic infection has been analyzed and there is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no special reason to believe that it has been lurking in the community for some time."
"This is probably something new to the country, but of course we need to be very vigilant now," said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, a specialist in infectious diseases at the Chief Medical Officer's Office.
Most of them who have been infected have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
Further tests will be conducted soon, but some who were in proximity to those infected are starting to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
"Now there is no flu going on and fewer other respiratory infections, so we can be quite liberal in conducting these tests on individuals who, during flu season, would have found reason to do something else first," said Kamilla.
Contact tracing is mostly completed but it is not excluded that more people will need to go into quarantine.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending a sports event.
It has raised questions as to whether it is justifiable to hold such events.
The communication director of civil protection says that it is manageable as long as people follow guidelines and rules.
Kamilla says that it is almost certain that the infected ones have contracted the virus at the sports event.
"If no more people are isolated based on these individuals after having interacted with them at these sporting events, then we can maintain that our infection prevention measures at the events have been effective."
"But it hasn't come to light," said Kamilla.
The performance of the civil protection division is under constant review.
"We need to be ready to intervene with further recommendations or restrictions if it seems necessary," said Kamilla.
After about a week, it is expected that the restrictions on gatherings will be eased up to a thousand people.
This new location could have an impact on the arrangements.
"A certain contemplation on cooking" - See the menu of Elísu Viðars.
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is a soccer champion and plays with Val.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, a mother, and works as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for the demands of the day and often takes time to cook good and nutritious food.
"A typical day for me starts by going to work at 8 am," says Elísa.
"After work, I go to the shop to prepare dinner before I pick up my daughter from the preschool at three o'clock."
Elísu thinks it's very nourishing to bring her daughter to preschool early.
"It's good to spend time with her before I go to the later part of my workout."
After exercising, it's good to come home and only have to heat up the food.
In the evenings, when the girl is asleep, we find it good to watch an episode to clear our minds.
Elísa does not follow any specific diet.
She is finishing her master's thesis in nutrition and knows well what foods are suitable for her to eat to have enough energy to attend work, school, family and exercise.
"What suits me is to eat a varied diet that is well balanced with proteins, carbohydrates, and fats."
I believe it is most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not classify food as bad or good, but rather as nutrient-rich or nutrient-poor.
It is actually okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not always.
Elísa has a great interest in cooking.
"I find a certain contemplation in standing in the kitchen cooking, and I am very much invested in it."
"I must say that I have self-confidence in the kitchen and I sincerely believe that I am a good cook."
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, let it rest in almond milk overnight.
Top off this meal with whatever is available each time.
Most often it is banana and granola cereal bars with COFFEE.
I am a big coffee drinker.
Measurement: Incredibly varied, but fruits or vegetables, flatbreads, clean skyr with banana and musli, bread with toppings, and I could eat hummus with a spoon straight from the container if that's an option.
Lunch: I often make myself all kinds of protein-rich salads from what's in the fridge, quinoa or barley, falafel balls, rocky salad, oven-baked vegetables with a good dressing is what I'm working with.
If the organization goes completely haywire (which often happens), then the coffee maker at work has come to my rescue quite often and then it's 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese, and boiled eggs, nothing more.
Measurement: Get me something high in carbohydrates for exercise, bread with toppings, cereal or fruit for breakfast.
Dinner: Fish is often the choice at my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Conflict between police and protesters in Seattle.
City authorities in Seattle, Washington state, have declared a state of emergency in the aftermath of large-scale protests in downtown.
Yesterday, the police seized fireworks and pepper spray in an attempt to clear a large area that protesters had taken over and stretched over many house lengths near the parliament building in the city.
The police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and an investigation was underway into vandalism that was carried out at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of explosive device.
The municipal and police authorities say that protesters have attacked the police with rocks, bottles, improvised explosives and other loose materials, and one police officer was taken to hospital where he was treated for his injuries.
The protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
The police were there to show solidarity to the protesters in Portland, Oregon, but in the city there have repeatedly been violent confrontations between protesters and heavily armed federal law enforcement officers.
There, like in several cities in the United States, people gather under the signs of Black Lives Matter, remembering Georges Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25th, protesting systemic racism in American society, and demanding change.
Not revoked until after a vote.
It is still unclear whether the statements of Icelandair flight attendants, which are supposed to take effect at the next month's turn, will be revoked.
The digital vote count on the collective bargaining agreement of the Icelandic Flight Attendants Association for Icelandair flight attendants ends at noon tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, the chairman of the association, states that she is confident that Icelandair will not make a decision on the layoffs until the results of the vote are available.
"This clearly hangs together," says Guðlaug Líney.
"No statements have been revoked, this will have to remain so that the machines can be manned."
"So naturally, people are without exhaustion after finding out whether they will have a job after the end of the month."
An agreement that was signed a week ago, on the night of July 19th, is being discussed.
It is planned that it will be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement that air hostesses had previously voted on.
On July 17th, the board and executive board of the Icelandair Cabin Crew Association approved a strike of all workers at Icelandair, with members voting in favor in a ballot.
She never arrived, but this was decided after Icelandair's decision to terminate negotiations with the Flight Attendants' Union, lay off all flight attendants and seek agreements with another labor union.
Then the pilots of the company were supposed to take on the job of security teams temporarily.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it's difficult to say.
"People are hurt after this move by Icelandair, when all flight attendants of the company were laid off and it was announced that negotiations would be held with another union."
"Now it will be revealed whether it had an impact," she says.
940 flight attendants were employed at Icelandair at the end of April, but 900 of them, about 95%, were laid off.
Their notice period is variable, those with the shortest employment history have a notice period of three months, which ends at the turn of the month July-August.
In that group are about 90% of the flight attendants of Icelandair.
What happens if the contract is not approved?
"Then we wish for continued negotiations with our counterparts."
With this agreement, we are meeting the demands of Icelandair.
"If he is rejected, it is clear that the flight attendants believe that they have gone too far."
Voting on the wage agreement has ended and Icelandair will announce the first quarter results tomorrow.
The vote count of flight attendants on a new wage agreement ends at noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's financial results for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but the interim results indicate that the company's revenue has decreased by 85 percent from the same period last year.
Digital voting on the collective bargaining agreement between the Icelandic Flight Attendants Association and the Confederation of Icelandic Employers regarding Icelandair began on Wednesday, July 22nd, and ends tomorrow, Monday, July 27th, at noon.
Those who can vote on the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay membership fees to the Flight Attendants Union.
Icelandair and the FFÍ signed a new labor agreement on the night of Sunday, July 19th, but on the Friday before, Icelandair had ended negotiations with the union after flight attendants rejected the previous agreement in a vote in early July.
Then Icelandair had informed all flight attendants and staff members of the company on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new wage agreement was signed.
According to the new collective bargaining agreement, flight attendants need to fly five more hours per month for the same base salary.
The collective bargaining agreement is valid until 2025, but provisions have been harmonized between pilots and flight attendants on how long one can fly on a single shift.
The agreement was presented to members of the FFÍ at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday, and many flight attendants were reported expressing dissatisfaction with the agreement during the interview with the newsroom.
Most people agreed that the agreement should be approved to keep FFÍ alive.
The financial results for Icelandair's second quarter will be announced tomorrow, but according to interim results, the company's EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) for the period was negative, amounting to approximately 100-110 million US dollars or around 15 billion Icelandic krona after accounting for financing and taxes.
Icelandair sent an urgent calculation to the Stock Exchange last Wednesday, stating that the company's revenue had reached approximately 60 million dollars in the last quarter, or approximately 8.3 billion Icelandic króna.
Portable currency and its equivalent were around 154 million US dollars at the end of the quarter, about 21 billion Icelandic kronur.
Icelandair also plans to offer shares of the company in August.
Icelandair aims to finalize agreements with fifteen creditors, government officials, and Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before going public with the stock offering.
A new variant rather than a new species of virus.
"A new virus just means that this has been an individual who came from abroad."
"This is not something that has been buzzing around domestically," says Már Kristjánsson, chief physician at the infectious diseases department of Landspitali, about the news that a "new virus strain" has been detected here in the country.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One participant who has been diagnosed had taken part in the social activities of a sports club at the Rey Cup soccer tournament, but the origin of the infection is unknown and contact tracing is ongoing.
Also, a case was confirmed in an individual who arrived in the country on July 15th, and two people who were in close contact with him have started showing symptoms of COVID-19.
Yesterday, infection was detected that is connected to the infection that was detected the day before and after sequencing at the Icelandic Genetic Analysis, a "new virus species that has not been detected here before" was discovered.
The contact tracing has been completed in relation to that infection.
Már emphasizes that it is not a new virus being discussed, but the same virus that has spread throughout the world, that is the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more accurate to speak of a new variant of the virus rather than a new species of virus.
Asked what it meant and whether it could indicate the onset of a second wave of the pandemic, Már says that it is a specific case and it could be that nothing more comes of it.
"On the other hand, if there are domestic cases that do not have connections to foreign sources and have the same genotype as this particular variant, it would be possible to draw a conclusion [about the later wave], but it is untimely to do so," explains Már.
Happiness in the hot tub.
Is the secret of Icelandic happiness hidden in the hot tubs?
BBC program makers lead in a fun video that sheds light on Iceland's swimming pool and hot tub culture.
Icelandic bath culture is unique worldwide and it is said that there are nowhere else in the world as many bathing facilities per inhabitant.
The natural geothermal energy is the foundation, but also the tradition for swimming that prevails here.
Swimming lessons for children were mandatory in 1940, but older citizens are no less diligent in using the hot water for their health benefits.
Recreational swimming is described as a solid part of the general welfare of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class or status.
When not on their phones, people chat intimately about personal matters concerning their home and life, or are revitalized by the similar power of water: thoughts charge batteries of the mind and body.
To rapidly approach one hundred days until the elections.
There are one hundred days left until Americans go to the polls and elect a president for four years.
Donald Trump is seeking re-election but he still has a steep hill to climb in order to do so.
Joe Biden, the expected candidate of the Democratic Party, has a significant lead over Trump nationwide, according to the opinion polls.
According to a new survey by the AP news agency, a majority of Americans believe that their country is headed in the wrong direction.
Trump's response to the global pandemic of the new coronavirus is also highly unpopular and, in addition, more Americans than before believe that the president has handled economic issues poorly.
Specifically, only two out of every ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent are reported to support Trump's response to the pandemic, and 48 percent say he has done well on economic issues.
In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average of FiveThirtyEight, the support for Biden is 49.9 percent nationwide, while the support for Trump is 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to divert attention from his performance towards Biden, fueling so-called cultural disputes and promoting policy proposals that are supposed to focus on law and order.
"Biden's campaign puts a lot of effort into keeping the attention on Trump and believes there are great chances of winning if the election is ultimately decided on how Trump has performed in his job the last four years."
The unpopularity of Trump also seems to be affecting Republican lawmakers, and Frontline Democrats are feared to even gain a majority in the US Senate, which until now has seemed unlikely.
Politico recently reported that the support of parties and candidates is similar to what it was decades ago, and now the Republican Party would receive its highest victory in decades.
The outlying district has proven particularly bad for the party in the parliamentary elections of 2016 and now it seems likely that this trend will continue.
Trump has tried in recent days to scare residents of suburbs into supporting him, among other things by claiming that if Biden becomes president, he will ruin the suburbs and fuel racial divisions.
Among other things, Trump has repealed a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in neighborhoods.
Then he urged "housewives" in the suburbs of the United States to read an article written by a former assistant governor of New York, where she claimed that Biden would destroy the suburbs and that Trump supported that view.
"Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and the American dream."
"I will preserve it, and even make it even better!" said the president.
Residents of the outskirts of the United States are a growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of this group's votes has become president.
Except for the year 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority of votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Opinion polls have shown that despite Trump securing a substantial majority in the 2016 elections, his support has significantly dwindled there since.
Although there are differences between the polls, Biden has been reported to have a fifteen percentage point lead over Trump in recent surveys.

Will the Olympic flame be the light at the end of the tunnels?
After a final decision had been made to postpone the Olympics, an event that only world wars have interrupted until now, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic flame would be a "light at the end of the tunnel," referring presumably to the global pandemic of the coronavirus currently sweeping the world.
Outstanding individuals have additionally been preparing themselves and authorities in Japan are increasing their expenses due to the delay.
Everyone keeps their head up high, despite the great turmoil.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue of the Olympic Games this year, the Japanese representatives' celebration was unsurpassed.
They cried and laughed in turns, as Tokyo had applied to host the 2016 Olympic games, but the bid was surpassed by Rio in Brazil.
This time Tokyo and Japan should bathe in the attention of the world.
The games were supposed to take place from July 24th to August 9th, but have been delayed for a year and will instead start on July 23rd, 2021 and end on August 8th.
If it is not possible to hold the games, if the coronavirus poses too great a threat, the games will be canceled.
No one really wants to fully think through that thought to the end.
Olympic games are not just an ordinary sports competition.
There is nothing saved, the performance always has to be magnificent and strive to surpass the last game.
The choice of city for the Olympic Games depends on the assessment of the selection committee based on the presentations of the cities.
The more impressive the presentation is - the more likely it is to receive the applause.
Tokyo spent 150 million dollars in trying to host the 2016 Olympic Games, which is roughly equivalent to 20 billion Icelandic krónur.
In the second instance, when the bid was made for the 2020 games, 75 million dollars, around ten billion Icelandic króna, were invested in the presentation.
In the year 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would host the games this year, Japanese authorities had already secured funding amounting to 30 billion Icelandic króna for the project.
But that amount is just a drop in the ocean compared to what it costs to build an Olympic village, stadiums and generally strengthen the infrastructure of the country to manage such events, prepare for it and host the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be held these days but have been postponed for a year due to the coronavirus, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.
In a report from the state inspector in Japan that was released at the end of last year, it was revealed that the cost was nearly twice the amount stated.
It's probably not possible to fully cover the cost of delaying the games with food, but it's estimated that it could cost an additional two to six billion dollars on top of the initial cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between 15 and 30 billion dollars.
The numbers are so high that all Icelandic government tax revenues only matched about half of the lowest possible Olympic Games cost.
The Olympics are events of such magnitude that they often become the subject of economists, who try to delve into numbers and examine the profit and benefit of the games.
In short, it seems that many people have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympic Games is less positive for the economy of the cities that host them.
Short-term effects are some, for example, there is a lot of work available for a short time, but in the long term, cities often end up with a debt trail and high operating costs for underused infrastructure.
Rio in Brazil has significant debts due to the 2016 games and has struggled to afford maintenance on all the large sports facilities that were built for the games.
Figures have been examined following the games in London 2012 and it has been revealed that only 10 percent of those who obtained employment related to the Olympics in the city were unemployed before.
That means that there were no new jobs except to a small extent.
In general, cities have not fared well financially in hosting the Olympics due to the staggering costs associated with constructing buildings for the games.
Benefit is often thought to lie in increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the games, although there is much uncertainty regarding the 2021 games.
It is also uncertain if it will be possible to accommodate all the usual number of spectators who attend the games.
The main issue is still the honor that the cities gain by being selected, but it is difficult to measure in monetary terms.
Therefore, despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy brought by games is of a nature that cannot be measured.
But although the exhibition is often popular and no expense is spared, this is of course not just about money.
"Sports heroes are in the foreground."
For some high achievers, it is just convenient to postpone games.
For example, the Australian pentathlete and gold medalist in her discipline at the last Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, is currently out of shape and has not been performing well this summer, but she hopes to have gotten back into competition shape for the 2021 games.
She is therefore among those athletes who are just rather pleased with the delay, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who had planned to quit after the games this year, had they been held at the right time, the postponement of the games in some cases means they may quit the competition before the games take place.
Simply trusting their bodies is not enough to go through years of rigorous training.
Few athletes gained as much admiration from spectators at the Rio 2016 Olympics as the gymnastics star Simone Biles did, but some did come close in their hearts.
She came home with four golds around her neck and one bronze.
"Biles has attended several interviews in her home country, the United States, recently to discuss the Olympics."
She plans to participate in the games in 2021, but she is not necessarily sure that she will still be at the top of the games next year, as she will then be 24 years old.
Although it is not generally considered to be a high age, it is at most a high age for a female athlete in the top echelon.
"This is a sensitive issue," says Biles, but still smiles during an interview published on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page when asked whether she plans to achieve the same level of success at the 2021 games as she did in Rio 2016.
"I just don't know if I'll still be at the top after a whole year of training," says Biles.
She has previously talked about how her body can no longer handle the stress that comes with rigorous athletic training for a long period of time.
Nevertheless, she is training hard for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to suddenly have to stop exercising when the pandemic was at its peak and the gym was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles more than others while all athletic facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympic gold medals couldn't buy her any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to keep herself in shape just like everyone else.
The basic form is definitely slightly better than for most people.
"We have a tight plan now."
It was difficult to start exercising again after the gym reopened.
We started slowly but have picked up full speed towards something new, and I will increase the exercises steadily as the year progresses.
Of course, we don't know exactly how these games will turn out or if they will even be held, but still, we practice assuming that they will happen, there's nothing else to do.
"I have put too much on myself to leave the sport now," says Biles.
With her, like many others, there is a sense of uncertainty or perhaps even awareness that the situation could arise where the games will not be held at all in 2021.
To predict that is hopeless.
No one can know how the situation with the global COVID-19 pandemic will be in July 2021, and there is nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympics assuming that they will be held that year.
Maybe the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
Postponed the wedding due to the pandemic.
The Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other more important things to think about right now," said the actress in a conversation with People.
"We would really like to get married at some point and have the dream wedding and have all our loved ones present."
But we decided to postpone that and focus on what is important right now, which is to assist in sharing information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I am paying more attention to world affairs than wedding matters these days.
"There is a lot going on and we should direct our attention to what is happening in the world."
