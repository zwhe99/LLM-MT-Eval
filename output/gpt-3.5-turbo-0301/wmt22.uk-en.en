Good afternoon, I apologize, I did not have internet and could not send it faster. Thank you.
Please tell me the exact address where to go for cleaning tomorrow, what is the code for the keys and at what time will the guests leave tomorrow and new ones will arrive?
Unfortunately, I have to refuse your offer because I have already found a job during this time.
Sorry, but I cannot refuse there.
Sometimes I feel that my thoughts in Czech language through a translator differ from what I write in Ukrainian.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Good day, I agree to the course.
However, could you please tell me if there is an earlier time?
Because I don't live in Prague, there may be difficulties with transportation.
If there are no other options, then I agree anyway.
Thank you in advance.
In Kherson, people have taken to the streets in protest again, Russians were unable to disperse them in time.
As reported by the event's participants to the agency, the residents of Kherson managed to hold a protest before Russian military forces with equipment arrived to disperse it.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now the Russian equipment has arrived there," one of the participants of the event said.
Previously, the townspeople traditionally gathered for protest actions at Svoboda Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and the Regional Council.
This square is currently the control of armed Russian forces, who use weapons against protesters and kidnap people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kahovka.
As reported by Ukrinform, residents of Donetsk regularly hold peaceful protest actions against the Russian aggressor.
Russian military forces are using force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
Russian invaders also kidnap residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded the city of Kherson the special title of "Hero City".
On February 24th, Russian President Putin began a full-scale invasion into Ukraine.
Russian forces are shelling and destroying key infrastructure objects, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas in Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, and ballistic missiles.
I often dream of my dad here.
He passed away on the next day after my birthday.
In general, the dreams are good.
Hello, good day.
"I did as you wrote, and the phone started to charge!"
Very good news!
Thank you!
We can meet for an hour or two and then I will go home because I don't have the necessary things with me.
The janitor in a red jumpsuit is dragging a rocket to the trash. No changes on the Kharkiv front.
You can book a TV with a console and remote control, pots, pillows, chairs, frying pans.
Oleg also found me a part-time job - cleaning 2 apartments that are rented out to tourists on a daily basis.
Apartments in the center of Prague are located.
Will it be convenient for you to go to the bank with me on Monday? Or on another day?
Good day, it would be great if you could today as you wrote at 5:00 PM.
That's why I read the Bible, the Quran, and other things to find answers to the questions I was looking for.
Where is the accommodation that needs to be cleaned?
Do you mean having good dreams?
As an attachment to this report, I am sending you a list of job vacancies offered to us by employers.
If you're interested in the offer, please contact the person directly through the advertisement.
I hope that there will be places available here because our relatives - my uncle's wife, her parents, and daughter - also plan to come.
They have tickets for April 20th.
God grant that you arrive safely.
When you arrive, call me on the phone. The doorbell is not working.
It would be better to be cheaper...we are forced to move because we cannot afford European prices financially.
I need to take a look at the place and try to see where it hurts.
"He wants to press on all my painful points right now, he knows which ones."
It just doesn't affect me at all anymore.
Yesterday, I didn't want to talk about him and his drama at Mishka's.
You can't close banks, it's not worth it in the rain. When there's no rain, I'll close them.üôÇ
Therefore, I simply feel uncomfortable in my own body.

Can I return the money for the doctor to you?
Your coffee has already arrived, I can bring it tomorrow :)
You can leave your purchases in your car and we'll pick up the children and collect the things later.
I have already written to you twice :)) but I am making a double circle for trains.
I didn't understand, will Valya and I be alone together in the morning?
Did you mean that we clean up on our own and you simply supervise?
Can we swap shifts with Valya? Valya in the morning, and me after lunch?
Mom will live here in the dormitory because the fee for the dormitory is low.
The main thing is that I have a place to live.
Sasha was absent from school today, so I wrote an email to her teacher.
Helloüëãüèª I got sick, so it would be better to reschedule our meeting for the next weekend, sorry.
I know how to cook, the main thing is to have a recipe, but I like to bake pastries.
In Ukraine, borscht, varenyky and other dishes are traditional.
I don't have favorite dishes, I love trying various dishes from different countries.
What are your food preferences? Do you like to cook?
I want to be busy with something.
More precisely, the train exists but there are no seats available.
Sorry, but we are a little late.
Lucia, can I be your assistant in the kitchen too?
It's great that Yulia will have the opportunity to go to work.
Yesterday evening I went to their apartment.
It's very luxurious and convenient there.
On Tuesday, Pablo will tell me if there will be a job for Nazar at the brewery and when he should come to arrange a meeting.
If Nazar works from 5:30, he can use any train.
Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, if it stops fighting, we will have weak positions.
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the battles for Eastern Ukraine, and in particular for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the Ukrainian Armed Forces suffer defeat there, the Russians may abandon negotiations and once again occupy the de-occupied territories.
Direct speech: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today."
It fights ‚Äì we fight, we are strong.
If it stops beating - we will have weaker positions.
They (city defenders) are people who have drawn a lot of enemy fire onto themselves.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the country, in the area of the Joint Forces Operation, and if they become stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our situation is weak in all these directions, then we may not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will be taking all the steps that can lead to the return even to the cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can leave and that's it.
Then our situation in negotiations will be weaker and perhaps even uninteresting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we ascertain.
"We believe in our result, in our victory..."
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to go to negotiations after torturing Ukrainians, but "we must not lose the opportunity for diplomatic resolution if we have it".
Direct speech: "People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end."
Under our conditions, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something - and I don't think any peace on any terms will satisfy them.
But if we speak non-emotionally, the war should end with peace, or end with millions of casualties.
And even where there are millions of victims, everything comes to an end with the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight - but for the sake of life.
"You can't fight for the sake of dust when there is nothing left, no people."
Good day, do you still have available spots for the Czech course for adults at 7:00 pm on Tuesday?
Upon request, you can meet your family in Kutna Hora.
And these two are my cousins.
Yes, I understand.
I'm not sure if I can clean up before 1:00 PM because there's a large apartment and a lot to clean.
I'll try to clean up quickly, but I don't promise.
I will write to you when the apartment is ready for guests.
Dominika, who is responsible for purchasing consumables?
Is this procedure permanent, or do we need to order as it runs out?
Due to the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts are needed to describe its new qualitative state.
The analysis of the metaphorical space in Ukrainian literature, research of the state.
The use of Ukrainian poetic metaphor in contemporary literature allows for the analysis of the postmodern context as a whole, where metaphor plays a role as an axiological criterion.
Do you know how to report online that I have found a job and no longer require assistance?
I don't have the opportunity to go in person(((((( Thank you, this form needs to be printed out to fill it in.
Do you not know when it is possible to live there?

Children are the meaning of our life. You never get tired of it. Good night.
Don't change the subject. I'm asking you directly now, do you want to continue communicating? If not, then write to me already.
Moreover, we go to work and save money.
On Monday we will have a leadership meeting and we will decide how and when we will hold something in our place.
Good because I have already realized that I misunderstood something and went the wrong way.
I think this is the right decision, it's better to have fewer people and provide quality assistance to these people, than when there are many people.
My 16-year-old daughter and I are looking for temporary shelter in the Czech Republic, where she plans to study at the University.
We have now seen each other, the conversation is more like a correspondence, but it also turned out not bad.

Of course, we will be able to come. Thank you!
5. What other education, besides Czech language courses, would you like for yourself?
Oh, how complicated everything is :)
In Ukraine, mobile operators work 24/7 in either telephone or online mode every day, regardless of holidays :)
I am going to work tomorrow morning around 6:00-6:20 and will be home after lunch.
If you have time, let's try to change the tariff plan tomorrow evening.
But today our city was bombed again and I'm afraid for my son.
And I want to escape from here as soon as possible.
Did not fully understand.
Dear brother Albert, my family and I are very grateful to you for your support and the gift you have given us!
Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
With respect, the Bezverkha family.
Okay, thank you for the conversation. I'll take a pill and go rest. Have a good sleep üôèüèª
My name is Ciara, we are from Ukraine, and I have a daughter who is 7 years old and my mother.
I'm looking for work...but there's a problem, I can't stand for long periods of time after a surgery, so it's very difficult to find something suitable for me.
I am temporarily residing in Prague 9. I am ready to move anywhere if there is work. I will be very grateful for advice or proposals.
But if you don't want to communicate with me, then I am sad.
Why did you decide that such an experience was not necessary for you?
Every situation is given for something.
Mainly, for a person to change, especially spiritually.
I will give you this money once the bank approves it.
Around 30,000 UAH for debts you have, plus 30,000 UAH left for you.
Janka, I hope all is well with you and your grandmother won't call me bad words.
I'm trying to put Sasha to sleep...It's necessary for him to get at least a little bit of rest...
The dining room needs a code.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has released a list of Russian military personnel who were involved in committing military crimes in the city of Bucha in the Kyiv region.
As reported by Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine announces this on Facebook.
"Every Ukrainian should know their names!"
According to the report, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has obtained a list of 64 servicemen from the 64th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade who are directly involved in committing military crimes against the Ukrainian people in the city of Bucha.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine states that all war criminals who have committed crimes against the peaceful population of Ukraine will stand trial and will be held accountable.
You can view the list by following the link.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel, and the entire Kyiv region have been liberated from Russian aggressors.
In liberated cities and villages, mass killings of civilians by Russian military have been recorded.
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoly Fedoruk, announced that 280 people were buried in communal graves.
The Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova stated that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilian residents were taken out from the territory liberated from Russian aggressors in the Kyiv region.
On February 24, the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian invaders' troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure objects, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas in Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, ballistic missiles, and air bombs.
Good day, I apologize, but I won't be able to work with you as I will be flying to Canada in the near future.
Immediately after the hyphen, there are formal names, after the slash - slang expressions, in parentheses - abbreviations used on the schedule.
I don't want to bother you, rest.
I checked the weather forecast. It will be cold.
I don't need brands.
Simply nice clothing at reasonable prices and with sizes available.
We were in the store at the railway station.
Professions that are offered. Is it possible without knowing the language?
This is important, if there is such a tradition, then I need to know so that I can prepare.
"I was thinking about it for a week, but the situation is heating up here, with constant sirens."
Tomorrow there may be bad communication on the road.
I am grateful to every person for the experience, even if it is painful.
I consider that I gained experience from each situation for myself in order not to repeat mistakes in the future.
Directives are made in the form of numbered written supplements that are part of this Regulation.
I am confident that there will be no problem with this.
In Ukraine, many people celebrate this week as well.
It depends on the religion.
Is the person Greek Catholic or Catholic?
At the beginning, you can try it for free.
"Can you write us the payment algorithm, we will pay ourselves."
The paper that children receive at the end of the school year is a report card, and birth and marriage certificates are obtained separately.
Yes! He drives on it like an experienced driver! But I don't know if that's better. I'm worried about the walls of the apartment.
They write there that you need to fill out a "curriculum vitae" in Czech...
I'll try to make it on time. Because I still have to sign documents at the city hall.
Wife does not get angry that you are on your phone.
In my daily prayers, I thank God and the Virgin Mary for you.
May they envelop you with their blanket of love and warmth on this night.
My heart belongs to you.
Are you okay if I come immediately after the war?
The location, day, and time will be specified according to interests and availability.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
"I'm fine, I have money for two months of rent, the district in Olomouc doesn't matter, I would be very grateful."
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of savage abuse of civilians to the north of Kyiv.
The photographs of people who were beaten and shot have shocked the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people are asking each other how could such a thing happen in the 21st century?! How?!
But nothing really surprised me. Exactly what I was sad and waiting for is happening...
I evacuated children and elderly parents from Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then the female colleagues with children left, and only after that he returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have consistently been helping the Ukrainian Armed Forces and have never doubted for a moment that if the suburbs of Kyiv were occupied, my family would not be spared.
Because I have been and remain absolutely confident that the essence of the rotten Communo-KGBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was executed in the prison of the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, in the Zhovti Vody SBU, they were given a copy of the execution case of my great-grandfather: the whole case was over a hundred pages, but the verdict for execution was very simple and therefore even more frightening.
The accused was illiterate and denied his guilt.
He was an ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was from free people, a poor "one-household" nobility, and never went to serfdom.
The fact that they lived on farmsteads and had a few cows was sufficient to condemn the plowman and caretaker of minor children to death.
Relatives didn't even find out about the burial place.
Grandma said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed, except for two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case there is the surname of the informant Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and wouldn't be surprised if his relative was a KGB informant.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, as it is known...
The execution trio that sentenced the peasants to execution were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing my great-grandfather's case, I became interested in various informational resources.
There are wonderful (without sarcasm) informational resources in Russia, such as "Immortal Barracks", which qualitatively remind about the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of NKVD officers have found ways to punish and destroy almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who discovered mass graves of victims of Stalin's repression and publicly wrote the names of killers were first discredited and then destroyed by the system.
Supposedly, files with child pornography were found on the computer, and he was imprisoned for it, but he quickly died there.
KGB agents are still murdering those who try to uncover the truth about the crimes of the last century.
What are you suddenly surprised about their actions now?!
There are concentrated the most disgusting traits of human nature.
Slavery and imperial chauvinism overlaid on top of the thousand-year-old Ordynska tradition during the 16th to 19th centuries.
And then a bestial genetic experiment was carried out on what had been created, slicing away intelligence during several waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Chekist" from 1992, that's how it all was.
"Did you see my bikini photos?"
Can you ask your wife what I can buy for coughing?
Sorry, but I have nobody to ask.
I still wanted to ask if you know where the children went, because Galia cannot find them.
Lyubosh, Igor asks if it is convenient for you to travel tomorrow? (He has a day off and can go, because the car has not been checked at the station today.)
It is very inconvenient for us to bother you so much.
You are very helpful to us, thank you!!
During the demolition of the debris of two multi-story residential buildings in Borodianka near Kyiv, the bodies of 7 civilians were found.
Defenders of Mariupol reported the spraying of an unknown toxic substance above the city from a Russian drone.
Three people were injured.
Approximately 1700 Ukrainian defenders and civilians are held in Russian prisons.
Among them - 500 women.
Germany will allocate 1 million euros to support the International Criminal Court, which is investigating war crimes committed by the Russian army in Ukraine.
Canada has imposed sanctions on 33 Russian defense sector companies.
During the past day of fighting in eastern Ukraine, one enemy tank, three armored vehicles, three artillery systems, 24 units of automotive equipment, one helicopter, and three unmanned aerial vehicles were destroyed.
"Your coffee will arrive today."
I have my first "bicycle" after my son.
What do girls do after they return from school?
We arrived at the place where we were accommodated outside of the center in Pardubice, the conditions are good.
But there is a big "but" here - men who drink alcohol and smoke inside live here, loud music is the minimum of what "upset" us, the smell of cigarettes, drunken men, and us with children... it's scary to go to bed, to be honest.
Please help with accommodation, for money, please.
But where it will be safe and not smokey.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is so strong, as if they are actually smoking here.
I beg of you very much, one of them is barely standing on his feet, screaming something, something is wrong with him. It's very scary.
I just ask and pray for help, if you can üôèüèº.
The main thing is that we understood each other.
Very positive, such a wonderful kindergarten, such pleasant educators.
"You do so much for us, it's incredible, very grateful to you‚ù§Ô∏è"
Good evening Stephanie, Agatha wants to take part in the game, she missed playing üòâ
We don't reach that hatch.
For now, we're not ready to pay such money, we'll wait for help and then plan something.
How do I get to the apartment today to clean it?
When I'm at the main entrance, should I notify you and you'll open it?
I wanted to if I have time to take a look at the cake for Karina.
I forgot to write to you, sorry.
Yesterday everything went very well.
We were talking about children with special needs and the system of their education in Ukraine.
When Mrs. Shakhova introduced me as an Fpoint employee, the first question was how we found the dog, how we found the pug.
Everyone is following the page on Facebook.
They asked to convey greetings to you and say that they find reading news very interesting.
They were talking about people of Romani nationality who have privileges in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if a child comes and the parents do not understand Czech at all, then after work I can help them over the phone.
I need to change the bedding, two sets.
This suits me especially during festive days.
I have free time, and we only go to Easter rituals.
Thank you üèµÔ∏èüèµÔ∏èüèµÔ∏è, today I will write down my work data.
I really enjoyed the data, thank you for the organization.
So far, Nestor only has a runny nose, and Galinka has a temperature of 37.7 in the evening and 38 during the day.
The queue is moving very slowly for General Chapak there.
Everyone has a chance.
The main thing is that love is real and mutual.
I don't know about Europe, but in our country, people get married for various reasons, mostly for selfish, mercenary purposes.
And I have a problem with this, if I don't love a person nothing will work out.
Yes, we took her home and dropped her off to her aunt immediately.
She was very grateful, she even cried.
I was telling her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
I said that if possible, there may be an old blanket and pillow.
But it is not necessary. Only if it happens. I am also very grateful to you.
I always felt sorry for him.
They killed my best friend in front of him.
I had many questions for God, why situations were happening in my life that simply made me lose faith in everything.
And do small grocery stores work? I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go and you made a meeting.
It is so, but we are still not familiar with the area and do not know where everything is located. Today we were searching for a supermarket for an hour and had to walk back. Two of the blankets are not suitable, so we need two large-sized ones.
Even now, I was thinking about you, and you wrote to me.
Does your dad only know how to communicate in Russian or does anyone else in the family?
It is possible for the children to come to Valya and play in the hallway.
Well, then let's take a risk :)
I'm also glad to have met you.
I talked to Volodymyr about accommodation and asked if I should wait for them to find something or look for it myself. The women living with us also advised us to go to the metro station "Muzeyna" where there is an institution that helps find accommodation.
For the little one, I will cross the barrier üòÇüôÉüòÇ.
For some of their questions, I didn't know the answers.
"It would have been good on Thursday if possible."
I cannot call the physician because I have not yet completed the examination for the food license.
But I cannot call him because I have run out of money on my account.
I cannot top up my phone because I do not understand Czech online banking, and my Ukrainian bank card cannot be used for topping up.
In the Vodafone app, I am unable to change my tariff to have normal calls and internet, and also unable to top up my number.
I'm going crazy.
"Where the price doesn't shock, but the face... The title sounds incorrect, what did you mean?"
I feel ashamed to be unemployed.
Just wrote that I'm in school during class.
Sorry for bothering, I was just very worried.
And this is closer to when they leave the borders of Ukraine, to know for sure that they will arrive.
Because now everyone's life is in question.
Yes. It's for size 10-11 years old. But our sizes don't match. Everything needs to be measured.
I am looking for everything for home and for the child.
Thanks to the people who accepted me. I live in a chapel and they always ask if I need anything, but I'm too shy to ask and try to find things myself.
I just arrived home, now having breakfast :)
Don't explain anything, please, just act like I'm not here.
It is impossible to answer without a sent resume.
Mom, I won't be able to tell you something like that :)
And I'm really a bit out of sorts right now that I couldn't hold back my feelings before we left the apartment... Like tonight at night...
God willing, Yura will fall asleep üôè Maybe I will also go to bed then, to get some rest.
I will write to you in any case.
Hello. Suzana, please help me. I received payment for March. Is it for both of us - me and Yulia or just for me? I can't figure out why the payment is for this amount.
Yes, you can make copies of passports when it is convenient for you :)
In our village, we have one of the best high schools in the region.
üòÇüòãI'm already having fun talking to you, and I even like it üòâ.
I turned to Caritas and they offered temporary accommodation for a week or two, but I need permanent housing where I could be with my child, and why there is always less and less of it.
The flowers were blooming. Everything is normal. Everyone rested and looked very nice.
As reported by "European Truth", Welt writes about this with reference to sources in the Ukrainian government circles.
According to the publication, the relevant proposal was sent to the Ministry of Economy of Germany on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including the training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As also proposed are howitzers in the variant on the Boxer APC for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in battle have to get relatively close to the enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at distances over 30 kilometers.
According to Ukrainian government sources citing KMW's proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will proceed in a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide 100 of its howitzers to Kiev in the shortest term possible, and the gaps that have formed will be filled with industry during the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered within 30 months after signing the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
The complete supply will not be completed until 2027.
And is it in the first half of the day or in the second half of the day together?
Thank you, we will find out how to replenish the account and I will get back to you. Thank you.
I am going to work tomorrow without having to pass the commission, but tell me, when my doctor recovers, I will pass the commission, did I understand correctly?
How can I now change my T-Mobile tariff package to 4 gigabytes for 249 crowns?
Hello, I'm sorry. I wanted to know if you need a worker?
You can either wash the floor or the dishes.
I am from Ukraine, unfortunately I don't know the language, but I need work.
I am young and active, I am 21 years old.
I will agree to any job.
"I speak Czech at a basic level, but I am learning every day, so I think that I will learn everything necessary to work without any problems."
I think I've talked to you enough today - it's probably time for you to go to sleep so you can work tomorrow.
If possible, I will take these pants for work. The size suits me.
You are smart and everything will be fineüôè Rest, gain strength, and beauty with a good sleep!!!üá∫üá¶‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üáø
On her birthday, a roller-skater tries to end her life by jumping off the Charles Bridge.
Did you manage to chat with someone?
So we wanted to resolve the issue with the Easter card. We don't have internet banking and we don't know how to set it up. What do we need to do?
Should we reach out to the owner of the place where we live?
Say goodbye always when you leave.
Sure, we can meet after 5 p.m.
Can I wash laundry in the apartment tomorrow and hang it to dry in the garage?
Hello. Yes, I will be waiting for you at 6 o'clock.
How long did you study for this specialty?
If it was warm, it would be very good.
I submitted an online application. I'll try to go today after work.
"We are doing well. We can handle the heating from the stove, we have experience in Ukraine, we have gas, but since it is very expensive, we heat the stove with firewood."
Good day, Lena, please tell me where is the stationery store nearby.
Tomorrow we are going to Prague to look at an apartment.
Everything has been resolved on its own.
I have to take Karinka with me.
I have put the laundry to wash, came home and saw a note on the chair near the washing machine saying that there is a repair of the channel and it is unsure if it is safe to use the machine or if it needs to be turned off.
It says that my status will change within 24 hours. But why? What kind of comedy is this? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"Ex-husband cannot calm down, he writes me poems) a real drama."
How I want everything that officially connects us with him to end as soon as possible üôè.
Thank you because something is not going well for us here.
And we even have a product from the cradle.
Sorry means I messed something up.
"I didn't understand Czech well back then."
I probably made something up for myself.
Correct, they go to school like this because three of them, Halyna and Sviatoslav, are studying remotely and will finish school in Ukraine and receive diplomas in the fall. They will need to apply to universities then.
Can you please tell me how to get to the city center?
I'll share my thoughts with you.
For me, marriage is the mystery of two people who do not discuss each other with their relatives or friends.
A man and a woman decide on their family matters themselves, especially without involving their relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we will be close.
Why not try it this way for now?
I rented a car for 9 people, we will come with Mariana and your family.
How much time do you have? What time do we need to leave?
So, I'm glad to listen to jazz.
Thank you, I am working with this application. They spoke about it in our Czech language course on Wednesday.
For the past four years, I haven't let anyone get close to me, read many philosophy books, and sorted things out within myself.
When someone hurts you badly, it's hard for you to trust them.
But it is necessary to try again, everyone goes through something that changes them forever, that's life.
Martine, we are already going to bed.
Thank you for such a nice and joyful day.
We really liked everything.
We feel ourselves like in our own family.
The children told their dad and all the grandparents all evening how much they enjoyed being with you.
Greetings from the girls! We send our best wishes for the holidays üòâ
But where were we looking now.
I hope that my son will come out of this meat grinder alive.
Let's go today, maybe something will be needed.
How can I contact them to get them to open the door?
Is there any improvement in overcoming the coronavirus?
Very grateful for helping people. If you can, please help us find affordable housing.
We are now in Slapy, our friends sheltered us for a while.
My family: husband, 6-year-old daughter, 11-year-old son.
The man has already found a job as a driver.
I am a massage therapist, rehabilitation specialist looking for a job.
In order for the children to attend school and for me to work, we need housing close to civilization.
"I simply needed to submit it today!"
Nothing. We'll wait until tomorrow. I didn't know that even big stores would be closed.
I prepare cabbage rolls like this: in a pot, I mix 3-4 tablespoons of tomato paste with 0.5 liters of water, and bring it to a boil.
I place the cabbage rolls in a pot and pour this sauce over them.
Roast in the oven for approximately 1.5 hours.
How much money do I have on this number?
I have to bring all of this.
From Monday the 4th.
In 2022, refugees from the war in Ukraine may apply for humanitarian aid at the new job location of the Labor Management at Prague Market.
The branch in hall No. 29 is designated specifically for the submission and processing of requests for assistance, so there is a translator on site.
Lidia has already been accepted to school, but due to illness, we will go on Tuesday. I informed the teacher today.
I'm sitting, holding headphones on my ears, listening to music and thinking about you and the children.
I really want to be with you.
To make you happy üò¢.
"I don't know, my dear, how are you?"
I know it's hard for you.
But I approach it as us being together. As us being a couple.
I would say that after the war there will be a lot of work.
That's why I'm not afraid of not finding her there.
I know how to do many things.
Therefore, I am not afraid that I did not end up in any of them.
I just don't know how it will be with housing. üò¢üò¢üòü
I need to undergo examination to obtain a food license. Can I do it with you?
Please advise, tomorrow I have to prepare the apartment for 5 guests.
Fifth place, I understand, is in the room with the television?
To unfold and make the sofa bed?
Can we stay with you while Mrs. Margarita finds us accommodation?
Don't worry about it.
Not new, already used, but it works, but not needed.
Write the address in Czech, and let's see on the map where it is located from us.
I don't know how much free space there is, so I can't plan anything with the furniture. I want to finally look at that apartment this week and then understand what furniture I need.
I'm sorry for responding so late, it was a working day, and it was difficult to adapt.
Is this enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I finally want to be with you, to have the opportunity to hug you.
To kiss you in the morning, to tell you how well it suits you.
For the child, there is already a crib and a bathtub here, and I have found things for the first time.
Don't forget that you promised to help me when you have the opportunity, but don't give up the last üòüüòâüôÉü§´
I want to get a haircut called "the hat."
Oleg got sick - he has a fever and a cough. It's better not to bring Yana with you to us, so that she doesn't get infected.
I'll just be a little late - around 8. Is it okay?
I don't want any misunderstandings with you.
Because I'm worried that everything will be okay!?
Because with these excursions, we didn't even talk about it!
I understand how important it is for you!
And as for myself, I remain silent (for me it is simply an unattainable summit)!
How do you feel today? üòÖ after celebrating?
Hello, sorry, I just woke up, slept poorly.
Sorry to bother you.
I was upset that we started translating the test poorly with Kolya yesterday.
I will ask either Hryhoriy Denysenko or maybe Jonashek to help me with mathematical concepts, even just a little.
Maybe I can be useful to them somehow?
If possible, I want to review mathematical terms over the weekend.
Geometry is generally difficult, but we have to work with Kolya to make it error-free.
Thank you for the testing tasks.
We also hope for this very much.
In fact, she is very happy with any gift.
I would like to connect the internet to my Czech number.
Yesterday at the stop for bus 402, I met a Ukrainian woman named Viktoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is alone... her eyes are full of tears and sorrow...
I could not stay aside.
Now we have agreed to be friends.
And yesterday evening I thanked God for this girl, because she was the first person from Ukraine who I felt mutual affection with.
Branch in Hall ‚Ññ29 is designated specifically for the submission and processing of applications for assistance.
It turned out that I ordered a spare card.
It's not worth it, I'm just a regular person.
So that she wouldn't be afraid that nobody came.
"I did not go. Yes, I baked it myself. I can do it! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven."
So, are you leaving the city for a long time?
Six months ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we honored the 80th anniversary of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babyn Yar.
I had the honor of speaking after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke about the "common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and live in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
"We must protect this foundation - it is also part of our responsibility, linked to our history."
"If the 'evil demons of the past appear today in a new outfit,' he said, 'then for us Germans, there can only be one answer: never again!'"
"The struggle must continue."
Today, Russia attacked a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of civilians, starving the residents of cities it has blockaded and letting them die from diseases.
Russian forces are carrying out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually reminiscent of the shootings in Babi Yar.
Germans have been seeing this in the news in real time for over a month.
Yes, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which was recently impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons necessary for Ukraine.
But "Never again!" doesn't just mean opposing the swastika.
This means to fight with all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes, and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to overcome evil and stop the atrocities that are happening in Ukraine.
I will sing you one lullaby.
We agree, arrange for the tour and let us know when to be gathered.
Everyone was sick except for Lydia. They had a new variant of COVID called Omicron.
Then I will do it tomorrow.
I use this ticket instead of a card.
Apologize for the delayed documents.
The ticket cost me 2000 hryvnias from the conductor.
Sergiy Sydorenko: Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a distant perspective.
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea, and the beginning of the war in Donbas, the number of opponents of NATO began to decrease, while supporters, on the contrary, began to increase.
After the start of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among citizens of Ukraine - over 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's entry into NATO and the assistance provided by NATO during the war, there is now a lot of criticism aimed at the Alliance and its member countries for the delayed supply of weapons, refusal to close the airspace, and reluctance to "annoy" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its aspirations for membership in the Alliance due to Russia's position if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "Cursed Questions" together with the editor of "European Truth", we talk about how exactly the Alliance helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for, and what the Alliance is criticized for in vain, why our perspective of joining NATO is closer than ever in history and why security guarantees discussed in negotiations with Russia could become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is here?
In my Volt partner, it is marked that my application is under consideration.
I submitted it through this mobile application.
We don't have visas, we need to go to the congress center and find out how to do it because it was processed in Poland where they wouldn't give visas, but they provided a PESSEL.
We will definitely write to you!
Denys went today in a good mood.
Agreed with the boy from Ukraine, whom I met yesterday, to meet near the school so that he could show me everything.
So I hope that everything is okay with him.
Because this is not how I love, I don't have enough for long.
It is reported in Ukraine that the Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks and infantry combat vehicles to Ukraine.
I am leaving the children alone, waiting there for 3-4 hours and then going home because I cannot leave them any longer.
And take with you a 6-7 year old child in the morning.
Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had sincere feelings towards this person, but he acted improperly and I left him.
After some time, he returned again and asked me for forgiveness.
I refused him.
Then after some time he called to say that he had undergone a heart surgery.
Simply asking to talk to him made me feel sorry for him.
I emotionally supported him for almost half a year.
During this time, we communicated a lot.
At that time, I also had problems at work simultaneously.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual assistance.
And I started to think that maybe I needed to look at it differently.
And he proposed to me to get married, and two days later he died.
Therefore, God himself decided our fates.
What does being ready for marriage mean to you?
And he speaks only in Czech.
I wanted to say that I managed to find accommodation, and I am very happy about it ‚ò∫ now I have a place to live and a place to be with my child.
Should you have mentioned me earlier?
)) Because I helped to look after children in the family.
Don't apologize. Just write which sentences you didn't understand.
I myself understand that the translator doesn't always translate the text correctly.
I don't know how to talk to the doctor or if she should give me a paper?
They probably forgot it, I put it in the closet.
You probably need to go to bed in order to work tomorrow.
Can someone help with needed things for a woman who wears size XS or S and is 165 cm tall? Also, for her daughters (8, 10, 12 years old). Thank you.
That time at Lidl I bought two packs and my mom bought two.
It's very kind of you, thank you.
You lifted my mood.
Okay, let's talk about something else. I'm not sleeping anyway, I'm still dozing off and dreaming that bombs are exploding...
God never delays, there is a time and place for everything.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
"I perfectly understand the value of unskilled labor and I understand that I will not be able to have the same type of job that I had back home in Kiev here, and the money that I earned back home, I won't be earning here."
But simply sitting and doing nothing is not an option for me, because then all sorts of negative thoughts creep into my head, so I need to engage in some physical activity.
Documents are processed at the airport from 7am to 7pm, at other times you can simply wait.
Volodymyr returned at 4 in the morning.
That's why we took them with us.
We fell asleep with Vika in the kitchen, they moved her to the bedroom.
I will finish work and go to the airport with them.
"When he is with you, write and you will find out what happens next..."
I can't find a place for myself anymore.
Sir, please, these are invitations for Ukrainian children who will be entering the gymnasium.
Yes, but I find it difficult to do.
Ok, write to me when it's convenient üòò
I don't know about work yet. Of course, I would like to if I can get my children into kindergarten and school.
We planned it this way. Would it be better if we sometimes changed the changes?
I'm sorry. I really don't have any missed calls since Wednesday. I apologize, can we arrange for another time?
I offer a job, cleaning the bathroom and toilet, washing 3 windows, wiping dust.
Work for approximately 3-4 hours. A one-time payment of 800 UAH. Starting on Tuesday, April 19th at 2:00 PM.
I hope to tell you just now that everything is fine with us.
Can I call you?
Or can you write the contact of your wife?
Hryshko started coughing, I want to ask what I can buy at the pharmacy.
I want to ask for advice.
In Ukrainian: "Our equivalent of the name 'Anna' is considered to be the indigenous form of the name, 'Hanna'."
Her uncle gave it to her from the house.
We made an English version and added new partners.
Write to him if anything is needed.
Just don't forget about me, please üôèüèª
Do the classes on Monday and Wednesday differ from each other?
Thank you very much. You do a lot for our family! We are all infinitely grateful to you.
You need a permit to be in the pool.
But that's just my opinion.
My uncle gave her roller skates and a board for riding from our house, and she was riding them at home, so this is it.
I also woke up at 9 o'clock, and only now am I preparing breakfast.
I am very sorry that you are communicating with me on your day off. I hope I am not too annoying.
We want to inform about a change of residence and, at the same time, submit documents to renew the card.
We are now providing medical oxygen to all hospitals in our country.
And I forgot to tell you that there will be a snack tomorrow.
One mother said that she will bake donuts with jam for the children.
He comes to visit you.
Please tell me if you have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments for the coming month, even for a rough idea of which days?
I just can't memorize this schedule :)
The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev, saying "they have not done this before."
Konashenkov's straightforward statement: "We see attempts of sabotage and strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects located on the territory of the Russian Federation.
"If such cases continue, then the armed forces of the RF will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army refrained from earlier."
Russians launched missile strikes on Kyiv from the very first days of the full-scale invasion of occupational troops of the Russian Federation into Ukraine.
On February 25, remnants of Russian missiles that were shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell onto a multi-story apartment building in the Poznyaky district of the capital.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a multi-storey building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1st, Russians hit a TV tower near Babyn Yar in Dorohozhychi, as a result of which 5 pedestrians were killed.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying towards the Ministry of Defense building near the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, fragments of a downed occupier's rocket smashed a house and a trolleybus in Kurenivka, Kyiv.
On March 18th, a Russian rocket hit a residential area in Vinohradar, resulting in one person's death and 19 others being injured, including four children.
On March 21st, Russian rockets completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center in Vinohradar, resulting in the deaths of at least 4 people.
The Mayor of Kyiv Vitaliy Klitschko once again stated on April 13 that it is still too early for the residents of the capital who have been evacuated from the city to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians are still capable of launching missile strikes against Kiev, and there are also a lot of landmines and unexploded ordnance on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that Russians are planning to carry out a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to blame Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army towards civilians.
On April 1st, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, supposedly due to an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, the local authorities of Belgorod claimed that a "Ukrainian shell" had allegedly fallen near the city.
Obviously, the elites in both Washington and Berlin break out in cold sweat at the very thought of NATO fighters shooting down Russian bombers in the sky over Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much with them as with their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of crowds of thousands in the squares of the largest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not persuade European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces European peoples who elect those politicians to do so.
And these speeches, this delicate combination of strength, emotion, and sometimes despair, gradually achieve their goal.
While Biden is strongly against the closing of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Whether Paris or Brussels are against speeding up Ukraine's accession process, but this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want you to consider us as fraudsters.
The money you collect is better to give to people who are in greater need.
I can come to you and we will solve everything on the spot. It doesn't matter to me, as long as I can help.
But the air is clean, that's a plusüòÄ.
It says there that I have the tariff "Together for Two without Internet", but I actually asked for Internet instead.
I don't understand the terms of the tariff.
Do we have any additional premises today or just the stairs as always, from the top down?
So I'm already on my way and what about you, are you taking the train?
But I will never stop loving you, you are everything to me.
This loan is handled by a financial consultant.
So it takes a few days for this.
Katya asked about the internet, can she be given the password?
"I thought you and Milan didn't meet each other."
Great then my husband will give me a ride because today he has a company car from the construction company where he works.
We are very happy and grateful that our daughter Nika and grandchildren are under your protection!
Thank you very much for the invitation!
We also hope that after the war we can invite you to Ukraine!
One needs to cut it into 4 parts.
One of these particles can be used for 2-3 days, but rinse every hour.
I am interested in architecture and local flavor.
I am very glad that everything is fine with you.
Most likely, at 4:20 pm, the concert will start at 6, and after it, I will be free again.
And now I want to eat something sweet.
So I'll make tea and hug some candies.
I went to the school page and now I will try to order Ani's lunch for tomorrow.
But I love to go for a walk on weekends.
Can we go there tomorrow to find out the conditions?
My name is Sasha and I came from Luhansk to Prague.
I am a certified massage therapist and nurse with 27 years of experience in neurology.
I offer therapeutic massages and a rehabilitation gym for children and adults.
I speak Ukrainian, Russian and Czech languages and I am learning intensively.
Contact: ------ would like a letter so that the Czechs can write to you through a translator, SMS does not work here, they do not have a Ukrainian keyboard, and if they call, you will not be able to communicate.
Do you really not want this price list?
He really helps people to see what they are worth and what they have to do for it.
If you don't need a price list, I won't provide it.
Tell me how you want it, and I will do it.
By the way, did you not want to write to me today ... for some reason?
Don't worry, I didn't come to ask for anything.
More precisely - today I only ask for attention.
I have a lot to say today, so I ask for your patience.
Is your imagination doing well?
You live your usual life, go to work, plan purchases, vacation.
You have dreams.
You are planning to buy that dress you saw yesterday in the mall.
Tomorrow evening, after work.
Your brain can't perceive this.
He's clinging to the old reality.
You are calling work to find out if you need to go to work today or not.
You have decided to leave the children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There is hope... it's not for long.
Now... negotiating... something will happen.
The brain refuses to perceive...
Where to go? I have no one and nowhere.
I have $50 in my pocket. We spent everything else at home.
Many of our leaders did not provide us with a salary for our work.
Where should I go?? Who needs me? How do I provide for my children? Where should I live?
You are not able to take many things.
"You didn't take practically anything from home... you have to travel 1000 kilometers."
"You don't know if you will have something to feed them tomorrow or not."
Every day, from morning till evening, you are dragging your children all over Prague.
And what's next? Unknown. How long? Unknown. The children are asking for sweets. And you can't. It's expensive for you.
And from every iron - we don't have such thing.
We have a choice - to stay there and put children in danger, or to try to save ourselves here.
"She was very pleased with the hearts and things that the children gave her when she came to school."
You needed to call me when you arrived.
I will write to you in the evening.
Yes, I only believe in God and entrust my life to Him.
I already don't have the strength for all of this.
I thought you had fallen in love with some Ukrainian girl and didn't have time to communicate üòá
I have studied the menu, and even placed an order already.
2. Would you be interested in joint events with your Czech neighbors, friends, community?
If so, then of what specific type, species.
Please send the page with the visa or entry stamp (red with date).
Without visa-free access for refugees, we cannot provide humanitarian assistance.
Mrs. Libushe, did you pay for daycare?
Because I can't understand.
You do so much good for us...
We are in great debt to you... thank you!
Yes, I understand that it is very good.
Now I'll send you a photo of the business card of the lady whom I teach English to.
"So what will you write tomorrow, shall we meet or not, maybe your plans will change..."
Good morning. We have enough resources. It would be really good to know someone from Ukraine.
If you want, you can be with me after work.
Are you busy tomorrow? Do you want to meet up after 4:00 pm?
What are your overall impressions of the first week?
Karina brought us medicine the day before yesterday and we are taking it.
I can work with bedridden patients and disabled children.
But it is necessary to indicate that I only speak Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have anything like that.
Can I ask you for soap for the bathroom?
Because there is only antibacterial gel there.
Exactly can't say, because I'm not very familiar with the city.. around half past 12.
What services/activities do you think are needed/missing for elderly people?
I don't know because I haven't received any text messages from the bank yet, and I haven't picked up my bank card yet. Also, my children deleted the banking application and this made me very sad.
Then please write to me how you will be traveling üôèüèª
Today we have joy - our town of Bucha was liberated from the occupiers, our troops succeeded.
There is a sweep against the enemy - they are searching for Russians in basements and apartments.
The entire city is mined, demining work will begin.
And Ivan looked to see if there was anything that needed repairing or finishing.
Diano, as you wish. Maybe he will be ashamed, I don't know.
Panas wants to stay at home, saying that he is getting tired of us and wants to be alone when we go somewhere without him.
We will bake Mazanets and do lessons.
These are small business owners who have opened volunteer headquarters in their premises and shops.
These are tractor drivers who practically go out to the field under fire, because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who agree to travel in convoys today to temporarily occupied territories to deliver aid and transport people from there.
These are heroic conductors who fearlessly travel to the zone of military operations, comfort and assist refugees on trains, and help volunteers load humanitarian aid into wagons at peaceful stations.
These are gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the first few days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are municipal workers who, despite being under fire, collect trash, repair water and power lines, to provide people with essentials.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day, without complaining about anything, and in their free time they also volunteer, collecting first aid kits for the front line.
In Ukraine, the juice stops when there are only small leaves.
Please tell me, small children - what age do you have in mind?
"My daughter is 8 years old, is that an acceptable age?"
I am looking for accommodation for myself and my daughter for 3-4 days to come to Czech Republic and submit passports for Canadian visa processing.
In Warsaw, there are a lot of people at the visa center and the online queue is not working.
"I wanted to come for one day, but it's far away and the train ride takes a lot of time, it will be difficult for the child."
Therefore, she decided to search for accommodations in Prague or nearby.
No, we are all satisfied.
Where to record yesterday's readings/instruments?
But I can't change my password when I follow the link because it gives me an error.
This is in the microwave, something was burning there.
In Ukraine, operators of the largest banks are always in touch with customers 24/7 and all questions are promptly resolved :)
Well, I'll get used to the new realities.
I am very sorry and I want you to know that.
You can edit the post. The most important thing is that there is truth in it.
So, the television is overflowing with this.
We have already agreed on the refrigerators, some Czech guys responded and will come at 1 pm to help move them.üëçüëçüëç
I want to go to you. Hug you tightly. And kiss you. üòò
At 7:30 in May, I am reading the history of world theatre to actors, directors and theatre experts.
In the evening, I evaluate projects. After that, I have dinner.
Hryshko is still sleeping, he cried a lot at night, his tooth is coming out.
Right now I'm on the phone with all my acquaintances from Lviv, many people have died.
Czech Republic started issuing visas after March 22, I think.
Until then, they used to put such stamps and then equated these stamps to a cart.
The Overseas Electoral District of Ukraine (OED Ukraine) is an electoral district that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of premises for voting in embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises on military bases abroad where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents are located (Kosovo and DR Congo). [1] The role of the district election commission for the overseas electoral district is performed by the Central Election Commission.
Only nationwide voting is held in the Foreign Electoral District: the elections of the President and People's Deputies and all-Ukrainian referendums.
Local elections are not held in higher education institutions.
They are at the train station near the room of the mother and child.
It says that they no longer understand where to go.
Are you angry with me?
I'll go delete the photo in a swimsuit.
"I don't need money anymore, I loaned it to a friend for a long term üòä"
I wanted to say that I've already connected a Czech mobile number.
For this, I did not need another device, I visited the O2 operator and they made me an electronic SIM card, which I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
Thank you. It's very inconvenient for me to work on Sundays and I can't do it anymore.
You said that your washing machine is broken. Take it for yourself. You also need it very much.
We do not have enough blankets, down comforters, or plates. The children do not have pajamas and have nothing to change into.
Good morning, I will be leaving at 10...please send the address again, I seem to have lost the text message.
I don't want to torture neither you nor myself, I'll figure it out somehow inside of me.
That would have been good, but I know there were no free seats there, and in principle, now they have all their lessons according to the schedule and they are learning quite well.
Do you have a meat grinder to make minced meat? We have one, but it's not working.
Well, let Easter already pass.
Yesterday, did your mother say that something was hurting you?
She can't tell them everything she wants, and she doesn't understand everything they say (But yesterday she came home in a great mood after that fair).
Today, I also went to school.
Today I saw Kristina's mom, but she didn't even say hello :(
Very delicious apples, what kind of variety is this?
Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak announced that Russia is starting a "fake operation" regarding weapons that are being transferred to us by allies.
Yermak's straight talk: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness, and strive to "knock down" supplies of weapons by any means."
For example, one of the latest fakes is the alleged destruction of the S-300 air defense systems transferred by Slovakia.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What's next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. Name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers allegedly surrender with weapons to allies, and it massively falls into the hands of the Russian army.
I would like to immediately warn about such fakes.
Because the weapon in the hands of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exclusively sends the enemy to the other world.
Excuse me please, I forgot to ask how much the kindergarten will cost per month and whether it will be open during the summer?
To each according to their ability.
There are much sadder stories, believe me.
So, I had to experience such events in order to change.
In Torah it is written that God created the evil tendency within humans, so that throughout their life journey they could change spiritually and become better.
This is your home, you can invite anyone you want :)
How can we find this lady on social media? Tomorrow before going to the hospital, we wanted to visit the town hall.
He listened to his mom and didn't come with us.
I know it wasn't easy for you.
And I'll do everything to make you happy.
After what you wrote to me today, I am happy.
I hope you were serious about it. üíû
"I've been looking at a lot of ads and they're all taken. It's tough now, that's our fate."
Sorry, I didn't fully understand the question.

Good day. Victor approved this house but he doesn't know how to help this gentleman with the documents to receive payment from the government. He mentioned that there are currently no furniture available from the bank.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence emerged of Russian forces committing atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, while Moscow dismissed these reports as a "provocation."
"The reports of Ukrainian civilians being killed, raped, and seriously injured by Russian forces deserve condemnation," said the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, to journalists in Wellington on April 4th.
"Russia must be held accountable to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents a "violation of international law."
Statements were made after reports emerged that hundreds of civilians had been shot and dumped into mass graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev in Bucha by Russian forces who occupied the area for several weeks.
Photos allegedly depicting the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied have shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron stated in a radio interview on April 4th that there are signs that Russian troops have committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed towards Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has stated that Russian troops could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," said Sanchez in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova dismissed the allegations as a "provocation."
She stated without proof that the United States and NATO "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first few minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts for those who 'ordered' this story," said Zakharova.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of Russia also claimed without evidence that the images of Bucha are "another staged act of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops left the city before March 30.
Moscow has requested the UN Security Council to convene on April 4 to discuss what it called "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
On April 4, the Russian Investigative Committee released a statement announcing an "investigation" into allegations of Ukraine spreading "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
On April 3, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian forces of committing "genocide" in the city and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military has done.
"I want all leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being executed," Zelensky said in a video address, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a joint responsibility.
"For these murders, for these tortures...for shots to the back of the head," he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian military should be held responsible for the actions of their troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with tied hands and beheaded, I don't understand," he said about the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a town approximately 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
On April 2nd, a correspondent of the Ukrainian service of Radio Free Europe saw bodies of supposedly civilian people on the streets of a small town.
Only in one place did the journalist see up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various locations in Bucha.
The bodies of a group of nine civilians were scattered on the ground near a location which, according to local residents, was used by Russian forces as a base.
It seems that the victims were killed at close range.
Overall, the Ukrainian authorities stated that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the area of Kyiv that was until last week controlled by Russian forces.
Thank you, everything is here, we have bought everything on the list.
"They were told: 'There is no Kyiv.' How the occupiers treacherously exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus."
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: looting, rape, murder, torture.
There is another item on this list for which there is significantly less information at the moment - the removal of local residents to enemy territory.
From around mid-March, the Russian occupiers are "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their own territory and to the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed president Lukashenko practically gave to the Russian military range.
"Ukrainian Truth" found deported Ukrainians and their relatives to inquire about the process of the evacuation itself and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text underwent voluntary-compulsory evacuation outside of Ukraine under psychological pressure and out of necessity.
Fortunately, they are alive and maintain contact with their relatives.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were forcibly taken to Russia and Belarus.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took children without parents from there, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian swimming champion Yosyp Zachepynsky.
The family of Oleksandr, Mariana and their 10-year-old daughter Valya moved to Hostomel a few months before the war.
Oleksandr has just received a job at the "Antonov" airport located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
Homeland settled in a military town, although it was civilian.
As true scouts, Denys and Marina had gathered their anxious suitcases in advance, but they didn't have time to evacuate on the morning of February 24th.
They didn't have their own car, and suburban buses weren't taking anyone anymore.
At around 12 noon on February 24th, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit the neighboring house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks until March 17th, when Russian soldiers took them to Belarus.
In total, around 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6pm on February 24th, people entered the entrance who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian."
They ask: "Is anyone there?" - I say yes. - "Come out!".
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, if there were any weapons.
All the men were asked if they served in the army.
The women were told, "We came to protect you on Ramzan Kadyrov's order."
It was a Chechen OMON, not even the military, young guys around the age of 25-35.
They said, "Ukrainians helped us in the war, including Sasha Bily (who commanded a squadron of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking", which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - Ed.), Now we have come to help you."
On the third day they asked us what we were lacking.
We say that water was a big problem.
They have smashed the shop, took the goods from there under the pretext of "the Russians will take it anyway", and brought us 6 bottles.
There are also videos on the internet where children thank Kadir for food.
So after robbing the store, they brought back sausages and say, "We understand that it's wrong, but we really need the video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one really wanted to speak, but they made a beautiful compilation.
Our child there said, "You have 7 days to return our phones" - they laughed.
They constantly separated themselves from Russians.
They were told how good it was that they came, because they themselves did not want war, they support Ukrainians and are generally good people: "Putin is a degenerate, Kadyrov too, but we can't do anything because our families are there."
And mostly they didn't fight, but rode to loot stores and pillaged.
They brought chickens, tied one with a St. George ribbon to one leg, and the other with their white tape and called it "Opolchenka".
They came to Ukraine completely unprepared.
"I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten at Bucha so badly that they didn't even take the dead, they asked us: "Do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had assembled units - Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords to identify whether someone was a friend or foe.
"They were with us until March 13th, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Omsk airborne troops."
They placed 30-40 pieces of equipment between the buildings - our guys constantly hit it with "Bayraktars".
But these people came and told us that the Armed Forces of Ukraine no longer exist, but there is "Azov" and, according to them, "Azov" has around 100,000 soldiers in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been advancing since the beginning of March.
Some Russian man came to us - either a paratrooper officer or an FSB representative - and said there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio - they were talking about Bucha, Hostomel, and we were thinking maybe we will also get the "green corridor" treatment.
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, and they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But they tell us, "You are being taken to Belarus, and then possibly to Rostov."
We say that we don't want to go either way.
What they replied: "Then spare the mentality of your children!"
How it worked: they would push us into the basement and start shooting from under the house - either with "Grads" or mortars.
And then it flew back... The neighboring buildings just burned down, part of them collapsed.
In our house there was a direct hit on the third floor.
Later on, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to border guards and the Red Cross.
Part of them did not go, saying that it was for traitors of the Motherland - they allegedly said, "they will shoot you there and sell your organs."
"We were taken through Chernobyl, and on both sides of the road there were ruins of burnt-out equipment, although the Belarusians said that the Russians immediately take away their equipment."
A lot of trenches, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian border crossing point "Komar", we went through an improvised inspection. Many people did not have any documents at all because they had burned down.
We were accommodated in Red Cross tents and given tea.
And here we hear shots! A missile is fired, and a trail is visible - Iskander was working on Kyiv.
Although those from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, those are planes flying, making turns at the border."
But we are from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded onto a bus and taken to the "Chonki" sanatorium near Gomel.
His manager, Vasyl Stepanovych Venger, came and said: "Here, I am a hohol, from Chernihiv."
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko won't stop until they get rid of these thieves of yours.
The poor people are suffering!
And we have such a good Lukashenko!
"He will do as he says."
They offered to give an interview to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "You are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN representative office (at least they called themselves that) spread misinformation that men could not travel to Poland.
Many believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we still decided to leave, although we had a problem with documents - my daughter did not have a foreign passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, but the war started on Thursday.
At the Ukrainian consulate, they didn't help us at all, and in Minsk at the train station they said that no one will be allowed on the bus without passports.
Here I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were settled in Minsk and accompanied.
They couldn't hold on in the sanatorium.
Our migration representative told our second group that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half because Belarus is not Europe and there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
While passing by Mozirya (approximately 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw launches of ballistic missiles towards Ukraine: the missile takes off, shines beautifully, and then fades away.
People who got on the bus in Mozyr were saying that Russians constantly shoot from firing ranges there.
But I can say that Belarusians absolutely don't want to fight.
Generals are being discharged from the army.
One woman told us that something will happen to her son if he is called up.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is located, simply does not believe.
They say: "You're lying, we are a peaceful people."
They don't accept that their training grounds are used for attacks on Ukraine.
We waited for friends in Poland who drove us to Estonia.
Now we are going through registration and deciding what we will do next.
"In Estonia, there are probably as many Ukrainian flags as Estonian ones now."
Marina lived on the territory of a military town in Hostomel together with her brother's family - his wife and two children, aged 18 and 22.
On the morning of February 24th, she called her nephews and asked them to gather the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening, they went to spend the night in the basement of a neighboring house.
Marina herself couldn't return home and in principle she won't be able to - there's no house left.
No one really knew anything about the evacuation.
And on Monday, can't you meet somewhere in the center?
Thank you, we have everything. And we always welcome you as our guests!
Thank you for the arrangement, the butterflies are beautiful.
And in this small apartment there is no WiFi reception, mostly I am the one answering all your questions, but now I don't know what to do? And the children have online classes starting on Monday, but there is no internet.
So, will I be living with two women from Ukraine and their children? Is this a family that is ready to accept us?
In the Quran it is written: "Not a leaf falls but that He knows it."
Our children study online. I am a salesperson and a cook by profession, but I can also work in the field and as a cleaner, that is, I am a versatile worker. Mariana is a specialist in eyelash extensions and can work from home, while the other Mariana has no specific profession and is also a versatile worker.
Is it possible to agree on how to do it better?
On April 1st, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoly Fedoruk, announced joyful news that Ukrainian military forces liberated the city from Russian aggressors on March 31st.
The next day, the occupiers were expelled from the entire Kiev region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should have felt at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, as it became known that in just one location in Bucha, Russians had shot and killed at least 280 peaceful residents.
They were being killed right on the street, some had their hands tied and were shot in the back of the head, some of the victims were minors.
The beaten and tortured bodies of the village elder of Motyzhyn, Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor, and their son Oleksandr, who were abducted on March 23, were found.
The bodies of Olga and Oleksandr were buried in a common grave, and Igor's was in the sewer.
Bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket were found about 20 km off the road from Kyiv.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, there will be no one at home.
I have ordered a package from Germany using DHL.
Yesterday, they were supposed to deliver it to me, but no one contacted me and the package was not delivered, and on the DHL website it says that the recipient could not be found.
That is why the package was sent to the post office and the address of that branch was indicated.
How can I take her?
When I was little, I also used to be able to go to the river several times a day. The river was right next to the house, very close. But now I rarely go there. I don't have time, and sometimes I don't have the desire. I only go with my sister. üôÇ

Well, so that there is work and at least a store.
Good afternoon, I have just been offered a job as a dentist in Prague, so thank you very much for your concern and I apologize.
She is very careless and somewhat irresponsible.
"She may miss her stop, forget her phone, or perhaps she is not answering her phone right now and hasn't messaged me that she is at school and everything is okay :)"
I'm worried about her because she is not at home, but in another, still unfamiliar state.
I hope that I have correctly found mathematics.
You didn't think that I'm still a child.
And, of course, work also interests me.
However, if I am not very physically fit because I do not have such a good physical shape.
I could pay for accommodation at moderate prices if someone provided me with a room.
You talk a lot, maybe you will meet someone.
Good day, I am very interested in this job, but we do not speak Czech language.
At what time can we give clothes for washing?
The charitable organization Archeparchial Caritas Olomouc wants to organize a project that will be interesting for Ukrainians who are in the Czech Republic, specifically in the city of Olomouc.
Imagine, Russian men are raping women, their children are forced to watch it.
Then they might rape, mutilate the body, and the children witness all of it.
Good day, I am thinking to myself - I need to learn Czech language, but I can't pull myself away from the news.
I communicate with you in my thoughts very often. It seems to me that you can hear my thoughts.
President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that certain types of weaponry provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, writes "European Truth."
"All equipment, everything they have already sent, for some types of equipment it was done too late."
Because when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100% support, this is really true.
"And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," - said Zelensky.
On the question of whether Ukraine has received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president answered: "Not yet, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, there would have been no such war or it would have looked different.
"She would have unfolded differently, we would have had the shoulder of close neighbors, we could have fought together."
"But I'm certain that there wouldn't have been a war after all," he added.
Let us remind you that the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
"I have a dream that the war is over and to return home."
Please write to me about everything you need.
I wanted to ask you if you know where the blender on our kitchen came from.
Destructive actions in the form of spreading fakes and disinformation are aimed at provoking panic moods and disorganization, which are sensitive to public safety.
I am from Ukraine and I am currently in Pilsen.
Before the war in Ukraine, I worked as a designer of women's and children's clothing made from various materials. I can also sew using specialized equipment and make alterations.

We went to this address to ask for something related to school, some notebooks were needed. Maybe we didn't end up in the right place.
And a mother's prayer is the strongest.
I hear a lot - the war is on 10% of Ukraine's territory.
Why do people flee?
Why don't people live in areas where there is no war?
Are you in your right mind ??
Did you live in a warring country?
When prices rose by 100-200%.
When the majority of enterprises do not work.
When there is nowhere to earn money.
When do children hear the sound of anti-aircraft guns?
Did you live like this?
You have no idea.
And may God bless that they don't have.
If you find out too - it will be AWFUL.
That's why we are running away.
Some of us are lost with our phones... which were left from our previous life... and so, some have not adapted in a month.

You come to the town hall and when you arrive at the reception area, you ask for Mrs. Krzhkovska and request directions and the door number to her office.
It will be written on his door, there is a department head.
If you cannot come to an agreement, call Dominique, but I believe everything will go smoothly.
If Mrs. Krzhkovska hasn't arrived yet, please wait for her for a minute. She said she has a meeting before this and might be delayed, but she knows about you and scheduled you for 9:00 specifically so you could make it to the doctor's appointment.
Yes, of course, it would be very nice to spend time together.

An unexpected meeting at the beginning of the hostilities with Polish brothers in arms turned into a good friendship.
It is very cool and pleasant to find like-minded people where you did not expect or search for them.
The bank will apply for a loan on Monday.
By the way, about returning.

I will always be happy to make new acquaintances)
Because I'm actually always unsure of my abilities, and I need such words!
We were already home by 3:00 PM. We went with Kristina and her family to the Vyshhorod castle.

Went to the store with my mother and sister.
We arrived, prepared food, and talked.
I went out to the yard to breathe fresh air and did a little cleaning in the yard, because staying inside the house all the time can be ü§™.
If I had known, I would have gone with you.
On the map, I saw that they are only 3 kilometers away.
I would even go on foot if I had to, instead of traveling from Brno)))) I am looking for a convenient route.
That will be good. Thank you. If the ultrasound shows something, then we'll see.
We will gladly visit you!
4. Besides attending school, what other types of activities would help your child adapt to the Czech environment? (leisure and education)

Thank you very much. So, today I will order for the whole week. When ordering, do I need to write the child's last name or not?
Do you have any that will do?
Until the age of 21, I studied at the Law Academy in Kharkiv and then went to work in the prosecution office.
My brother is supposed to come to help me with the children so that I can go to work.
It was warm during the day, but in the evening a cold wind blew.
Why are you young and probably have many girls?
Everything has its pluses and minuses.
I have always wanted to visit Prague.
Hryshko has already started going to daycare, but not everything is so simple... He cries very hard.
Today a new girl from Ukraine appeared in the garden.
I didn't even touch the door, but it's ringing.
If I understood the director correctly, he said that if I work in the garden, I can come to work on certain days for as many hours as I am able to.
If that's the case, then I would be able to, for example, work a few days a week for a few hours at a time.
For how many hours and on which days will I be watching how it's going for me to be fashionable and capable of doing house cleaning? They pay more for cleaning, so I don't want to refuse that job.
I am a water supply technician, so I can immediately feel the taste of water.

There are currently 3 of us (me and children aged 3 and 17), maybe later my husband will move in with us, as he is currently staying in a dormitory.
How long do the courses last and what level of language can be expected upon completion?
Great, so I am free on Monday.
And that would be very good for me.
I will prepare all the materials.
I have a great book where the Czech language is taught step by step.
The only thing I would very much ask for is if it would be possible to have it from 1:00 to 2:00 p.m. As I work until 12:30.
To have enough time to get to that place. Will it be okay?
None that comes after the war. None that you did not think of.
Answer me directly.
Do you want to be with me?
What do you feel about me?
What can I do to convince you?
You can visit there every weekend and not get bored.
Please tell me how to get to the store?
So in the Czech Republic, people are very nice. I came on vacation to visit my children who are 10 and 15 years old, and my grandmother (who is in Marianske Lazne).
These women are not understood.
We offer free accommodation.
We live in a village in a large family house with a big garden and a closed courtyard between Yihlavou and Havlychkiv Brod.
We have 2 small children.
We will provide a room.
The kitchen, bathroom and other rooms are shared.
But first, a month of learning that will begin on April 13th.
On the website, in the photo, there is a TV. Please ask whether it is possible to come today.
He says he is comfortable on the couch, don't worry.
If anything happens, then we will come up with something.
Thank you very much for your care.
We can meet often.
My husband can bring it to your home tomorrow or on Saturday if it suits you.
No, I didn't call, the guys passed the message along. I know for sure that God is with him.
Ok, then we can go to the playground near the river.
Everything has its time. If you don't have your family now, it means that it's not time yet. When you have it, it will be 10 times bigger and closer than it could have been.
I won't be able to download, I have an old phone. I don't speak German ((
I believe that they are looking for a confectioner who speaks English.
But in order for this document to print out as I made it, it needs to be first downloaded onto the computer.
It should look like this.
Give us a vacuum cleaner for tomorrow so that we can tidy up.
And then you need to ask...it also depends on the weight and size...
Thank you, something similar we already learned.
Everything is good, we went for a walk, I am very tired.
So if no one can come, there won't be any trouble?
I sent the documents to the email address.
Only in what status did we spend this time together....
There are self-reproaches, and there are many of them...And I cannot hold back...
Can you prepare documents for us - employment contract.
This robot is big, yellow, and strong. It is 32 years old.
Sent a second message to my mom.
Thank you, I need to do some things but I can no longer go anywhere.. I need to cook and learn words.. Can we do it tomorrow at half past 10.. We are registered for the courses at 11 o'clock.
Marina, but really, if you need help with the city, my husband and I will help.
My friend and I baked yesterday, try it if you want.
Everyone was sick and had symptoms, but we didn't go to the hospital.
Just now some woman from DameEdlo called me and said that they sent me information about further actions to my email, and I didn't give a response.
She spoke Czech and I understood her.
But I don't have an email from damyeidlo.
I need small pliers to tighten the gap on the plate.
Type or types of economic activity.
We are looking for a homemaker to do regular housekeeping here, in the village.
Offer of 150 crowns/hour.
Another cooperation according to satisfaction.
You will coordinate the date with the lady yourself.
Of course, but I'm interrupting you.
There are many nuances in men too.
He was a very wealthy person, but he liked me because I had my own point of view on life. I met with him, then left him.
He was a very wealthy person. After some time, he called and reported that he had undergone heart surgery.
Asking me to simply talk to him and support him made me feel sorry for him.
He was a very wealthy person and believed that he could play with me like a toy and that I needed his money.
And then he made me a proposal.
"There was a car in my yard, resembling a crocodile, and it spat out hail."
And they kept me in the house, then led me to the basement, and there were a lot of people there, about 400, there was no air to breathe.
And what about the housing that you sent a photo of?
I haven't really reached there yet.
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already debunked this fake.
I will watch the last two videos when the internet works properly.
Is there a dress code at work or not, can you wear what you have?
Okay, he will go there and pick them up.
I am not greedy for everything.
I understand that I cannot sit with you, I need to work.
I understand. Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 and Ukrainian television at all.
I see all the news on the Internet.
1+1 is a pro-presidential, propagandist channel, not interesting to me at all.
What happened at the bus stop with the man that the police and ambulance arrived? Is he okay?
Diana did not respond to me and you
Okay, I just need to print some coloring pages for the children. So that's fine. When can I come?
But maybe you need a more detailed knowledge of the Czech language.
I'm concerned that you're satisfied with my work.
In this case, I know a girl who is Ukrainian but studies tourism in the Czech Republic.
You really don't want to come for a moment with the children calmly and with grandma.
I want you to be with me. Waking up next to you.
Overall, living in a foreign country is really difficult, every day you want to go back home more and more.
Miss Agatha, if you need this photo, then I will take a picture of myself.
Thank you for trying to make our life here as comfortable as possible.
I will remember you for the rest of my life.
And I will remember and smile ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you very much, Anna, for mapping the route in the phone's geolocation so that we could reach our destination quicker.
I need to pay the tariff, I must keep control.
How can I see how much I have used?
And how do I pay?
"I tell her that the "TV and radio repair" was delayed due to imported parts, and her friends and acquaintances are warned not to say anything extra when they call."
"We hide information about the war from our mother-in-law for a whole month."
So far, it's working out.
However, in Pliamka (the cat - UP), the fur on the belly and hind legs has come off. This may be due to stress, a change in diet, and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but unfortunately, the stress does not depend on me.
"Plyamka, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, and can hear sirens and explosions."
Thanks to the fact that Olga has poor hearing and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived incognito in the apartment with her for a month.
On April 1st, 93-year-old Oksana Poliova held a weapon for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days, I lived with her in the apartment like a partisan."
They hid the war from her and the fact that I was around - I formally came for a few hours as usual.
"But when her friend spoke up, I gave her the receiver - she listened for 4 hours, and then sang for 2 hours."
The radio receiver was always by the bed.
Most of the time the mother-in-law spends in her own room.
"Heard poorly - this allowed me to be unnoticed by her."
If I heard the sound of her "footsteps", I would hide in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and television from her.
Then she called everyone she communicates with. It's 6-7 people.
She asked to talk to her about anything, just not about the war.
I will ask my friend, she was there from the very beginning until the end.
April 17th is the day when I clean 2 apartments :)
Good evening, I didn't really think about it :)
Hello, if our help is needed tomorrow, we'll be able to come.
Is it necessary to order lunch, or can we take it home? Do I need to print out these documents, or can I print and sign them on site?
I offer men's, women's, and children's haircuts with home visits. I invite all interested parties to message me privately for pricing.
I understand you and I'm not complaining, but for now I will keep looking here in my situation.
I'm telling you that there is only an embassy here.
A British citizen who was defending Mariupol in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces says they are ready to surrender to the Russians.
A British military serviceman from the Ukrainian Navy's Marine Brigade, which is participating in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they will surrender their weapons and give themselves over to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of Aidin Ayslin, a British serviceman who served in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine since 2018, BBC citing his relatives and friends, Atlas News citing the words of Ayslin's friend who spoke with him.
Literal translation of the tweet from Aislin: "We received a message from him: "It's been 48 days, we've tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian forces.
We have not run out of food and ammunition.
"Thank you all, I hope that the war will end soon."
Details: Eyslin served in the 36th separate marine infantry brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is participating in the defense operation of Mariupol.
BBC journalists have contacted the mother of En Wood, a serviceman, and she confirmed that her son had informed her over the phone that they plan to surrender in captivity.
Brennan Philips' military friend also confirmed to journalists that in the last phone conversation, Aislin mentioned their unit's plans to surrender.
According to him, the brigade has run out of ammunition and food.
Journalists from Atlas News contacted his friend who said that Eyslin's unit intends to surrender to Russian units in order not to fall into the hands of the so-called "kadryvtsi" squads without weapons and ammunition.
There were also audio recordings of a phone conversation circulating on social media in which Aislin supposedly talks to her American acquaintance who is planning to travel to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Eyslin said that they had tried to escape the city in civilian clothing, but they were not successful.
Earlier, the British person said that representatives of the private military company "Wagner" threatened him on Instagram.
Eyslin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but from 2015-2017 he went to fight against terrorists in Syria in the so-called "Islamic State".
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took an oath.
Eyslina's friends and close ones called him Johnny, but in social media he is better known by his nickname Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you. But I also want to know. Are we together or not?
But it will not be easy, you will have to find it...
You offered to go with you, I agreed, if everything is good.
Thank you, not required for now, you have already done so much for us, we are very grateful to you.
If you ever don't want to write to me again, I'll wait.
Hello Natalia, please water the flowers outside near the entrance door. Thank you.
I would like to learn Czech language as well.
I would like you to take a little break and think about yourself.
Today, be sure to apply face cream.
Oh..I am very grateful to you. I didn't even expect to come across such a person as you. Wishing you good health and success!
Is little Du≈°an not ashamed anymore?
Ondrej and his father came to us.
No one else came in, even though there were many carol singers walking on the street.
We are at home today.
The children were studying, now they are playing.
I have to go to Lidl to buy groceries after lunch.
You have me.
You know that I love you.
I will do everything for you.
How do I prove this to love?
I want a chance for us to be together.
To prove everything to you.
Maybe you have had a lot of disappointments.
Let me make you happy.
Grandma won't be able to, her legs and waist hurt very badly((
And how much does it cost to rent a two-bedroom apartment in Prague?
Will all parents come?
The climate is almost the same.
The family is good, I have my mother, three brothers, and a husband.
One brother is at war in Mariupol, the other is in Zaporizhzhia and the husband was transferred from Kyiv to Kharkiv today.
They call every day and say that everything is fine, but who knows what the truth is, they won't tell it anyway.
I wanted to visit you, but I needed to take care of some things first. When...
I will ask the man in the morning if he can make it tomorrow.
When you come home, please write to me, I needed to talk to Daniel.
The Bolshevik attackers took full revenge for their losses in battle.
Teacher Dmytro Pavlytskyi, his unidentified relative, and young man Boris Oleksiyenko were executed by firing squad.
"Their bodies were thrown into a 'deep garbage pit, which was covered with earth'."
According to the memories, "there was a dead silence in the city."
Rarely did anyone among the residents run from house to house at a fast pace.
On the streets, bodies tortured by Bolsheviks were constantly encountered.
And maybe I will really go after you. You are needed by me. I can't be without you.
3. What personal activity of yours would help you or your friends adapt better to life in the Czech Republic?
But you won't get there because there is railway reconstruction going on and entry is closed.
Once you reach the bridge where the reconstruction is taking place, let me know that you've arrived and I'll come to you.
We have the best future ahead of us.
Lena wants to know if she should give the items that don't fit us to you or give them to Katya.
Yes, I have stopped waking up in the middle of the night.
I simply wake up very early in the morning without an alarm clock.
I sleep for 4-5 hours for now, but I am already asleep.
Marina could not wake me up today when they arrived)) But it takes time, it has to pass.
If I understood correctly, we will receive a letter from school with login details to access the menu.
We will try to pick up something from the social services office on Tuesday.
Then, when the filling cools down and the dough rises, we shape the pies and fry them on low heat in oil.
Okay, I will definitely ask him.
As soon as we settle down tomorrow evening, I will call him on Tuesday.
I want to be able to thank everyone who helped us, because it was our last hope, truthfully.
I am not afraid of work, as I also lived in a village, so I can and love to work physically.
When can I bring your things?
"Very interesting tradition you have, we do it on Christmas."
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted the draft law 7176, which is titled "On the monitoring of potential threats to national security of Ukraine in the field of economy."
It is strange that essentially the only potential threat to national security of Ukraine in the economic sphere is... the individuals who hold meetings as members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state banks.
The initiators of the draft law believe that the decisions made by the supervisory board of the state-owned company in hypothetical Kyiv can somehow solve the national security problems of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but so far there is no information about any company that has needed to physically conduct a supervisory board meeting at its location.
The potential threat from such a law is clear - it provides a great basis for "destroying" all the achievements in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual control.
That which was before the year 2015.
Why do state-owned companies need supervisory boards and who should be included in them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill "flies off" under patriotic slogans, then others may fly off tomorrow - for example, the ProZorro public procurement system or the independence of the National Bank of Ukraine.
Many things can be attributed to the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the start of the war and the bill 7176.
So on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of the bill 5397.
Overall, the desire to disband the supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some elected officials for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to demonstrate the possible consequences of the draft law, let us analyze the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals on how to address the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during war.
The first deputy minister of economy, Denis Kudin, explained the necessity of this innovation due to the risks of losing internet and other means of communication, which would make remote work of supervisory boards impossible.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make necessary decisions, which could result in the paralysis of the company's operations.
We agree that there is such a risk, but can the relocation of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine prevent it?
Let‚Äôs imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) prioritize their personal safety over the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they can be fired.
And further, most likely, this will lead to the loss of a quorum necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
However, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, as the law requires the need for a competitive selection process, which usually takes 3-4 months.
Therefore, the proposed decision by the draft law 7176 will most likely not be able to prevent the board from losing the ability to make decisions, but rather will lead to that outcome!
People's deputy and author of the draft law, Dmytro Natalukha, provides additional arguments to support it.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, especially in the defense industry complex (DIC), now require relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person, for example, from Vienna can discuss addresses and other sensitive information via Zoom."
To begin with, in Ukraine there are almost no state-owned companies in the military-industrial complex that have supervisory boards.
The supervisory board exists only in "Ukroboronprom", which essentially manages almost all state-owned enterprises in the defense industry.
But even in "Ukroboronprom", according to the legislation, the supervisory board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform their duties on a non-gratuitous basis.
"All power in Ukroboronprom belongs to the general director, who by the way will make decisions regarding the need to relocate a particular enterprise of the defense industry, which is part of the concern."
Moreover, this argument does not withstand criticism also because the bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises in the defense industry.
Mr. Dmytro also cites arguments on his Facebook page that can be classified as "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of the work of state-owned companies and state banks, but let's try to consider some of them: "respected foreign experts, at the first mention of "war", still in 2021 leave Ukraine, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in Ukrainian state-owned enterprises with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself is really suffering from the war".
Firstly, this is manipulation - the majority of such board members had never lived in Ukraine and only occasionally came here.
To say that they are "leaving Ukraine", to put it mildly, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool is widely used in global practice, in completely different spheres: business, education, medicine, etc.
It is also worth noting that membership on the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other occupations and electronic means of communication help them with this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively against foreigners.
It's interesting why Mr. Dmytro doesn't express identical claims towards the members of supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
Because they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is just a new convenient opportunity.
Greetings. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary shelter with a family. I have 2 children with me.

Yes, I understand what needs to be done.
Also, I would be grateful if you could guide me at the beginning so that I do everything the way you need it. üòä
We usually require the passport of one of the adults.
In the Brovary, Vyshhorod, and Bucha districts of the Kiev region, which were liberated from occupiers, a strengthened curfew will be introduced for 2 days.
Pavlyuk's direct speech: "In the settlements of Brovarskyi, Vyshhorodskyi, and Buchanskyi districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been strengthened!"
"Restrictions will be in place in these cities and villages from 21:00 on April 2 until 06:00 on April 5."
Details: According to the head of the regional administration, it is strictly prohibited to be on the streets of settlements and other public places, to travel by transport and on foot at this time.
Residents can only go outside when the alarm sounds to move to a shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to eliminate the consequences of Russian aggression - to clear and demine the territory.
Omelianyuk called on people who left these areas to refrain from returning home for now.
On the remaining territory of Kyiv region, the curfew will be in place daily from 9:00 PM until 6:00 AM.
I haven't received anything from school yet, only a receipt for payment.

When I asked Katya to call the border service, she said she couldn't.
Agreed, only after 8:00 PM, otherwise I will be busy before then.
I am grateful to God that He does not see this war.

The Serbian defense budget has been growing in a geometric progression for several years in a row.
Overall, over the past six years, Serbia has invested over two billion euros in the modernization of its army, updating military equipment and acquiring modern systems, rising 22 places in the list of the most powerful military states in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries took very seriously the prediction of a possible escalation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic resolution of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict becomes more complicated and globalized.

I probably asked the question incorrectly.
Should I take her with me or not? The nanny services are designed for much younger children.
Use of company car and reimbursement of expenses.
No, here where we were with Mr. Peter, we looked at this house during the dinner, it suits us very much and we really liked it.

The authorities of Lukashenko's regime have detained three Belarusians, aged 27 and 28, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of a signaling installation under Osipovichi that provides railway traffic.
Source: "Radio Svoboda", human rights center "Viasna", the chief of criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennadiy Kazakevich, as quoted by the state information agency "BelTA".
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, with the power support of the special forces unit "SOBR", three residents of Bobruisk were detained, and one was injured.
According to "Viasni" information, the men put up active resistance and tried to escape during the arrest.
The security forces have used weapons.
One of the detained has been injured and is in a medical facility.
Medical assistance was provided on site for others.
Head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Interior of Belarus, Hennadii Kazakevych, announced that "acts of terrorism on the railways of Belarus will be harshly suppressed" by law enforcement officers using weapons.
On April 6th, it became known that on March 30th the police had arrested another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovichi branch of "BZhD" and administrator of thematic resources "BZhD" on "VKontakte" and "Odnoklassniki", Valentyn Samasiuk.
"His current whereabouts and condition are unknown, reports @belzhd_live."
At the end of March, in Belarus, at least 40 railway workers were detained for sabotage.
Reminder: The formation of BYpol, declared extremist by the Lukashenko regime, continues to encourage Belarusians to carry out sabotage on railway transport and infrastructure objects within Belarus as part of the "Victory" plan.
Belarusian "railway guerrillas" are trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine in this way.
As it is known, Russia is transferring live forces and equipment through Belarus to wage war in Ukraine.
This is for boosting self-esteem.
Do you like to read books?
And in phone mode, they also don't work on Easter holidays?
Can this be done over the phone any day or not?
Even a separate law was passed on this issue.
We were driving here for 4 days, so it was just a horror rather than a road.
They were driving through the Kyiv oblast, to the city of Irpin, and there was terror - shooting and sirens.
I'm worried about them.
Sylvia, have the funds from Kletskani not yet arrived to Masha? Can we give them a call?
Yes, I'll tell them, I think they will be at home.
There are different Muslims. There are fanatics, and there are truly believers.
The meaning of jihad is interpreted differently by different Muslims.
But to be honest, I feel very uncomfortable doing this for money.
You have done me a lot of good.
I can do it for free.
Temporarily, while we are looking for a university, eventually, permanent residency will be required.
But maybe she will have a dormitory. (we are searching in Prague, Brno, and other places)
We are not far from Prague now, we have a car and we are ready to partially pay for accommodation.
The city or village does not matter, it is desirable that it be a separate dwelling.
I accidentally subscribed to two unnecessary Vodafone promotions and they charged me for them, but I can't unsubscribe from them üò≠.
And they took money from a card where there wasn't any.
And I don't understand what the money was taken for.
The cost of repairs is paid by the owner, Mr. Dedina. He is supposed to appear on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, stay at home and wait for the repairmen.
Can I ask you for a cigarette?
Can we change the mobile tariff if you have time? Or is it already too late?
The USA bans investments in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters.
The United States, along with G7 and EU, is imposing new sanctions against the daughters of President Putin of Russia, the largest banks in Russia - Alfa Bank and Sberbank, and also prohibiting all new investments in Russia.
This is mentioned in a statement on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, while Alpha Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the US financial system and prohibit US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will impose a complete ban on new investments in Russia.
For this purpose, US President Joe Biden will sign a new executive order that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the decision of over 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia."
The private sector includes producers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as law firms and consulting firms," says the White House statement.
The third step of the new US sanctions became restrictions against major Russian state-owned enterprises in critical sectors.
This will prohibit US citizens from conducting operations with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the states.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list on the next day, which is Thursday.
And the final part of the package is the complete blocking of assets of adult children of Putin, wife and daughter of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Lavrov, as well as members of the Security Council of Russia, including former President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions disconnect them from the US financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.
You can only get to this place, further passage is closed and I will come to you.
Vera, can we already wash the dishes in the machine?
My name is Olga. Before the war, I worked as a flight attendant for SkyUp airline. My mother is a seamstress for industrial products, and my little son Makarchik goes to daycare.
We lived beautifully, but we never even thought that we would have to run away because we no longer have the strength to hide in the basement.
I was lucky and found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
Therefore, we hope that someone will shelter us at first. We can even pay for a room or an apartment, but only if it fits our budget.
We guarantee cleanliness and order.
We don't have any bad habits.
We will be grateful for such help in such a difficult time for us.
After lunch, I had one English lecture and then went to work in the kids' room.
I explained to Margarita how to fill out all the documents there.
I hope she understood everything and will do everything well.
Also, I met Mrs. Lena and talked to her about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought an announcement from the swimming pool.
This is free swimming.
Can you call the school, Kira is not answering her phone and I don't know if she has made it to school.
They are isolating the Russian office: stopping investments and halting supplies.
However, we did not come to an understanding.
Soldiers didn't settle in our house.
Our house is located near the military unit and the oil base.
He simply helped me because I wouldn't have managed alone.
I cook deliciously, don't ask unnecessary questions and give good advice.
I manage myself.
It's a little hard for me, but I understand that I have to go through this stage.
We will meet on Thursday and I will tell you everything.
Overall everything is fine.
I'm sorry, but the given Ukrainian sentence is incomplete/incorrect. It could mean "I'm walking, how often do you clean?" but it's unclear without additional context. Please provide more information or a corrected sentence for accurate translation.
I clean every week.
Unfortunately, I don't have the program, but I will try to figure it out.
I dreamed of becoming a teacher.
My girls cannot move anywhere right now, so I haven't written to the house owner.
I wanted to ask you that if you hear any information about housing, please let me know.
I would gladly rent accommodation with some decent girl.
If you can know such a thing, let me know.
I won't let you down from my end.
Thank you in advance.
Another person, Natalia, 54 years old, hasn't written to you yet. Please write the exact address and how much the courses cost.
I think it's better for you to make copies of our passports, they contain all the information.
I did not change my last name, I have had the same one since birth :)
Good day Mr. Reirarde! Sorry, I didn't see your message. I will do it now and send it to you right away.
We are going for a medical examination now.
So you need to work this hour on another day.
On which day would it be better for her to come earlier? (Maybe on a day with a little more work?)
Tomorrow I will finish listening, the Internet is working poorly. Good night.
What are you going to do now?
Thank you.. We found some things, but nothing was found from the equipment...
Both beginners, we know nothing except the alphabet.
Nothing is happening.
Can we meet on Monday, April 25th?
Children can be taken with you, there are enough toys here :)
Guessed about dad.
Perhaps, I am very naive or very in love, but I will come up with something with this money.
We will somehow do it.
But how will this be paid for, please, no loans.
Write to me directly and I will help.
We are your partner, or I am not your partner.
I don't even know anymore.
Do we need to take the clothing they gave us with us?
Today is not my day. The blinds in the living room broke. One in the morning and another one now in the evening.
I received something from you, but I don't see what it is.
I am also very sad.
I will remind you about the texture later.
Do only your dad speak and understand Russian?
On which day does the colleague want to do the house cleaning and how many windows does the house have?
I am sorry for distracting you from your affairs.
Good evening, I can't help but share with you. There is news from Mariupol about my son - he is alive and serving.
I recommend reading Joe Dispenza, he conducts scientific research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neural connections.
Journalist of TV channel "1+1" Natalia Nahorna published a video she received on the morning of April 12 from military personnel of the 36th Marine Infantry Brigade from Mariupol.
The military in it say that they don't have any weapons left to participate in battles, and there are a lot of wounded.
They said that "the clock is ticking."
Earlier, on April 11th, the 36th separate marine brigade, which is involved in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement mentioned that April 11th could become the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
On social networks, skepticism was expressed that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valery Zaluzhny, assured that there is communication between the command and the defense forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defense operation should not be a subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian soldiers at the Azovstal factory in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
In the evening of April 11th, Russian occupants dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of "Azov" Andriy Biletsky, the Russian army has used chemical weapons on the Azovstal plant, which is held by soldiers of the Azov regiment.
Thank you, I will adjust to your wishes. That would be very good.
The situation is still the same, we remain here for now.
2 hours of driving)) walking around, mom shopping and back)!
That's not an important matter.
She forgot what to do here.
From today, a squadron of Czech üá®üáø drones began flights over Ukraine üá∫üá¶.
Nearly 50 professional drones üöÅ will serve to detect, and some of them - for direct destruction of the enemy aggressor üí•.
Two brothers from Transcarpathia and two brothers from the Czech Republic, known as "birds", were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Council, Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today, their friends from the mountains, led by the head of the village council and the coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur, delivered the drones as intended: specialized units of the Ukrainian army in different cities where the fighting is currently taking place received them.
In order to maximize the efficient and safe use of drones - their locations will remain secret for now.
Four friends who are helping the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop. They say that in the coming days, they will send many interesting "gifts" to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
Don't worry, everything is fine. I love sweets, but I can do without them.
I'm worried we won't make it. Lots of luggage.
I am coming back to Ukraine soon to continue working.
Good. If everything is okay, I'll agree.
I will try myself, but if there are any problems I will write to you, if that's okay?
The most important thing is to understand each other.
We personally visited the head of the village in Yivov and she saw me and that I was pregnant, but she said that there was no housing available.
Maybe she will be happy and her mood will lift.
My phone was repaired today.
And I think that today I also froze outside.
I took medicine and tea, feel worse but not critically.
I am also sorry, but it's better to meet when I am healthy.
When you have time, send me the music you like.
I'm curious, what kind of musical preferences do you have? üòä
You should listen to mother and father.
You will find it somewhere near your little brother's stroller.
Today it was cooler and rainy here. It should be warmer tomorrow.
But it is not a pity for destroyed buildings, it is a pity for people who are being tormented by occupiers.
In Kherson, the occupiers mocked the "Glory to Ukraine" memorial on Perecop Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore down the flag of the European Union, smashed panels with photographs of the Heavenly Hundred and those who died in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
Occupiers have torn down portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and fallen participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They took down the flag.
Good morning, thanks to the children for caroling. We don't have such a tradition, so we didn't know what to give them, we only gave them chocolate and cookies. Maybe we should have given them something else too.
In Czech, there's someone to talk to, just in case.
Because I live in a dormitory, there will be people here until twelve o'clock, and then they go to work.
Hello, feeling a bit better now.
"I have already been to the daycare center today."
Even today, he has already slept there.
Therefore, we have already made significant progress.
I will definitely bring some dumplings next time!
Today, I don't have the strength to do them.
Since I am repulsed by the days and times when there is work to clean apartments after guests, I can approximately say it is for the month of April as I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments.
For the month of May - I will be able to approximately say at the end of April or the beginning of May.
Just asked if you have anything to say about it.
Hello, sorry for not responding for a long time, I was cooking dinner and took a little nap.
If you don't mind, could I come today?
Or we'll meet after your arrival.
"He is modest, and has been studying a lot lately. He understands that it is very necessary for him in life."
Hello) everything went very well.
I was a little shocked that I work with people in such a high position.
Today I had a lesson with a lady who is the director of the economics department of the highland region.
She was very satisfied with my work.
Grishko behaved well in the nursery.
On Monday, I need to bring documentation confirming my employment as well as cash payment for the daycare.
I'm lazy on Fridays.
I'm not doing anything, just eating a lot and sleeping üòÇ (and drinking a lot of water ‚òùüèª)
If I am going to the doctor tomorrow, can I ride with you?
I need to bring another analysis.
So there will be no need to go again.
The drain tank is working very poorly, it flushes poorly. A repairman is needed. It needs to be fixed.
So everything is there/available.
Can you send me the correct email address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course that you have registered for.
And are children fed there or do we need to bring our own food?
And now, may I ask you one question?
If you need any more help, write.
If I'm not mistaken, you celebrate Easter today, right?
From the very beginning, we didn't really want you to collect funds so that people wouldn't think that we are speculating on this!
But for online filling out, two points were not enough for me:
"I will go to bed to rest. To gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Good night."
üòÑüòçWhat a wonderful idea. I will watch the video now. It will be great because the whole family will be drawing.
Kharkiv University calls on employees and students to carefully verify any information, not to trust anonymous sources on messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Rely only on official information.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother who stayed in Ukraine also helps the army.
I gathered a few works for my portfolio.
After the holidays, they are supposed to install Internet.
I would like to be your backup designer.
How will they count the day that I was away from work if I have a pass?
Staff summary: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine.
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state."
Literally: "The possibility of the Russian Armed Forces conducting provocative actions in the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova with the aim of accusing Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state cannot be ruled out."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive military grouping for actions on the Sloboda direction.
Probably, in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
Moreover, the enemy continues to prepare and send personnel, weaponry, and equipment to participate in combat actions on the territory of Ukraine.
Preparation of weapons and military equipment is being carried out at the permanent location of the 60th separate motorized infantry brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th general military army of the Eastern military district.
Likely, the mentioned weaponry will be relocated to the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region.
Also, to replenish the personnel losses of the subunits of the battalion tactical group from the composition of the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzia, Zabaikalskyi Krai), recruitment of servicemen from the specified brigade is carried out by the 29th combined-arms army of the Eastern Military District.
The enemy is facing a particular problem when selecting candidates for driver and mechanic-driver positions.
The departure of the selected personnel from the permanent deployment point is planned for the second half of April this year.
Probably, the enemy will continue to strike objects of transport infrastructure in Ukraine in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the locations of hostilities, with the aim of destroying them or rendering them inoperative.
Designated units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to fulfill tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Homiel regions.
On the Slobozhansky direction, separate units from the composition of the 6th General Military Army and coastal forces of the Northern Fleet continue partial blocking of the city of Kharkiv, and artillery shelling of separate districts of the city continues.
Air reconnaissance of the area on the Izium direction is being carried out to detect the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this purpose, the enemy uses the UAV "Orlan-10".
Using the forces of two battalion tactical groups, the enemy attempted to launch an attack in the direction of the settlements of Dovhenke and Dmytrivka, but they were unsuccessful and had to retreat to their previously occupied positions.
On the Donetsk direction, the adversary continues to concentrate its main efforts on taking control of the towns of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nyzhne, and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing complete control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy attempted to conduct assault operations in the area of Zolote, but was not successful.
In the city of Mariupol, the occupiers continue the assault using artillery and aviation in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
With the forces of separate units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopyllya, Trudolyubivka, and Maryanske.
Defenders of Ukraine repelled four enemy attacks in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions over the past day and destroyed five tanks, eight armored vehicles, six units of motor vehicles and eight enemy artillery systems.
Did I not understand your thoughts?
We will certainly try to make it in time, but I doubt it.
And how can you want to sleep when I'm keeping you?
Are you sure you don't mind if I come?
If you simply do not feel like meeting today, just tell me, I will understand everything.
Thank you. We don't watch TV at home, especially not 1+1. There's no need for you to set it up for us :)
I turn on the TV here solely to listen to the Czech language.
My monthly plan is expiring today :)
Can we do this over the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, embroidery thread.
"I understand, so I can prepare material in this area."
I will ask her. I feel a little embarrassed to ask, she already gives us a lot of pies.
We will definitely meet up with my father later. üôèüèª
I read an announcement on Facebook, so I suppose Google wrote something of their own üèµÔ∏è. I think phone numbers are enough.
Good day, we have taken the items you brought, but there are some items that are too small for us. Could you bring them to us in 10 minutes?
I have thought about work.
If the director approves, then I can start working from next week because tomorrow before lunch I plan to go to the job center to submit documents (if it works out, because the queues are very long) and on Saturday it will rain :)
I am looking for a team to start with. I enjoyed chemistry in school and I am studying Czech language to be proficient. My dream is to work at Teva.
Friends old and not so old, friends whom I have not personally met, friends in spirit and mind.
Now difficult times have also come to you.
During the last month, I have communicated with many of you.
Your life, which was never easy to begin with, has been turned upside down, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing from Russia.
And many of you have confessed that you feel guilt and shame for your country's actions towards your neighbors.
Because of what they subject Ukraine to on your behalf.
For some of you activists, the threat has been hanging over for a long time, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Oleksandr Cherkasov, my very old friend from "Memorial".
"I'll tell you a bit later," Sasha answered succinctly as usual. "Right now we're walking through the ruins after the search."
Others, such as cultural figures, artists, critics, and writers, are impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: except for a very few of you - those who worked at "Memorial", "Novaya Gazeta", "Echo of Moscow", "Meduza", Navalny's organization, and a few other places - how many of you did anything to resist this regime?
Except for possibly participating in protests, when they were still happening.
Also read the column of the Russian journalist "Late to hide, late to be silent".
And if that is the case, are you sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just abstractions?
Perhaps they are caused by your long-standing indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which now, probably, have weighed heavily on your soul and heart?
It wasn't always like this.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you to some extent possessed freedom and democracy - even chaotic and bloody, but real.
But 1991 turned out to be no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time a revolution finally happens to you, you are eventually gripped by such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the back of the king, be it Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still feel safer around him. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and publishing the archives of the KGB, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you devoted your soul to the monument of Dzerzhinsky - and allowed the KGB to lie at the bottom, renew, reform, and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between the plunder of the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option - and meekly accepted the plunder.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, which marked the end of mass protests for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
Survival became the main concern.
Then came Putin. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with the terrorists and revitalize the economy.
Not many of you bought into it, but still either voted for it or chose not to vote at all.
When he started comparing Chechnya to the ground again, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember those years well.
At that time, I was working in Chechnya, helping victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Katar-Yurt, Itum-Kali, and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends, I would return to Moscow and have fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors that I had witnessed: about the torture of civilians, the murdered children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the deceased to their families.
You told me: "Breda, we're tired of your Chechnya already." I remember these words very well.
In response, I was outraged: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya."
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a foolish foreigner here.
"It is your government's authority to bomb one of your cities and kill your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic boom in the mid-2000s, caused by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to turn a blind eye to the fact that some of the stolen money would remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have started to earn well, some became rich, and even the poorest of you have purchased new housing and found a better job.
Prices went up, but is that really a problem?
Moscow was shining and glittering with luxury.
When several opposition figures were killed - Yuriy Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others - many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.
However, the matter did not progress further.
When after two terms Putin transferred the post of president to Medvedev and took the position of prime minister himself, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When after several months of Medvedev's rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored or remained silent about it.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbek, or in cafes and Turkish baths in Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we probably didn't do much in the West, if we did anything at all.
A little bit of outrage, a little bit of sanctions; but what significance does it have that Russia flagrantly violates international law, when there is such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas, and domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, this was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, finally woke up.
When Putin again swapped places with Medvedev and took the presidential seat as before, many of you decided that enough was enough and took to the streets to protest.
Navalny's name became a nickname, you didn't leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he struck back in response.
At first, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands ended up behind bars.
Some people have received huge terms.
"And what could we do?"
I heard it so often and still hear it.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, just look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angry at the pro-Russian president who deceived their European hopes, they once captured Maidan - and never left it again.
They built a tent camp entirely on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police arrived and tried to demolish it, they began to defend themselves using sticks, reinforcement bars, and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of running away, protesters switched to attack.
Many have died, but they emerged victorious.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, while Ukrainians regained their democracy, the right to independently choose their leaders and to drive them out if they perform poorly.
Putin didn't really like the Maidan.
This was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he seized Crimea.
Some of you were against it, however there was little benefit from it.
And how many of you were impressed!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Suddenly, a new myth arose from somewhere, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly made a 180-degree turn and began to adore him.
It is difficult for me to find a reason, since we stopped communicating immediately afterwards.
The rest of those who remained my friends mostly remained silent.
"You said, "We're not interested in politics"."
And you hid in new books, movies, IKEA catalogs, and parks, all renewed after the restoration that was initiated by the Mayor of Moscow in 2012, with their running tracks, public Wi-Fi and hipster cafes.
Actually, Donbass is far away, but Moscow is so beautiful - and becoming even better.
You barely noticed Syria.
"There were terrorists there, weren't there?"
IDIL or whatever it is‚Ä¶ Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview because supposedly I didn't understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw for myself how state snipers in the streets of Homs cold-bloodedly shoot at my children's peers.
Out of all citizens of Russia, only your soldiers were there, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Undoubtedly, many of you are familiar with the words of pastor Martin Niemoller:
"First, they came for the socialists, but I remained silent because I was not a socialist."
Then they came for the members of the trade unions, but I remained silent - because I was not a member of a trade union.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent - because I was not a Jew.
"Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say anything in my defense."
How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you did this.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some people are really speaking now - such as Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov, and others.
Most people allow themselves to speak from abroad, some - from within the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking being sent to a new Gulag or joining Navalny's company.
As for others, you know best in which country you live.
Therefore, I am sure you understand: when Putin deals with Ukrainians - or, which seems very likely, if he fails, he will come after you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who bravely, but mostly on their own, went out to protests and have so far endured for a short period of time, but soon will face a more serious challenge.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, expressed disagreement on social media (even with just a black square on Instagram), or spoke up in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given just for a joke are not so far in the past - and now they are likely waiting for you in the future.
Who will then speak for you? Who will be left?
The example of Ukrainians - even more so than in 2014 - scares the Putin regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And what intelligence, motivation, and courage can stop it, no matter how overwhelming his advantage may be on paper.
Considering everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that there is a war going on in general.
But you, my friends, know well what is happening right now.
You are reading international news online, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you maintain contact.
And Putin knows that you know.
So be prepared.
You understand where everything is heading.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are just a joke, your laws, if not counting the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper they are written on, your last remaining free media is gone, your economy is collapsing faster than I can write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if some flights are still available.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your agreement, your submission.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try to negotiate or leave, or you will be crushed.
I doubt that you see any other option.
And yet there remains one more.
What will finally bring down this regime.
And perhaps, under the circumstances that have arisen, you may need less from you than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not ignite from you: due to the impending economic collapse in Russia, it is most likely to ignite in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices rise and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace, will take to the streets.
"Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, meaning you, my friends."
But if every city holds protests on its own, as has periodically happened, it will be easy for it to suppress them one by one.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be transformed into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool - the internet, which may have limitations, but is still functioning and can be adjusted almost under any circumstances.
The Navalny organization was crushed, but it is possible to create others that are more informal and decentralized.
You are very numerous, you are millions.
The Moscow police can handle up to thirty thousand people on the city streets, possibly up to one hundred thousand.
If it goes over 300,000, she will be overwhelmed.
We'll have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to it?
After everything he made them go through in Ukraine, everything he forced them to endure?
Of course, the danger will be very high.
Many of you will feel understandable fear; those who have children will be afraid for them.
And this is natural, this is normal.
If I were in your place, I would be afraid too.
By using the example of Syria and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to ignore their master, who not only demand freedom, but actually try to achieve it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will make a joke in the chat of a computer game - and will be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the internet - and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and will die in a damp cell under police batons.
Here is what has been happening for many years - and it will only continue to intensify, gaining bigger and bigger scales.
So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.
Act cool-headed, think strategically, and achieve making it a reality.
We were at a class on Friday, and they told us that we can come on Monday.
We'll be home in the evening.
What do you perceive me as a press secretary?
Viko, how often do you go to have dinner in an expensive restaurant?
Once in a while, I go to a fancy restaurant for dinner.
I will try to explain everything to her)
"We liked it so much, it was very nice, and we wanted something shiny, so this is the best option."
I was in a room with many people. I got energetically tired.
I feel bad, cough, temperature, lost my voice, weakness, and dizziness.
I have to go to that government office for work.
"We have already done this, but they said that those who registered in April will only receive the money at the end of the month."
We need a pass for Thursday, we are going with the children to the doctor.
But during the night, one lady wrote to me who liked your work and she would like something from you at her house.
I am waiting for her to share the latest news and will definitely inform you.
Working in the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, and I spent a lot of time and effort.
"I had a difficult psychological, responsible, intellectual job which I completely lost faith in."
It‚Äôs a shame to lose time, but it‚Äôs a life experience.
In my personal life, I am sociable, but I am monogamous and take marriage matters seriously.
There was a man who I was supposed to marry, but he passed away due to heart problems.
I believe that for creating a family, people should love, respect, and trust each other.
For now, I haven't met anyone like that.
Good day. Where in Yihlava can I buy molds for baking Easter bread (paper or silicone)?
Okay, thank you for the advice, I will now add Valya's certificate to the application.
She has cerebral palsy and is in a lying position, her leg is currently in a cast, the wheelchair is in a lying position, and all her food is blended.
Mr. Reichard, I'm sorry for bothering you during non-working hours.
But I have an important question for you.
I stopped by the game room today to say hello to Natalia.
She had an unpleasant situation happen to her.
Because when the children were going home, one mother refused to pick up her child saying that she came to look at things and organize them in the room with clothes, and Mr. Valeriy opened our children's room for her until 7:00 p.m. yesterday.
Can it really be so?
The working hours of the room are until 4:00 PM.
And ultimately, this is our responsibility.
But I can't load or open the page, the internet is very weak.
Good day, everything is fine with us :) Kolya is working, we filled out invitations yesterday, and I was busy with the older children before the exam at the gymnasium.
The hardest thing right now is to deal with geometry assignments.
On Saturday, Volodymyr helped us.
Vika is researching universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and utilities?
We are very grateful for the accommodation.
Yes, but I thought you didn't fill it out.
We will try our best to collect the necessary amount by the end of the week to settle the payment.
The situation regarding the Russian invasion - a briefing by the advisor to the head of the Office of the President, Oleksiy Arestovych (10.04.2022).
The advisor to the President's Office told about the heroic act of a senior officer of the border troops in Mariupol - he was surrounded and wounded, so he blew himself up with a radio station so that it would not fall into the hands of the enemy.
I have a very important question: will they help me register my granddaughter who is 5 years old (has bronchial asthma) and currently has a runny nose and wheezing?
We need a family doctor for her who will understand Ukrainian or Russian language a little bit.
Urgently need a doctor's consultation very worried about her condition.
We live in Doln√≠ Chabry, Czech Republic. We need a doctor who is located here in Doln√≠ Chabry or somewhere nearby, possibly in Brno but not far from the subway, so that we can reach them.
I really liked the butterfly exhibition.
Butterflies landed on the children's hands and legs.
How is your day?
"Wow, what a cool little garden! I am so grateful to you, words cannot express it. Vlada really liked it ‚ù§Ô∏è."
Mom has been standing there since 4 in the morning.
Maybe the hostess will leave her phone for communication.
For now, this house in Prague 8 seems like the best option to me.
The director did not mention anything to me about the possibility of sponsor payment for my child's lunches.
They gave me such data for payment.
For a portion of March and for April, I have already paid for food.
If you had the opportunity, could you help me pay for May and June?
What do I need to do?
Should I address this issue to the school principal?
"Is it better to come on Mondays or Wednesdays?"
All of your friends will know that you communicate with me.
I don't know what to do, I need a place to live soon but there is no housing available.
Did you end the relationship or were you left?

But we can do everything, we're Ukrainians after all, and whatever we can't do, we quickly learn)))

"We need to periodically go to the embassy, I am waiting for when they can process the documents, so I go and ask. I will keep searching here."
