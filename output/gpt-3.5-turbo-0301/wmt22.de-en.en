The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods...
I am #PRS_ORG# a major customer and therefore it is no problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction on what to include in the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
A few days ago, I ordered #PRS_ORG#... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
Honestly, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and place a new one for the better price or is there another option for a credit?
I generally also think that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it's good for older siblings to take care of their younger siblings in moderation.
Just take a quick look, help briefly, bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help out in the family, and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough of a child themselves, I don't see a problem there.
If your child occupies themselves alone for a short period of time and is okay with it, then that's good.
You can best assess for yourself whether it is suitable for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap and accompany K2 for hours while falling asleep.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Maybe that's where the statement from the psychologist comes from.
Because if something were to happen, like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether it is a risk you want to take or not, is of course at your discretion ;)
Please help me to find the title of a book again!
I remember having read a crime/thriller a few years ago and while I can still recall almost the entire plot, the title just won't come to me, perhaps someone here knows?
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caretaker commits suicide by pouring food over himself and entering the enclosure with his big cats.
The case is taken over by a female commissioner who, after a brief investigation, gets involved with his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides happening and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the scene of each suicide and document it, then post the photos on the internet.
In any case, it ultimately turns out that this therapist runs some sort of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain, and ultimately allows the patients to confront their fear in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of the window, another intentionally drives herself to death.)
This confronting of fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That is the rough plot, and I am pretty sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone knows about this action or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very grateful.
Oh dear, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi available.
I first need to contact my husband.
That may take a while.
What steps do I need to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to have the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail.
Child, four years old, has wood splinters under the thumbnail (outside).
Tried to pull it with a pair of tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
Did not work out and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No chance anymore.
Tomorrow, we are going to the doctor.

Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to advance booster vaccination efforts.
Always new Omicron cases worry politics and science in Great Britain.
Therefore, all qualifying adults in England are supposed to receive a vaccination offer by New Year's.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make faster progress in the COVID-19 booster vaccinations in light of rapidly rising Omicron case numbers than previously aimed for.
Every adult in England should already have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since their second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
According to Johnson, we are facing an emergency in the face of the Omicron variant, which is why the vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third vaccine dose.
"Get boosted now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 additional Omicron cases were registered in Great Britain, bringing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
"I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns."
I have sent an application.
Today, I received an invitation for a conversation by email.
I want to reply to the email.
But unfortunately the name is not "Peter," rather a slightly more complicated name.
I googled him/her and depending on where he/she comes from culturally, it is either a man or a woman.
"I have no idea how to write the email now."
Can someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and I don't want to step on any officials' toes.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one thing that I bought today doesn't work.
Apparently, the chair had an unseen defect when it was sold.
How else can such upholstery damage occur after 9 months?
Tried only on the #PRS_ORG#.
But that has been working for about.
14 days no more.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to please add 2 chairs to the order and invoice me for it.
[EN] The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I will write in some detail about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more frequently for professional reasons.
An issue that really bothers me and unfortunately happens all too often is that many victims do not seek help or think we cannot help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are few things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in private conversations, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach everyone.
"I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children out of it."
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears myself, is that everyone is worth being able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to simply accept violence.
Often I wish I could always help out... I know that I can't.
However, it will never become easier that way.
Please always remember that you are worthy of living without violence, this is incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: How good is the series for "League of Legends"?
Lots of fantasy, many complicated names, stunning visuals: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" video game universe, recently debuted on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced second season?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim.
At least on youngster Johannes Patrick, you could rely on.
Again nothing: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick said with reference to the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our bellies."
But it didn't calm down after the game - instead increased again in light of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Whereas more than just the bare result, it was the style and manner of the performance that was disappointing.
As an example, let's mention a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: the three-point percentage was only 13 percent, with 4 successful attempts (all by the young Johannes Patrick) out of an incredible 31 attempts - any further questions?
The answer came from John Patrick: "After the victory in Tenerife, we simply weren't concentrated enough and didn't implement what we trained for."
Namely, to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted completely differently: "It feels great to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time in a row," said the elated coach.
"It felt like in front of 10,000 people."
Only 750 visitors were allowed on Saturday in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they got their money's worth.
Not least due to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and directed his team's game.
"The best playmaker I have ever coached," praised Gleim.
While in Patrick's team even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a complete disaster and managed to reduce the deficit to eight points, after having been behind 39:59 already.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Thankfully, there is not a lot of time left for hesitating.
Already on Wednesday (7 PM), the Riesen are hosting the Skyliners Frankfurt, with a maximum of 750 spectators also allowed in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I already contacted/got in touch a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have consulted with our legal team again and therefore have written to you again.
We actually reached out half a year ago.
Always perfectly groomed: Max Raabe turns 59.
He is able to enthuse his audience with reinterpretations of popular songs from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good day, dear happiness" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe had wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But that won't happen.
The planned concert has been rescheduled to May 2022 - "on official instruction" to curb the coronavirus.
Other planned performances during the Advent season must also be canceled for now, as stated on the website of the singer and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de), who turns 59 today.
From January, the artists want to catch up on the dates that had been postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12th, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has already sung a lot and happily as a teenager.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing and in 1986, he founded the Palast Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hit songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded numerous prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached the second place in the charts - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013).
He made it from niche to mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with his blonde hair slicked back and attentive to etiquette, Max Raabe has become an indispensable figure in the current German-language music scene.
With the program "Good day, dear luck" he has been on tour since 2020. (This is a direct translation, but please note that the actual name of the program might be different in English.)
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be complemented with existing furniture and therefore, we could check beforehand whether it matches in color.
It still doesn't work, I can only see the cover page but cannot turn the pages.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new apartments.
The new Federal Minister of Building, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations as demanded in a popular vote in Berlin.
"With expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure is changed," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants the security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is, incidentally, the best protection against a monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party will appoint an expert commission to decide how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
If the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent cap until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tight housing markets, and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
"If the rental market does not relax despite this, we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I realized that I forgot the last step of the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available now.
Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or whether it will ever come again at all?

Voucher sounds great.
Then I will redeem it automatically with the new order.
Thank you very much for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will the shipping itself take?
I already cut myself on the finger.
That is an absolute impertinence.
At least 100 dead from tornadoes in Kentucky.
A devastating storm system has swept through the United States with numerous tornadoes.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths to mourn.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
During the night of Friday to Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the USA and possibly claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms leave a path of devastation approximately 320 kilometers long, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Whose governor Andy Beshear said after visiting the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had raged, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that it is even possible.
He alone expects up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky, and the official numbers are increasing hourly.
Hello, I just saw that the display case #NAME# is sold out.
That's very unfortunate.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been completely removed from the assortment?
Is it possible to order this display case in another country?
Until when will you let me know?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany, the one that is in the shopping cart?
I returned an article or submitted a return through the contact form and wanted to inquire whether it was received or being processed, as I have not received any confirmation yet.
Companies pay vaccination bonuses and change advertising slogans.
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees monetary incentives for getting vaccinated.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into calls for vaccination, following the German example, is also intended to increase willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.
He switched to a company about which he had gossiped.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It has been one year.
He clearly didn't get stuck in his old position and looked for something else.
You are allowed to do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, never mind.
Well, he didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please process the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I am taking a screenshot.

Assistance with first personal campaign
Greetings from Boron!
I am currently leading the adventure "Over the Gryphon Pass" for a group of 4 friends and I would like to seamlessly transition my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We are playing The Dark Eye 5 (a role-playing game).
The big arc has been created, the villains and their motivations have been written, the individual acts have been devised and now I am in the process of writing the entry adventure and already stumbling over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a wagon loaded with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Thuran Lake.
There, the further plot is supposed to develop.
A few miles away from the village, a group of goblins is supposed to ambush the heroes and lure them into a trap.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early, whatever comes to the players' minds.
Group strength: 8 regular goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers.
If not noticed, the goblins wait for the heroes in a hollow path and flank the carriage with bows, three on each side, while two armed with spears stop the carriage.
If a fight breaks out and the heroes lose, I have two possible solutions.
1. The heroes all become unconscious and are subsequently found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf.
The cart is naturally gone.
2. If defeat is inevitable, this team of eleven will engage in battle with two of its servants and come to the aid of the heroes.
The cart is still there, everything's great.
What do you think of the use of Deus ex Machina in solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an entry into the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a crucial role later, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now I have more confidence in my narrative again.
I disassembled the lamp again.
And put back together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Therefore, I would still like to send them back.
Can you then send the receipt, so that I can pack the lamp and take it to #PRS_ORG#?

suddenly the crack/tear was there

Will everything be picked up again or only the storage space part?
I am annoyed with Sky Sport F1.
Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season, the quality on German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to vent a little with this post.
First of all, in the middle of the F2 race, the broadcast was interrupted today to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although the schedule was far behind the planning due to the delayed start and the starting accident, one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
Apparently, it is the case that due to legal reasons, Formula 1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Nevertheless stupid, especially considering Sky UK has broadcasted the entire race.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes did a good job accompanying the difficult situation around the severe accident.
Then there was once again a lack of understanding of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher in F1, as both did not know that changing tires is allowed under a red flag.
Although this situation already occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen is allowed to change tires when there were corresponding radio messages on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this opportunity for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that such elementary rules should simply be known when commenting on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first guessing game of what is now possible or required according to the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties about rules.
Generally, I don't like Roos' artificial style of commenting, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But seriously, even Heiko Wasser from RTL appeals to me better.
In addition, constant foolishness comes into play, which just makes both of them seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latter one brings a lot of unrest into the comments as he apparently does not take them seriously.
Last but not least, advertising is simply getting out of hand at Sky; during the end credits, Sky is the only channel that goes to commercial breaks, as can be heard on F1TV where only the German soundtrack without commentary can be heard directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two channels have fewer commercials during training than Sky, and they are free-to-air channels.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the program of Sky Sport F1 is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster that broadcasts F1.
Un-ironically, RTL does a better job (except for the ads) with the four races that they are still allowed to broadcast.
So, in any case, the spectacular F1 season is much less enjoyable than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On this one: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multicolored glass x 1.
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and still hasn't been delivered yet.
I contacted the chat twice and have received nothing so far.
"The First Lady told me that it will be shipped on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she has never replied."
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on December 12th, 2019.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short period of time (the fabric has a hole at the front of the chair).
I request assistance/support.
Powerhead pumps are excellent for supplying additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variations by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services compared.
If the pumps are strong enough, they can be used to operate entire plants.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect multiple diffusers.
The MK series has one, two, or four outlets, depending on the model. However, using a fan pump in the aquarium is also recommended to add an accent, such as with an air curtain (which can be found in our shop) or with a decoration that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here, one could name a treasure chest, seashell or something similar.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated design that ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet or similar using an air hose of 4/6 mm...and off you go.
The air pump should be at the same level as or higher than the water level and installed outside.
If the fan pump sits lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed in between.
Simply cut the air hose and insert the valve in between.
This would prevent water from running backwards through the pump out of the pool, if it were to happen.
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouse that consume little energy.
Even though we indicate a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, packages are packed daily and collected daily.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to prevent a little, so that nobody is upset just because it took a little longer.
It would be like that, not everyone understands all the employees who also work in the logistics industry...of course, here, Corona doesn't stop either.
Please do not rate poorly right away just because the delivery is delayed, that is solely the fault of the delivery services.
"Of course, people like to complain about these services, even if we currently say... they have a damn hard time."
This also varies greatly regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in light color here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut's daughter and moderator into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV moderator, and four other passengers undertook a short excursion to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the western part of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under a radiant blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the freshly crowned astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Amid the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were traveling for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961, after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor at the company, while the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not share how much each person paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his missions.
"She simply flew along," said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Even Michael Strahan expressed his enthusiasm.
"The moderator said that he would like to return to space right away."
"New Shepard" flies up to an altitude of 100 kilometers.
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight, reaching a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, experiencing weightlessness at times, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Aviation Federation and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth to be the boundary of space, but there is no binding international regulation.
This was already the third manned space trip by Blue Origin: In the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board himself, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutch person.
In October's second event, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who gained worldwide fame with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin's deputy chief, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry.
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester, and I find the subject quite fascinating in itself. I also have no problem working in the laboratory (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical).
Naturally, I had already informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, but at that time I also thought that I would definitely want to study until I got my PhD.
Currently I have doubts, especially depressing me are the job prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc.), one often hears about great job prospects and the profession being in high demand, while on the other hand, there are reports of unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
Therefore, I would really be interested:
1) What is your current occupation/ job?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/What kind of training did you receive?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you very much for your responses!
I am currently really unsure and considering dropping out of university in 2022 and pursuing an apprenticeship to become a specialist IT technician.
If you have any experience in that, feel free to write it down :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends.
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
So only now a post is added.
Not only before big holidays, like the Christmas holidays, do we experience major stress in our company.
It seems like it's available before holidays and also on bridging days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and companies take a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day weekend coming up.
So, what happened last week?
Everywhere stress.
Lots of emails that absolutely had to be sent before the holiday weekend, orders here and orders there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... well because?
Because "next week then" sounds like too much time has passed and that's not allowed?
Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also really annoyed.
What is this self-flagellation about holidays?
Then why do we still have holidays if we are not allowed to fully enjoy them?
The stress did not come from above, mind you. All the colleagues were very independent in that regard.
My question is simple: Are only we, the Swiss, like this?
Is this our Reformed-Evangelical way?
Or do you know this in the North as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she hasn't bought any presents yet.
"The beautiful thing, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, is that one can simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer of Hit Radio FFH.
She will get in the mood for the celebration by baking cookies and crafting with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
Up until the contemplative days, she still has a few things to do: "For the first time, I haven't bought any presents yet, I need to finally get started."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of molting and rebuilding of feathers.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg of biotin per kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage in bird keeping is exclusively due to nutritional errors.
As the feathers consist of protein-containing substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large portion of animal losses that occur during moulting are due to lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the formulation of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the use of NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin supplement should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is water soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you very much, I have found it.
Unfortunately, still not working.
DDR hand work model of an old building electric locomotive E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and central Germany, this very rare locomotive probably comes from the renovation proposal of the model railroader ME issue 11/1968, used with play traces and missing parts as seen in photos, function is good. The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn society (DRG), designed for hauling heavy coal trains in the Silesian network. The kit may possibly come from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working condition.
In 1924, the German Reichsbahn company commissioned AEG to propose an electric locomotive to transport 2,200 ton coal trains and 530 ton passenger trains at a travel speed of 45 km/h on this route.
A maximum speed of 65 km/h was required.
Thus, in March 1926 the DRG determined the delivery as a 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive with a Tatzlager drive by AEG with the delivery of the mechanical parts, Siemens-Schuckertwerke supplied the electrical parts.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the delivery of six locomotives took place, which were assigned the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
Everyone survived the Second World War and found themselves on the territory of the later GDR afterwards.
In 1946, the locomotives were taken to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
In the Reichsbahn repair shop in Dessau, the reusability of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] As the electrification of the central German network progressed, there was an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight train service. In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
Firstly, the E 04, E 44, and E 94 locomotives that were available in larger quantities were preferred to be built.
Only when it became apparent that the number of E 94 locomotives that could be refurbished could not be further increased, did the E 95 locomotives come into focus for refurbishment.
[4]First, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They arrived at the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in their own circuit schedule ahead of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig, and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of locomotives proved to be problematic.
So it often happened that shooters got stuck during switching operations.
Then the assistant who constantly travels on this locomotive had to loosen the brakes with a hammer and a wooden wedge while driving.
Damage to the driving motors occurred frequently and led to months-long breakdowns of the locomotive.
[5] As there were enough newly built locomotives at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of the electric operation was not planned back then, the Reichsbahn could dispense with old locomotives and most of the mixed classes, so the E 95 were decommissioned.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one person, which would have resulted in problems in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and visibility issues from the driver's cab.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service in mid-1969, the E 95 01 followed them as the last one, which retired on October 5, 1970.
The intended new designation 255 001 was never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a point heating system at Halle main station, as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
It took some time until the officials at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external restoration of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it at a vehicle exhibition at the Dessau Rail Vehicle Factory.
[5] Since then, it belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive took place.
The locomotive is maintained as part of the museum exhibits at the DB Museum in Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new interior and exterior paint job, while the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
The locomotives were in service on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branching branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the middle German network.
The main area of application was initially Silesia.
Handmade model in H0 scale in its original packaging. The functionality is good, but some visual touch-ups are necessary to the locomotive, which can be done by the buyer. It's a bit dusty and has some signs of use, and there's a musty smell due to it being stored in a basement. It's a very rare handmade model produced in a very small quantity. It's possible that the building kit comes from Zschutschke and Bachmann, a small-series company.
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, it is the F parts.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The center beam is held by two feet... unfortunately, they are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't assemble the bed.
The center beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately produced with errors.
The center bar doesn't fit into the designated bracket.
So I will receive new ones.
When will they be sent out?
No, no flats.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the correct ones in terms of their shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they serve their purpose.
They are not flat with me.
Could I have this sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, do you want me to explain the problem again to you?
Residential building fire with two minor injuries and significant damage.
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, according to the police, an estimated damage in the six-figure euro range has occurred on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (district of Landsberg am Lech).
According to the information, two residents were taken to the hospital on Sunday with minor smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police didn't assume it was intentional arson.
The criminal investigation department (Kripo) Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over further investigations.
But it arrives much later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again.
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo.
Uğur Şahin posted a picture of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn".
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not previously publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur released a photo showing his coronavirus vaccination.
Şahin shared that the illness of a friend had prompted him.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There were false information in social media that I allegedly was not vaccinated.
"In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine", wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the social network "LinkedIn".
"For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself while getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far he has rejected it because communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe Covid-19 illness and has been hanging on a ventilator for three weeks.
"The school friend and his family are not vaccinated," Şahin wrote further."
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause seems to be anxiety, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences for that reason.
There is an interview circulating on the internet with Deutsche Welle, in which Uğur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as clarified by Deutsche Welle itself.
"At the moment, it is not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin at that time.
There is a prioritization in Germany for the administration of the vaccine.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has long been lifted - and according to his own statements, the Biontech CEO has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in switchgear: Tens of thousands of people without power
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases, probably also no heating.
A fire had disabled a power substation.
After a fire with severe damages in a transformer station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to live without electricity for about 24 hours.
On Friday evening, due to the fire, the lights went out in several communities affecting 41,000 residents.
The provider Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power generators were in operation on Saturday until the widespread outage could finally be completely resolved in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers from THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered child care places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The provider thanked the affected parties for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
"We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions."
"We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the primary technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of damages will take a few more days as the Westnetz technicians have initially only been able to put some lines back into operation temporarily, he explained.
According to company statements, a technical defect caused the fire.
Power is flowing again.
The fire that broke out around 7.15 pm on Friday reportedly caused significant damage to parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation, according to Westnetz.
There, extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had power again.
An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid have been gradually connected from 9:30 pm onwards.
Since 11:15 pm, even those who were last affected by the outage have electricity.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were in operation.
The authorities had also called for neighborhood assistance after setting up emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is important now that citizens take care of older or single people in their neighborhoods and inform their local fire station if help is needed," explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
Setting up and operating emergency power generators primarily focused on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who were unable to care for themselves or who require electricity-dependent medical devices or are dependent on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is about the bedspread #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy ♡.
But I can't mount the base on the table top.
It is about Custom #NAME#.
There are three versions of it.
We wanted those with tabletops diameter of #NUMBER#.
We have received a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I cannot slide them together and therefore shorten them.
Can you help me further with this?
Otherwise, I would have to send it back because it is not suitable for the purpose otherwise.
I would appreciate feedback.
Yes, that is really easier!
Then let's do it that way!
Can you please send me the return form by email?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic combined skiing: Combined skier Riiber wins.
The German Nordic combined skiers Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
Once again, the duo had to give in to the outstanding Norwegian, Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a large lead into the cross-country skiing portion after the ski jumping.
Return of order number #NUMBER#.
When will the money be refunded to my account?
"Yes, we have both made it new and are using version 4.5..."
It could be that you have already heard of problems.
I directly bought a book with my #PRS_ORG# and it seems to be included.
As soon as I want to open it, the message "oops!" pops up.
This document could not be opened.
File may be defective, please contact customer service.
As far as I can see, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me further?
The chat connection is lost, now what?
I also have to work in between!
To ensure an even and clean application of paint, you should clean the components with some soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and dry them off.
Before you apply a new color to the model with the brush for the first time, it is recommended to practice with 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do that on the inside of the parts that will no longer be visible later or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component.
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Slight overlapping of the layers of paint provides a uniform surface later on.
Avoid fast back and forth brushing with the brush.
This results in surfaces that appear unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could otherwise shine through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors are applied at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metallic streaks can occur when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before assembling them.
The models achieve their authentic look through the use of decals or stickers.
From national insignia on airplanes to ship names and decorative trims and badges on automotive models, decals give the models their finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the right sequence while the components are still easily accessible.
An airplane cockpit can be more easily stickered before it is installed into the fuselage.
More important than having the right tools like scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks when sticking is having time, patience, and a steady hand.
Cut each needed decal individually and place them in front of you.
Decals are also called water slide decals, because you briefly moisten their backside with water until the carrier paper becomes dark through the wetness.
Then you push the picture just a small distance from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the backing paper sideways.
Attention: always check first if the image is properly aligned before completely pushing it off the paper, so that it does not stick to your finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Suck up excess water with a household cloth.
Warning not suitable for children under 3 years old.
I can only briefly open a book, once I look away to something else, then I can no longer read the book and have to log out and log in again and reload the book and find the place where I stopped reading.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I receive this via email?
"Also for all 3 packages?"
Because the lamp arrived in 3 separate packages with me.
ok nevertheless, thank you very much!
Then I'll buy elsewhere as soon as I get the money back.
But can I get it back without any problems?
Fertility treatment with private health insurance / What is an "insurance claim"?
Hello everyone,
We were undergoing fertility treatment for some time, but now when it comes to billing with the private health insurance, it is suddenly causing problems.
In order:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the private health insurance and received the approval for 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the private health insurance.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child and attempted 2 (unsuccessful) times, but did not yet reconcile them with the private health insurance (PKV) account.
We once again applied for coverage of costs from the private health insurance and were granted three additional attempts again.
After several more attempts (we performed more attempts than promised, logically calculating the most expensive ones with private health insurance) we submitted the invoices to the private health insurance and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the private health insurance only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment are forfeited.
The second desire to have a child is a new insurance case.
According to the general terms and conditions, "The insurance event begins with the medical treatment, and it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions for the experts in the round here:
Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts will be reimbursed) or us (5 attempts are to be reimbursed)?
Should the PKV have informed us in the promises that further attempts would be forfeited with a birth?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by having the first child.
"It would be great if the experts could give their opinion here."
Thank you very much in advance for your help!
Can you please send me the three options via email and tell me how I can best reach them again?
Okay.
We will not order anything from them anymore.
If they add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer.
They may forward that to their manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday my colleague told me that the repayment had been arranged and now you're telling me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't really help it if the dresser arrives completely distressed at my place.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written.
It is clearly stated that the repayment has been processed and I still have not received any repayment from #PRS_ORG#.
You can tell your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after several months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain a different type of packaging.
I will dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company in that way.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#.
These products are advertised with stools that can be purchased additionally, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can you help?
Topic of the week: The best low-budget films.
There is no general definition with exact budget limits for what a low-budget film is.
Wikipedia has the following to say about it:
Ein **Low-Budget-Film** oder **Low-Budget-Movie** ist ein Film, der mit wenig bis keiner Finanzierung von einem großen Filmstudio oder einem privaten Investor gedreht wurde.
On the internet, you can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What attracts you to it?
And what perhaps doesn't appeal to you at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask for the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it reliable now?
Thank you.
Best regards
"If there's no telephone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!"
Unfortunately, there is no change in the waiting position...I will soon give up again because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half victory" against Belarus associated with high costs for the EU.
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
"The costs, however, are very high and represent massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania," Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd)."
According to the researcher from the Berlin-based Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP), the EU did not solve the confrontation sustainably.
This state of limbo - Belarus is not completely giving in, but the EU feels like the winner - will probably continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that dealing with people at the border was not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights.
Apparently there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
As the EU as a whole does not decisively turn against it, this comes at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion in the union at the same time.
"She apparently cannot assert herself if a member state decides to do its own thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border control agency Frontex access to the border.
Furthermore, according to Bossong, the EU pays another price for its policy on the border with Belarus: a fundamental agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult because the line "border control, border control, border control" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border.
According to Poland's border protection, migrants have once again attempted to cross over into Polish territory through Belarus.
"A spokesperson for the authority said that 55 migrants were arrested and returned to the border during the night on Sunday."
The Polish officials were allegedly pelted with stones by migrants in the incident near the place of Czeremsza.
According to the information provided, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
Overall, the border protection registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko as the ruler in Minsk of having lured them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania closed off sections of their border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to countries of origin of people in order to prevent departures from there.
Bossong said that the most effective element of the EU's response is the pressure on airlines.
"There, the EU has leveraged its market power and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough methods and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also consider domestic political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly smuggle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale.
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula One finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged a protest.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken in violation of the rules.
A second protest was filed against the evaluation at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes' perspective, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the final lap and raced towards his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutch car in front of him had been overtaken.
I am checking that.
I will speak to the bank and contact you again later.
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg fan day.
The Europa-Park, the namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of SC Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg fan day.
As the park announces, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from the Breisgau region, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park free of charge on this day.
Additionally, there were vouchers for drinks and sausage.
The roller coaster cars shone on that day through the red and white jerseys.
"Füchsle, Ed Euromaus, and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," according to the park.
The partnership between the Bundesliga team and the theme park located in Rust, 40km north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 90s.
At the first SC Freiburg fan day at Europa-Park, it was once again shown how well the partnership fits.
"Seeing radiant fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms it," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not originally €1699?

Verstappen finished seventh at the Malaysian Grand Prix in Sepang.
2016, Spain: In his first race for Red Bull, Verstappen wins straight away.
At the age of 18 years and 228 days, he becomes the youngest Grand Prix winner in Formula 1 history in Barcelona, sensationally.
2019, Hungary: Verstappen celebrates his first pole position in Budapest - he is not the youngest.
At 21 years old, he leaves Valtteri Bottas and his Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton behind.
2021, Abu Dhabi: The summit has been reached.
At the Formula 1 season finale in Abu Dhabi, Verstappen celebrates his first world championship title at the age of 24 - with an overtaking maneuver against Hamilton in the final lap. dpa
At that time, I already had a huge problem with you when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# chest of drawers.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim".
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord," author Judith Hermann read from her latest novel "Daheim" at the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also served as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and sensibly listens to the nighttime sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an item yesterday, but did not receive any email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has time for your crazy chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you should fix and not all of ours from the household.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I cannot chat with them every day.
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that either I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a new order for the #PRS_ORG# nightstand, and a return label.
This email has not arrived yet.
The package wants to be delivered to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me.
Sincerely yours / Best regards

Sorry, but just because he says he is not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
This is like when an AFD supporter says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will give in.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should simply completely refrain from doing so.
Well, then you are equally not to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution fundamentally is simply completely lost.
As far as I'm concerned, a God set the whole thing in motion.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you must believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just talking nonsense.
And by that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously any more than Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be brought as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows for practically distortion and color error-free use of the magnifying glass up to the edge zone.
Frequently, magnifying glasses are marked with magnification indications.
However, these specifications only apply to precisely defined conditions that rarely correspond to usage conditions.
To make optimal use of your magnifying glass, we kindly ask you to observe the instructions in the table "Technical Specifications" (see user manual in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the surface of the lenses of all optical devices, including magnifying glasses.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
When the optimal usage conditions are observed - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
You can find further instructions in the enclosed user manual (available in German and English language).

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: Women in the municipality of Krembz select the trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many curious situations while selling fir trees.
Once, a man is said to have even driven back home without his partner because they could not agree.
Every year he plants about 2000 pieces for it.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
He says that always makes the pre-Christmas time a bit fun.
"And what about the voucher??"
Otherwise, will I be gone as a customer?!
At any rate, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions here about the better dish, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both therefore have their name.
In English, an equivalent might be something like "turner," which certainly doesn't sound as appetizing.
Problems with fiber optics + Devolo DLan/Magic.
We have had a new fiber optic connection in our house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I am currently having trouble setting up a stable WiFi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which, except for a few failures, received and sent out 50 Mbit flawlessly.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and through the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, they arrive.
However, on the other powerline adapter, which emits the WiFi signal, no longer the full 500 (units) come through, but the further away I am in the house from the adapter, the less (units) come through (for example, if I use a socket that is located 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other adapter).
This results in the Internet being slower with the new fiber optic connection on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was indeed slightly better than the DLan, but here too there were similar large losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" with fiber optic through the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables in the house.
I am really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
Therefore, I would be even more pleased to receive a reply.
When it's time to switch the checking account.
Anyone who thought that there would be peace for current accounts now is mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks from their customers, the exemption limits for negative interest rates continue to decrease.
For example, Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous for a long time with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the tax-free allowance and even quadrupled it for the daily money.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for checking and savings accounts and to 25,000 euros for money market accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower exemptions apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a spokesperson upon request.
And not only for new contracts but also for "new individually agreed agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already lowered the limit to 50,000 euros before, which still applies, as does at ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular among cost-conscious customers, has lowered the tax-free allowance in two steps, first to €50,000 and now to €25,000.
Anyway: According to the numbers of the internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have a tax-free allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
Even the Sparda-Bank Berlin has reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with consumer centers going on there, who have even won the case in the first instance in front of the Berlin Regional Court regarding this regulation.
Now there are already discussions in the banks as to whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in case the higher authorities also declare negative interest rates in principle to be inadmissible and many millions have to be refunded to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a rollercoaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) has been chosen as the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers takes care of her appearance.
Nevertheless, according to Aniston, she indulges herself in one chip a day (yes, you read that right: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
That both female and male fans equally adore you is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she simply has bad luck with happiness - and still searches for true love.
"And crossed off the desire for a baby from the list."
Before, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what is medically wrong with me personally, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
One can only hope that success and fame also bring happiness.
Undignified end to a career: Räikkönen must retire.
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After making a driving error and lightly touching the wall, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix before even completing half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the top motorsport class.
For the farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started from pole position 18 times, and stood on the podium 103 times. dpa
"Friedrich secures 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bobsleigh - Sports"
The target of the bobsledder is the record of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 victories.
"I've calculated it, I would need to win nine and a half races per season to make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he first defended against the attack by Johannes Lochner by five hundredths of a second, as he went from third place to first.
Then he made a change to the material settings and achieved a larger lead by 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
With his team of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg), and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the British contestant Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also achieved his 22nd consecutive win.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, finished in fifth place this time after previously coming in second place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after coming in fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, then I would do it that way too," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won her third season victory in the two-man bobsled race on her home track among the women.
After only reaching the fourth place in monobob on the previous day, she raced to the World Cup victory on Sunday with pusher Deborah Levi in the German triple victory.
Two-person bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She achieved her first podium finish of the winter season alongside her Olympic qualification.
Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me, it was super cool getting my first podium finish in the World Cup. I am super happy that Mariama took me along.
I am super happy with the development.
"There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just about pushing, there's also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the rides that were not completely error-free, but said: "We are going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I have just not received it and therefore could not redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now they said it had expired which made me very upset.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order it again, as it is currently reduced :)
Why will the shipping only start on March 16th?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it, an extra field with the notification appears.
Was taken over by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelving module, precisely a new undamaged one.
And do not cancel the entire order.
Only this day left, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely great girls and ladies and women,
I have a few things that I just want to write down and maybe some of you feel the same way...
I am 24, have complex post-traumatic stress disorder, a full-time student, and a dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he is basically my child.
My friend (together for 6 years) is sick, he got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him shower (because his hand is in a bandage due to a burn).
He also caught a cold and currently we see each other less (1-2x a week), which is causing me a lot of distress with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy is currently having a stomach ache, so I cooked for him and now he's lying in his cuddly blanket, feeling a bit more relaxed after I used the heat lamp and stroked him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is currently away for a month.
Now we also have housework to do, which we of course divide among ourselves.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD illness is currently well managed, I am fairly well treated and coping.
Not good, but I manage and am almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot from me. Tomorrow at 3pm, I have a written test for which I have not yet prepared anything, and the day after tomorrow is anatomy class for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week, I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more space.
So here's my week: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then it continues, right?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it continues eternally.
I think I am just so stressed right now that I need these mental clues, because otherwise I can't handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't manage it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Truly infinitely grateful, I cannot put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my PTSD otherwise.
I believe that this is partly related to the mental load of women, and that's why I think I will find some fellow sufferers here.
I wish you all a relaxing evening, we've almost made it through the week!
Today I received my order, unfortunately it is a completely different color and the surface is scratched, and the table leg has an imprint.
With the first delivery, the color was exactly like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we exchange the table now, will I get a different color?
The email for cancellation was sent on December 26th, #NUMBER#.
In addition, two times.
But she was not confirmed.
Something completely different: Back in school, I noticed that many religious teachers didn't believe in God and for them, it was just another subject like Math or Geography.
For me, that was always something strange, maybe also because I was raised Christian and so I always somehow believed.
What is your stance on this?
Maybe you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
In general, I understand the difference between personal and professional matters, and it makes sense to keep them separate.
There's also a curriculum, etc.
But I would also find it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes someone want to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Preserve culture or something?
I hope your question is not too personal.
Cannot it be changed or not? I prefer writing in English, as I understand it well.
That is already very long, then I would refrain from it.
Alright, thank you.
I expect a response soon, by no later than the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support, #NAME#.
Movie search assistance please
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the movie, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the Modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
As I cannot describe it any closer anyways, there is a young woman in the real world.
"And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean)."
For some reason, paths cross and a plot arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm in order to be able to live himself, I think.
I believe that the transition is also the soldier's grave.
At the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If this means something to you, I would be grateful for any answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on their belly since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can endure much more than one thinks.
Make sure that everything around is okay, no stuffed animals, check in and look around more often, but no minute surveillance.
That drives you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but has always had a blanket.
Watch your child when it's sleeping.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it raise itself up from the belly?
Or is it face down directly on the mattress?
You can deduce from that whether everything is fine.
We all grew up too and when my husband was born, it was common practice to lay the kids on their bellies to sleep.
Furthermore, we are already a "regular customer" with you and have bought many articles.
But why are you only offering me 20EUR then?
Hello, I already wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received any feedback so far.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the cabinet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The wardrobe is currently not usable.
To put it very plainly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV as well.
Just that it is simply the case that the politics of this channel have now gone downhill.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then to go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that they were an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote by Arno: "We don't want to be a walking billboard."
What am I now?
A 0815 advertising channel that tries to sell its cheap merchandise to the elite fan.
And then we still have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
This applies naturally to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
They are allowed to continue insulting people, of course.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to make a profit at the expense of the action with the rented rooms that exploded.
How can one find all of this good?
Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I request a callback as the wooden table I received was delivered with a defect.
Body breakage due to damaged delivery of #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for stomach ache or just for cuddling - my little heat friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications because cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily warmed in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the use especially comfortable so that the little ones feel secure even if they are not feeling well.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following areas of application:
Before warming the pillow, check for unusual odors, mold or marks of burning, and discard immediately if they are present.
Please remove the inner cushion for heating from the cover beforehand.
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (observe the information provided by the microwave manufacturer!).
Directly after heating, evenly distribute the warmth throughout the cushion by shaking it!
Next, put the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the first warm-ups, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, which disappears with repeated use.
Absolutely follow the given heating instructions as longer times or higher energy output can cause damage (risk of ignition and burns!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, check that heating grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (maximum 43°C) on your forearm!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruises or open wounds, as well as for people with reduced pain sensitivity.
For existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes, or cancer conditions as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose kernels come out, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and keep them inaccessible to children.
If the product is applied on babies under 1 year, the temperature of the child should be regularly monitored during the application to rule out overheating.
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country where the user is located.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30 °C.
Please pay attention to the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt finishes second after first half of season - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf.
Darmstadt 98 can dream of a return to the German football Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone in the standings.
For Ingolstadt, it's not working out under the third coach either.
Celebration in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top match, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
Last night my laptop (Thinkpad E480 20KQ and approximately 3 years old) was no longer charging through my power supply.
I purchased this about 5 months ago, so it should still be working.
I thought that the power supply alone is sufficient for operation.
Negative display, the battery is empty and the laptop does not start even though the power adapter is plugged in.
After that, I removed the battery, but still nothing happens.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop while it's plugged in?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I would like the delivery of #PRS_ORG# to my room.
How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still carrying a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
Capacity of 20 liters can easily accommodate larger photo equipment, which can be safely stored with the help of padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever other everyday items you need stay well-organized and separate from the camera equipment, thanks to practical access points in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design is proverbially impressive - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to photography equipment in a matter of seconds.
This works with two options: Firstly, conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in the messenger bags.
There is a metal closure hook with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack attached to the closure flap.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels" in this case: there are 4 anchor bars, sturdily riveted, into which the closing hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a lower one.
The snap closure and hook are also magnetic.
This way, the backpack can be reliably closed without engaging the clasp.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other camera backpacks: in addition to the top flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to dig through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the practicality of the backpack: if you not only carry your camera equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more information below) and thus store both items separately without any problems - and also access them independently through the two side openings.
This way, you can also pull the backpack from the right side to the front of your body to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday items remain secure in the left half of the backpack and do not get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable straps help with that.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the contents will remain dry even if it is to go to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from your support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commission.
The delivery company has announced contact to pick up the wrongly delivered table.
So far, I haven't received any message.
I request immediate processing.
I am now already writing with the third support staff member, with none of them have I gotten further than a promise that I will receive an email confirmation.
It concerns the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
Is it foreseeable when the wardrobe could be delivered again?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It works.
Many many thanks for the help.
Wishing you a lovely evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
The order and payment were made on January 12, 2021.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than what I ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend my voucher, then I will place a larger order right away, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And I couldn't have foreseen that the past year would turn out differently than expected, and therefore I was unable to redeem and clarify it in a timely manner.
But I, as a customer, bear the damage and I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast material and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All customized glass panels are produced in short series according to individual technical properties that are specific to certain panels and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created that focuses on balancing the disc according to the characteristics of the original installation.
The tinted discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additional created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the cutouts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned windows emphasize the character of every car through an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event influenced the history of the West Coast.
In winter 1848, a man discovered glowing nuggets in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news quickly spread and sparked the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were marked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was said: "Coloma or bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who is seeking wealth in the West and wants to make a name for yourself.
"You will search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and build enterprises."
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers apparently have the same idea!
You have to outperform your pioneer colleagues to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources and construct a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma) to 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection will be revealed and they place their pioneers at the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it receives a barrier!
This deactivates one half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions available there.
Then the players take turns performing actions, such as acquiring resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunmen.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers will return.
The announcer rotates to a new location at the beginning of each round and thereby changes the available actions.
This continues until the promoter has moved five times, thus covering each location once and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lesser rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is calculated.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I choose the shipping method "Warensendung" (games wrapped in foil) for items up to the size of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
For everything else, mostly insured and traceable through DPD (games wrapped in film, wrapped in fabric, and packed with paper).
If you are a collector, I can also ship cardboard inside the box for an additional fee of 2 euros, so that there is a 100% guarantee of no printing pressure marks.
"Why Children are not Tyrants," Documentary, ARD Media Library.
Psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power.
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
"The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and lectures across Europe."
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce debate on parenting.
Former patients and guardians are now leveling serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We as parents and other responsible individuals should never, never, never prioritize power over the child.
Our aim must always be to give the child space for their development and to make the framework for the child as big as is sensible and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: States discuss elimination of testing requirement for triple vaccinated individuals.
The health ministers of the states want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide abolition of the testing requirement for fully vaccinated individuals.
"We countries need clarity quickly on whether and from when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag."
The abolition of 2G plus for triple vaccinated individuals is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional vaccination incentive," said Holetschek.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Conference of Health Ministers on this matter already next Tuesday" - afp.
So, I want to send the lamp back.
What is the best way for me to proceed there?
Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
"I can no longer process any purchases through my #PRS_ORG#."
Notification: Oops, an error occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# website on the computer works.
I have updated my account information.
What could be the reason for this?
What you are describing is known as *awareness*, which is sensory perception during general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, this results in hearing noises/voices, less frequently in seeing images, and rarest of all in perceiving pain.
Relevant for this topic: Cesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, since a very deep anesthesia to protect the child until the cutting of the umbilical cord is avoided.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anesthesia consultation.
Certain anesthesia methods such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine describes awareness correctly, however, u/Nitemarex did not have it by definition.
I read your comment wrong.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is not only a legal obligation, but also a standard in the eCommerce sector.
Please double check if you can at least take back the defective chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
Then we also lose quite a bit of money.
I already sent you an email, which you have not answered.
Again, the question.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The shipper is company #NAME#.
I just called over there.
I was informed that they only deliver to the doorstep - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order as I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Am I not being called?
I had formulated a question.
Theatre historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97.
He has established himself as a theater critic and as an artistic director.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There lies the new book on the table, fresh off the press: "An Old Man Gets Older".
The poignant diary of a slow farewell from the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby express my gratitude for my life."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common ones are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets that are mainly used as cargo carriers in the European region.
You will be certified by the European Pallet Association (EPAL).
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not collected.

Roulade Tips & Tricks
I had received many great tips here a week ago for making the perfect goulash.
That was served during Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and tender like butter!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I have developed a taste for it and want to cook Rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will prepare a beef broth/stock.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
What happens next?
What about the books, and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't as good anymore, but I can manage it.
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed by email on January 18th that the refund was processed.
But until today, the money has not arrived with me.
Would you please check that.
Where to still find Christmas roast in the area of Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of the Christmas holidays as the Christmas tree and gifts.
Have you not purchased any poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We'll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube power amplifier significantly contributes to the warmth and richness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can adjust the desired level and distortion content of your sounds.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, with which one can reduce the sound level without changing anything on the "gain" and distortion.
Earlier it was mentioned that with the POWER LEVEL knob, you can even create a power reserve if it gets outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL control, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal attached here is processed with a speaker simulation so that even when using headphones or direct recordings, you get an impressive "acoustic" sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuning device.
If you treat yourself to a VFS5 footswitch, you can conveniently access the sounds by foot, turn the effect blocks on and off, and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new powerhouses, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But had seen it in others.
Is it then possible for you to send the lamp back?
"Because it hangs too low over a dining table?"
So I would like to return it then.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we receive another update in the next few weeks regarding the exact delivery date?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs before?
If it's not possible, I would also be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
Under certain circumstances, I might find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need are a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were intended to be part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
That is not a satisfying answer and the waiting time was not worth it.
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations over nuclear agreement.
According to the Iranian statement, progress is being made in the negotiations for the revival of the international atomic agreement.
"Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri said on Sunday to the news agency Irna that both sides are close to reaching an agreement on the topics that are to be discussed."
"This is a 'positive and important development', because at the beginning there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated."
The agreement is supposed to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reviving the agreement were resumed after a brief interruption of almost one week.
Representatives of Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France, and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
Also a US delegation is on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with the highest COVID-19 incidence rate.
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value exceeds the mark of 1000.
Thuringia was the only federal state where the Corona incidence rate was above 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day incidence rate as 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has consistently had the highest incidence nationwide, this value was at 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence rate in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but had still been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
On Sunday, 200 people with severe COVID-19 were treated in hospitals with intensive care.
There may be reporting delays on weekends.
In addition, health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are barely keeping up with tracking new cases.
I understand that.
As the delivery will only be made at the beginning of March, perhaps it will be possible by then.
I have to print it out, stick it on the package, and drop it off at the post office, is that it?
Do I not have to click/indicate/fill out anything else here?
Exactly what I want to avoid, that is why I am writing to you.
I would like to take responsibility for the return shipment at my own expense, please.
8 euro return fee is a cheek in my eyes.
It is time for changes.
###Members of the Bundestag, greetings to you! I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What is the purpose of the post here?
If you take a look at the activity in the past months of the Bundestag, you can make one observation: it is non-existent.
We have gone into hibernation for the winter and have extended the summer slump for a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the reason for it?
For the most part, this probably has to do with dissatisfaction with how certain things have been handled here and with how we generally stand.
In recent days, the impression has increasingly shown that many here still really have the desire for the Bundestag.
#What we need to change.
At this point, the MBundestag community is asked to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who became aware of this project in the last few days and found a, to put it simply, mess.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have found the desire to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, as only then can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server for this purpose, where we can exchange ideas with each other and work on concrete things.
You can join the server using this link.
Objectives:
How should the German Bundestag function in the future?
Which existing orders need to be changed/adapted/removed?
How should we present ourselves to the outside in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How can we create a fair electoral system?
"I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's okay because we have Discord at the end."
If you are interested and have time, come to Discord, work together and let's democratically decide about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you, which is yet to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too large/bulky for it and not suitable for my taste.
For this, I have already ordered a different mounting from you.
I assembled it and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I will receive a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in extra large size, for example, 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be collected promptly.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but I will dismantle the wardrobe as much as possible for pick-up - you will need to coordinate with #PRS_ORG# on how that can work.
#PRS_ORG# can always contact me by phone to arrange a pickup appointment.
Is there an instruction manual for the assembly?
How long would I have time to get them or decide for the return?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague whom I like.
She herself has lived as a vegetarian for a while and currently eats meat very rarely.
I myself was a vegetarian for several years before.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I honestly answered without much thought.
And that is, that I used to think that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but eventually reflected and understood that I am ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I got the impression that she became displeased with me. She then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian, she reduced animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "clumsy"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan, you can quickly be cornered and conflicts arise without intending to.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception according to § 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be present on the assigned date for #PRS_ORG# to collect my return.
As I can't be there in person due to a funeral, unfortunately, that can't be changed either.
Can an alternative pick-up date be assigned to me, please?
Starting from February 1st, I will be consistently available again.
Lahnstein weir equipped for water rescue: €45,000 grant from the state.
Recently, the Minister of the Interior of Rhineland-Palatinate, Roger Lewentz, presented a grant in the amount of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the volunteer fire department in Lahnstein to the Lord Mayor Peter Labonte in the town hall of Lahnstein.
The total costs of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
"I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment vehicle is used by the diving team Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, one permanently expects rising operations: The boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel rivers and the increasing use of the Lahn river as a leisure destination contribute to this.
I bought a book which I could only read 10% of, and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed your recommendations, but syncing, removing and reloading the app did NOT work.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole thing has already cost me a lot of time and now I am hoping for help.
Okay, so be it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a delivery date during the ordering process?

Thanks first of all for taking on this entire issue, I too spent nearly a decade in public service in a similar capacity, meaning we were also armed personnel in the executive branch, but I don't want to go into further detail on that.
I find the question about right and left always asked in a very simplified way.
Basically, one should say that of course the government official comes more from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should actually be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that people who are drawn to uniform and weapons, especially those on the right side of conservative, are naturally attracted to them. It is also clear that these people may have difficulty dealing with reality, because among the average white population there are now many Germans with immigrant backgrounds, women, and also homosexuals (and I don't mean the overly feminine gay stereotypes, because these are rare in law enforcement). Instead, there are normal men and women whom you wouldn't be able to tell unless they told you. I can and must rely on these people, because in a crisis they will save your life or put theirs on the line for you.
But even these marginalized groups, even if it may sound strange at first, in my experience also have a conservative attitude, meaning they are proud of Germany and feel less represented by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this politics supposedly advocates for them or thinks it has to please them, they just want to be treated normally.
Back to the rights, since police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme right-wing ideologies among them. However, it is completely exaggerated and frustrating that these individuals are allowed to openly express their views or even openly plot plans that endanger the state.
Of course, it happens that especially police officers and soldiers who have often been deployed abroad begin to generalize and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences.
It also happens that certain right-wing fellows meet and engage in lively exchanges of ideas.
However, in my opinion, such things are well combated and countered with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally intertwined, and in my opinion, that is a good thing because we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis among our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I ordered the other basket on the German site as well.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I already ordered in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order that is no longer available for delivery.
I was chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket in black be delivered to Germany for #NUMBER# euros or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany?
I always only find you as a partner company.
but at the top edge of the wooden part there are two deep notches filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself there is a small scratch.
More organized because of a child?
Hello, I (w32) have been preoccupied with something for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed with very little free time), but for my whole life, I have struggled to keep my household consistently clean and tidy.
There are always phases where everything piles up, and now and then it grabs me and I tidy up and clean.
But it's actually never the case that "someone could come to visit spontaneously".
My husband is (unfortunately) not any better, it bothers me somewhere, but mostly household loses against work and lack of motivation.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly as we enjoy cooking.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more orderly with a child?
We don't have one yet but we're working on it, and this question has been on my mind for a while.
Because I don't have any motivation for it, it just doesn't bother me so much as long as no one visits and, for example, there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child bring greater motivation or make one lazy?
Looking forward to your replies.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality as well as anatomically preformed cut provides maximum comfort, perfect fit, and thus allows almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, further embossment on the joints for improved freedom of movement (in arm and knee bends).
For the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 has been more than doubled to increase comfort even further.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, elbow and knee bends).
High-quality preforms in the lower back area and in the crotch ensure a snug, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back zipper and improves comfort, especially when bending down and when mounting and donning equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back ensures increased flexibility during arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a warming, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) sealing at the face on the hood increases comfort, sealing, and durability (separate head hood).
Soft zone in the collar improves the sealing with a finely adjustable width adjustment through a flexible, gentle Velcro closure that does not adhere to the lamination or seams.
Double cuffs with zippers on the wrists and ankles connect a foldable inner cuff with a soft, laminated neoprene outer cuff.
45-degree notch at the end of the inner sleeve for increased elasticity and durability when putting on.
Long zipper at the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without a hood.
Long G-Lock P back zipper (overall without hood) with metal slider and incorporated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat patent).
Zippers on arms and legs.
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent tearing in case excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels flush bonded with outer and inner overlap.
Edges of the outer cuffs hemmed for greater durability.
Edges of the inner cuffs notched for increased flexibility.
The original Beuchat system was designed to secure the computer in its place, especially during deep dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist computers).
Career in social work - as someone with a dependent personality disorder?
I completed training in software development and have been fully trained for approximately one year now.
Unfortunately, I am realizing more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for some time now.
The problem is that I have an avoidant personality disorder characterized by self-doubt and anxiety (AVPD).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and am consequently shy.
I don't have a problem to talk with people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I've been told several times that I appear unapproachable (although I think it's gotten better).
Can I become a social worker that way?
I don't really want to work as a street worker or in an open youth club, but rather, for example, in addiction counseling or family assistance.
But I don't know if the actual work routine is really like I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find anything about it on the internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems in my job (emotionally) because it brings me down every time there is something to criticize about my code ("messing up the simplest things again") and I find it difficult to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should already know how to do this"/"I'm holding him up with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm intellectually challenged" etc.).
I will probably have problems in every profession but I wanted to mention it at this point.
But have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that.
I am waiting for an appointment for pickup.
What do you mean by "return please!"?
When I downloaded a book onto my #PRS_ORG#, the message "Your #PRS_ORG# is not authorized to read this book" appeared.
Are there any problems?
I was in a chat with #PRS_ORG#, he asked me if I received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein consumed with the food is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into individual protein constituents (amino acids) and is then used to build its own protein substances, which it also needs for feather formation.
The formation of plumage in nestlings and the regrowth of feathers in molting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high level of strain on the animal's entire organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as this can cause disruptions in the breeding process.
After this therapeutic dose of NEKTON-Bio, daily vitamin supplementation should be resumed with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement preparation).
The protein taken in with the feed is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and it then uses these to build up its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
The formation of feathers in the nestling and the regeneration of feathers in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are particularly demanding for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as this can lead to disruptions in the hatching process.
Following this temporary administration of NEKTON-Bio, one should resume the daily supply of vitamins with NEKTON-S (multivitamin supplement) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement).
1 g NEKTON-Bio in 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to only prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
One leveled measuring spoon (enclosed) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the start of feather regeneration is visible.
Afterwards, the normal dosage will be administered until the regrowth of feathers is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without exposure to sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That's really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday informing that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Have you received this email?
Statement of a community worker in contradiction to the statute.
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So, an application for a trap has been submitted to the municipality.
An employee wrote to me that the felling of fruit trees, including walnut trees, is not part of the bylaws.
However, in the bylaws, the walnut tree is specifically listed as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clearly defined.
I thank you for your responses.
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message.
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or voucher?
What was more expensive then?
Yes, I think so. The only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?

Advice and Ideas for Further Career Opportunities
First of all, Merry Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is unfortunately only mediocre because my dear head is currently overthinking everything that can be overthought.
Before I go into detail here .. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm currently doing teacher training as a lateral entrant.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked in a certain field (to at least remain somewhat anonymous, I won't mention anything specific here).
But then it was all too boring for me, and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up with teaching degrees and I was sure that this was it - even though the conditions were much less flexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now reached the third "I google other job advertisements".
And only half a year has passed.
In the times before, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, afterwards I can still switch if necessary.
But right now, I am absolutely exhausted.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted.
Now it's vacation time, but still there is a ton of work waiting for me.
Before my time as a trainee teacher, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekends were still my weekends and my after-work time was still my after-work time.
I had a day off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even family gatherings are too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that irritate me additionally.
Basically, it's fun and from an outside perspective, the referee is doing well in terms of feedback and such.
But I am completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can handle before it completely shuts down - if it's not already doing so.
I wonder if I want to continue like this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here. Or if I should go back to my old field where I was valued, could take time off when I needed it, and although I found the work somewhat boring, I was fairly paid and worked as part of a team and not as a lone wolf, which is mostly the case now.
But then I ask myself if in a year I will not have arrived at the same point as now and be dissatisfied.
You can sense that everything is somehow confused, but maybe as an outsider, you have advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation where I am completely exhausted and start to cry at the slightest thought of it.
I won't make any emotional decisions right now, as that will probably lead to no good outcome.
But maybe your opinions will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for the time being.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny tone from me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series by VOX has continuously evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuitry, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier, among other things.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up-to-date in terms of sound technology.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on an analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multistage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on genuine analog circuits, because they simply achieve the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances spring forth.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and distort historical facts on the virtual level until the amplifier and effects sound exactly as you've always imagined it.
The perfect combination of tube sound and modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined multiple times to meet newly added sound requirements, which led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the portable VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed so that all guitarists in search of maximum sound variety will find what they're looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that it is particularly the power amplifier that determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier equipped with a 12AX7 tube perfectly recreates the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers.
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven points by his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually positionable and foldable Velcro dividers, it adapts completely to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack naturally depends on the size of the camera and lenses.
One possible equipment would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a detachable flash.
Bigger mirrorless cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leaves space for additional lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photographic items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: likely the longest in history.
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows have caused major damage on the Canary Island.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the recorded history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, lasting 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data available regarding previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has somewhat decreased in the past few days, but volcanologists still did not make any prediction as to when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
"The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Damages amounting to millions.
In the almost three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 residential buildings and other structures, as reported by RTVE.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That's equivalent to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damages are estimated to be over 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new peninsulas were formed by cooled lava, with a total size of approximately 50 hectares.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and on which about half of the approximately 85,000 residents live directly or indirectly, was particularly severely affected and was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed and additional areas were heavily affected, wrote the newspaper "El País."
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly celebration.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas belongs to the few traditional occasions that still hold together our increasingly divided society.
All the more important is to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss has been a peacemaking "social contract of primitive societies", escapes the rigid routine and can be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Saint Nicholas became the Christ child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked the Christmas holidays with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were handed out on St. Nicholas Day in one way or another.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as the bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women in one night to spare them from a life of sin.
This unconventional way of gift giving gave rise to the popular German tradition of filling boots, especially those of children, with presents.
Protestants objected to this tradition because they reject the veneration of saints as intermediaries between God and humanity.
For these reasons, they oppose the institution.
Martin Luther transformed St. Nicholas into the Christ child and thereby established a new line of tradition.
The focus of giving gifts shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions as so strict, it only annoys very few that the tradition of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martin's custom with Martin singing and Martin procession, is still a firm part of the Christmas season.
Today you can find everything your heart desires from boots outside the door to stockings and coveted luxury watches under the Christmas tree.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries.
Sources indicate a tradition of gift-giving on the feast day of Saint Nicholas since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christian-influenced countries, there is a cheerful confusion over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Christmas man, who is basically a kind of Santa Claus, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
This includes, for example, his white bushy beard, which has little resemblance to the stricter Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and a preference for the chimney as a means of gaining access to houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost who brought some fame.
Here it's not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ child is responsible for the delivery of gifts.
For the past 3 weeks, I've been getting this error message when trying to download a new book, but my account and contact information are up to date.
Please help me with troubleshooting, as I am experiencing an issue.
otherwise buy another e-Book #PRS_ORG#.
I requested a return label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning.
I was told that something will be sent to me.
Since I have not received anything yet (not even in the SPAM folder), I wanted to inquire now how long this usually takes.
Many thanks.
Police shoot suspected bank robber near the King's Palace.
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who was said to have entered a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a weapon.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle which could be stopped by officers shortly afterwards.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the crime scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one(s)?
No matter where I click, I am immediately redirected to your website.
The decorative light blends harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area or rock garden.
The lamp is simply placed and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and high-performance 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Duration of light max. 10 hrs.
The sturdy plastic design can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally in color.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: It is solely the sun that causes this solar light to shine fascinatingly - either in white or colored light (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is intentionally chosen: during the day, this modern light object presents itself as a naturally formed large pebble.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn, or in the stone bed.
He also performs well in the presence of larger pebbles and boulders in the neighborhood, where he knows how to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparatory work: as a solar light, "Smart Stone" does not require any wiring or batteries.
Place the "light stone" in any location that is exposed to the sun during daylight hours.
Two included ground spikes ensure a secure hold if necessary.
The matte white plastic case itself is sturdy and weather-resistant.
Its solar module discreetly conceals "Smart Stone" within its interior, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
As the dusk sets in, "Smart Stone" automatically begins to glow; in which color, you decide yourself: There are six attractive light colors available to choose from in addition to daylight white.
The shutdown also finally happens automatically as soon as the battery charge level drops to a predetermined minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts again on the next day from the beginning.
I have done that several times already, it doesn't work.
It's a shame, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher isn't credited to me, then I won't order again on principle.
If you change your mind, let me know.
Otherwise, that was the last contact today.

Pill Problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, this is actually my first post after a year on Reddit.
Regarding my problem: About five years ago, I reluctantly started taking the pill again, mainly because I had incredibly bad pain during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
Now I would like to stop this again, because I already have to take enough medication for chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
During my last approximately two-year break, I explosively got pimples from 0 to 100 and they appeared all over my body.
So superficial, but it really burdened me and I didn't feel comfortable.
During the two-year break, everything never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already free of perfume and nonsense, but maybe there is something that someone can recommend to me.
The gynecologist unfortunately did not take me seriously and my appointment with the dermatologist is still pending.
Thanks very much to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, the beloved skin is quite a thing.
Had severe atopic dermatitis during pre-puberty, then a period of calm, then widespread lichen planus and the acne issue.
Regarding my chronic illness, I have tried everything in terms of nutrition and have ended up with a low-sugar, low-dairy, and low-meat mixed diet because nothing else worked as well.
It could also be entirely possible that there's just a hiccup with hormones, but when you have construction going on everywhere like I do, you'd rather not go looking for anything else that might be going wrong.
I already had everything of her colleague Semina or similar.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my request.
I always have to work and answer the phone in between, and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check when the money is there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.
But is it generally available in large size?
since it is available in black and in a large size

In the name of the people: laypeople pass judgments.
In the courtroom they sit on the judge's bench in everyday clothing.
But much depends on their verdict, even if they don't wear robes: lay judges, together with professional judges, determine whether and for how long someone goes behind bars.
Two of them report in conversation with the "Oeffentlichen" about their time at the Bad Kreuznach district court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the district court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately I can't log into my customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice for order number #NUMBER# again to the email address provided above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no means to store them for so long.
We would use the table as offered by you as if it were ours.
Sure, I had already ordered and received the same blue chair in November. Therefore, because they are so beautiful, I would like to order one in grey now.
Does the wardrobe have to be completely dismantled for pick-up and refund?
And when would the pickup be?
110 kV underground cable will be rebuilt in 2022.
The permit for laying the new high-voltage cable in Tann is legally valid.
The planning approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk has now announced.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the northern part of the community with the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a high-voltage transmission tower near the town of Edermanning, close to Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 01/03/21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only partially arrived with us.
The blue order number #PRS_ORG# with tracking number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "delivery not possible."
All three other packages have arrived so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the further procedure is now?
Have a nice start to the week!
You can forget about that, I explained it several times yesterday already!!
This is a glass dresser and all the sides have cracked, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is damaged.
The dresser is in my apartment, and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the dresser cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment.
Thank you for the message.
But why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all the books, which is why the inquiry was made to #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be a general issue.
Ref: Planning lessons (learning outcome)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been in teacher training since summer and I enjoy teaching, but I am currently struggling to plan my geography lessons in a time-efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not equipped with good technology, so basically I can only use the board, the textbook, and an overhead projector as media.
In school, I can only make black and white copies for free (which is annoying for geography).
Currently, I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors and for me, each hour is essentially different.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest excessively much time for simple lessons (since I also need it for exercises, etc.).
I usually start with the learning goal when planning (what do I want to achieve) and then I consider how I can build it up (usually, I create a worksheet with texts from books that are not available at my school).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Therefore, also the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really be pleased/happy.
I would like to return #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to process the return as quickly as possible for now.
The trade fears about the Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
In most stores, only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed to enter.
The industry considers it unnecessary and complains about declining sales.
He also has a possible solution ready.
According to the German Retail Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are spoiling the important Christmas business for retailers.
HDE CEO Stefan Genth criticized a decline in sales for non-daily necessities.
According to a recent survey conducted by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies had a negative outlook for the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year, is now often a bottomless hole," said Genth.
Accordingly, merchants with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It's only going well in the food retail sector and online.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The chief executive officer said that shopping with a mask, maintaining distance and following hygiene protocols is a safe affair.
"2G when shopping does not help us in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of personnel deployment.
He demanded that the band regulation be allowed nationwide.
Afterwards, each customer only has to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores that day with the wristband received.
In addition, in retail - as already in public transportation with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - random checks should be sufficient.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop specializing in shopping centers also spoke of a difficult holiday season.
The frequencies were recently at approximately 75 percent of the pre-corona level without 2G, and revenues were at around 90 percent.
"These figures will certainly fall in the midst of the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to "Wirtschaftswoche" (a German business magazine).
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, attempts are being made to find and obtain solutions for the centers.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof once at a central location in the center and can then enter all shops undisturbed equipped with a bracelet similar to that in a club hotel". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a flaw on the frame that was attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks unpleasant.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and sealed it.
What do I need to do next for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD-LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities is responsible for adjusting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to operate.
The luminaire generates a very high luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively short distance, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in television studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a lit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting as a percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery).
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons and you're done.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the known situation is restored - very practical for studio work, for example, when the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality, which arises from the possibility of operating with cost-effective NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cinematographers (both males and females) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check whether the batteries have sufficient power before the set - it has a built-in battery tester - displaying a value for each of the two battery compartments in the two display screens (left battery in the upper display, right battery in the lower display).
Furthermore, it is, of course, possible to continuously supply the headlight with electricity via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve for attachment as a connection, so you can attach it directly to your camera tripod.
The inclination can be reliably adjusted using locking devices on both sides.
Great care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and therefore designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilting joint is included in the delivery.
Great thing is that a bag is also included in the delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories that you may still want to buy, without any problems.
"Too bad, I received it as a gift and it is too small :("
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a goal-rich comeback against Leverkusen.
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the previously winless Hessen seemed to be heading towards their next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE picked up momentum, venting their frustration over a mediocre start to the season and winning in dazzling fashion with a score of 5-2 within a good hour. "It's insane what the boys achieved today," exclaimed coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN and gave a "general praise for everyone involved".
At the beginning, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, who are still ranked ninth and below their expectations.
Patrik Schick had brought Leverkusen into a 2-0 lead.
What happened then also impressed the SGE coach.
"As the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am insanely happy with the performance we showed and of course with the outcome/result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the field for the first time since the fourth game and his recovered muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly strong," said the 27-year-old, and was particularly happy with the result for the audience.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but also considers himself well-positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are in top physical condition.
It is top-notch work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professional lives.
Now they want to "move forward step by step and remain modest" and complete the tasks "at this level by the turn of the year".
Next, already on Wednesday as part of the English week, there is an away game against Borussia Mönchengladbach (6:30 pm, Sky) on the schedule.
Just now I received the email that my package will be returned to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and redirect it, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and place the order again?
For me, this unfortunately means that I will not order again because it already took a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Setback for women's handball team before quarterfinals against Spain.
Germany's women's handball team walked off the court with drooping heads and empty gazes after being humiliated by Denmark.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection suffered a bitter defeat with a score of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to play against host country Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were much too fearful and had too much respect for the opponent," judged national coach Henk Groener.
We need to approach Spain differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points in second place behind Denmark (10:0).
It is a pity that we could not take the flow with us.
"That was a bad game for all of us that we need to erase," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the qualifying spot in the semifinals, a significant improvement is necessary on Tuesday against the 2019 World Cup runner-up in order to keep the delicate dream alive of the first medal since 2007.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We simply weren't there - neither in the attack nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We need to quickly look forward now."
Not up to par from start to finish.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on top of their game from the kickoff.
Missed shots and technical errors in the attack, as well as gaps in the defense, were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on operating temperature and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully finished a fast counterattack.
However, this was not the hoped for initial spark.
Against the aggressive defending of the Danish women, the German women could hardly find their moments to shine – and when they did, they mostly failed due to the strong performance of Althea Reinhardt in the Scandinavian goalkeeper position.
So the game was over early with a score of 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke also received a red card shortly after for a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter-finals, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection come into the game somewhat better and at least closed the gap to five goals by halftime.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and simply made it easy for the opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round and was in a good mood.
As a result, the German team was unable to muster a performance improvement and left the court as a clear loser.

Does that work for you?
The title dictates that I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
As soon as they are almost finished, it then partly continues for me in vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without any time limit regarding organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not specifically personal (e.g. "I take medication X, does it interact with the vaccine..").
My responsibilities include providing information about vaccination, determining if a person is eligible for vaccination according to the COVID-19 vaccination regulations and if there are no medical reasons against it, keeping medical documentation related to vaccination, and providing emergency treatment in case of allergic reactions, though this has never happened to me before.
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, we often don't have any vaccines available but instead have "only" (not meaning to devalue their contributions!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants who prepare the vaccines but are not permitted to administer them, so I end up administering most of the vaccinations myself.
Difficult "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution.
What exactly is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, submitted by someone from Amberg, there has been a lot of contemplation in the Bavarian Broadcasting television program "Wir in Bayern".
But unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Do you have me?" remained unguessed by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "nervous person".
And also no one who "must have everything done quickly."
People heard from the TV moderator that this was completely wrong.
Whereupon the man from Amberg revealed the solution, causing amazement among many people in the Oberpfalz region.
"The Huidlerer," the viewers learned, "is a rag used to clean the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed that.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
Which closed an educational gap - probably also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy any books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have turned on/restarted the #PRS_ORG#, connected it to the PC, synchronized, and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
Tire selection for road bikes - really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy because I wanted to at least do a little bit of training to prepare for my bike tour next week.
Said and done, I hit the road with my racing bike which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then it happened, what lurks in almost every city center (this time: thanks Krefeld!).
Glass fragments on the road.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire definitely didn't want to finish the rest of the track.
As I didn't have a real possibility to get a spare tire and a spare tube due to the weekday, I had to turn around with somewhat bad mood and take the first available train home.
So, the mood wasn't entirely bad either, and maybe it's better if I practice changing the tires before the bike tour.
Now I have a question and I hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long journey ahead of me over several days, I would extremely unwillingly like to have this problem arise repeatedly.
Now it really wasn't bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who had ridden 120km until 2pm on the day I picked up the bike!) were also suboptimal according to him, as he had used them for several years on a roller.
But if I think about the fact that I have to change a tire after driving 80-90km, then I believe I'll be really cranky :D
Now I got into a conversation at the train platform with an older man who asked me in astonishment why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be unbreakable.
Now this all sounds very tempting.
But are they really so indestructible?
I don't really feel like spending 40€ per tire now, just to be disappointed in the end.
Furthermore, I'm wondering: I think I currently have 25x622 on my road bike.
They may also exist (apparently?) with the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend different tires for a racing bike?
The Schwalbe website seems to recommend the Durano DD to me, to the best of my knowledge!
Thank you in advance for your help and kind regards!
Car skids into tree: Driver fatally injured.
The 53-year-old man had crashed into a median on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten for unknown reasons and subsequently ended up on the opposite side of the road, according to the police.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old there.
The car of the 53-year-old was then thrown against a tree and the man was trapped in the car.
The 27-year-old driver and his 23-year-old passenger were severely injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.
Yes we have. We have deleted all books, reauthorized everything, and loaded new books.

After the launch of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also receive new additions.
"SOLO 15" is the name of the new offspring and visually resembles its big role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this building proposal, a purpose-designed stand is included to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted in length according to the conditions at home.
Principle-wise, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for individuals for whom maximum volume is a relatively minor consideration, but exceptional sound quality is desired.
A 10 cm speaker simply cannot generate such high sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, that does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and extremely impressive and accurate for her size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight increase in high frequencies.
This is generally common with broadband to optimize the increasing focusing of too high frequencies.
Precisely aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with clear and fine sound.
Slightly turning outward can reduce the high frequency range and create a warmer sound image.
Thanks to the point sound source, the localization of the individual components of a music piece is razor-sharp and amazingly precise in the optimal stereo triangle.
The reference-worthy extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure an enemy dynamics that is unparalleled.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also enhances its resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our building kits, it is recommended to think about the final appearance of the speaker at the beginning in order to plan for corresponding changes during construction.
If you want to veneer the housing, for example, the reduction of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds more material.
After all of the plates have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8mm hole in the bottom plate at the appropriate location so that the cable can be easily routed through later.
With the help of a router, the speaker opening is now followed in the front, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be flush-mounted later on.
On the reverse side, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer in order to enlarge the opening surface of the speaker chassis inside as much as possible.
The four screw points of B 100 - 6 OHM will have an interruption in the chamfer, as shown in the "Detail Chamfer" image.
After that, one begins with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls on a level surface in front of oneself.
Now the back panel, lid, front, and bottom are glued on.
In this process, the three stiffenings should also be used and glued.
The stiffnesses themselves can vary in material thickness if one wants to use finished strips from the hardware store instead of making them oneself from 16 mm MDF, for example.
In the next step of the job, the second side will be attached.
After that, all parts of the foot, i.e. both sides as well as the front, follow.
By using a suitable hole saw or Forstner drill, the installation of the openings for the bass reflex tube as well as the connection terminal on the rear wall is facilitated.
Afterwards, you use a round cutter to round off all edges of the actual box.
Also, the top side of the footplate can be rounded with it.
Next, the base plate will be firmly glued to the base of the casing and additionally screwed with long wood screws.
Next comes marking and pre-drilling (with a 2.5 mm drill bit) the screw points for the loudspeaker chassis and the terminal connections.
After cleaning the housing from sawdust (suctioning/blowing out), one starts with laying the cable.
The easiest way to achieve this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear panel.
In doing so, you push the entire and unshortened cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the base up to the terminal opening and leave it protruding there for about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, route the cable to the speaker opening and also let it hang loosely there.
Below, the crossover is prepared and installed.
The construction plan of the frequency divider, as well as the corresponding connection diagram, can be found in the following document: Installation instructions for Solo 15 divider.
Once the frequency divider has been installed and the terminal connector is screwed on, the sealing of the 8mm cable opening inside the box follows, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bass reflex opening and with some skill, one can drop hot glue onto the opening and thus seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, one can check the sealing accordingly.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and fastened with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive wire (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen, a mat of damping material is cut into two pieces and loosely distributed inside the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered in early June instead?
Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will be holding the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, for known reasons it is not possible for us to have more than four people in the studio, which has caused higher planning efforts and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the switch, so we will be tracking the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it is still a pandemic - nevertheless, we will give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Get drinks cold, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
